    "\n",
    "### Part 1: Who Is the Most \"Objective\" Character in *The Sign of the Four*?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part of the lecture, delivered by Karl Hanis (using PowerPoint slides available on Quercus), we discuss the above question, imagining how we might reach an answer using \"analogue\" and \"digital\" tools. Our discussion revolves around three assigned texts:\n",
    "* Arthur Conan Doyle, *The Sign of the Four*\n",
    "* Kathryn Schulz, “What is Distant Reading?”\n",
    "* Catherine D'Ignazio and Lauren Klein, “Why Data Science Needs Feminism”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 2: A Gentle Introduction to JupyterHub, Jupyter Notebooks, Markdown, and Python Code\n",
    "\n",
    "The second part (below) offers a very gentle introduction to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Jupyter Notebooks**. Most lectures will be delivered in the same format/medium in which you will be doing your own work. Unlike slides, they contain \"live code\" that you can run. There are two main types of \"cells\" in Jupyter Notebooks: \"markdown\" cells and \"code\" cells. (AH) \n",
    "* **Markdown**. The difference between Markdown and code cells in Jupyter Notebooks. Introduce some basics like headers, italics, bolding, lists, links. \n",
    "* **Code**. What is Python? What is the point of knowing Python? We'll do some very simple operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. We'll introduce two data types: integers and strings. We'll demonstrate polymorphism, showing that some of the same operators can be text and to numbers, though not all, and not in the same way. \n",
    "* **JupyterHub**: Where is our course work? Where does it live? is it \"in the cloud\"? Why are we accessing it in a browser rather than as a dedicated \"app\" or \"program\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part 3: A Look at the Syllabus; All About Tutorials, Labs, Homework, and MarkUs\n",
    "* Overview of syllabus (KH)\n",
    "* Tutorials, Labs, and Homework (DC)\n",
    "* MarkUs: How to access and and submit your weekly labs (there is no homework this week; we'll discuss it next time) (DC)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helpful Links \n",
    "\n",
    "Most weeks, we will be including links to Melanie Walsh's terrific textbook, [Introduction to Cultural Analytics & Python](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/welcome.html). It's not suuuuper helpful this week, since JupyterHub is a U of T thing and Walsh expects her readers to be accessing notebooks in a slightly different way. But you might still want to have a look at [the introductory page to the material on Python](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/00-Python.html)\n",
