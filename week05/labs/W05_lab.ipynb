    "# Assignment\n",
    "This assignment goes through some familiar code, using a new set of texts: a folder collecting all the Presidential Inaugaral Addresses by U.S. presidents, from George Washington in 1789 to Joe Biden in 2021 (as they are collected [here](https://archive.org/details/Inaugural-Address-Corpus-1789-2009), supplemented from recent ones [here](https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/presidential-documents-archive-guidebook/inaugural-addresses)).✼\n",

    "\n",
    "Below is the code from lecture. It calculates the overall and standardized type-token ratios for a set of files in a folder named `sot4chaps`, outputting its results into two CSV spreadsheet files. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the folder containing the presidential speeches whose TTR we want to calculate is named `speeches`, not `sot4chaps`. Find the line of code that specifies which folder contains the text for which the TTRs will be calculated and modified to reference the `speeches` folder instead. (Note: if you don't modify this code correctly, the below code will generate two empty CSV files.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "For **every single line of code** in the cell below, **add a comment (using `#`) explaining what that line of code does**. Some lines of code appear twice in identical or near-identical form; comment them all, cutting and pasting your explanations if necessary. Comments are not necessary for blank lines with no code in them."

You can also discuss in tutorial whether this was an appropriate way to handle this outlier, and what other options might have been."
