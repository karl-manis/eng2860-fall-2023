All steps and decisions in this supplemental explained in the main Week 8 Lecture Slides.

    "* Create another dictionary in which we assign one of four values for each name: if a name is assigned more than 90% of the time as either male or female, record is as `F` or `M`; if the ratio of assignment doesn't pass that threshold, assign it as `A` (ambiguous).\n",
    "* Extract the first names of all authors in the NYT Best Seller list, store them in a new column `first_name`\n",
    "* For each first name, assign a \"gender signal\" of `F`, `M`, or `A` based on the steps above — or assign `U`/\"unknown\" if the name doesn't appear in our list of names, or `I` if the name is an intial like J. K. Rowling. Store the predicted gender signal in a new column in the dataframe, `gender_signal`.\n",
