    "\n",
    "Think of variables as envelopes or boxes that you can put stuff in. For instance, numbers, words, sentences, paragraphs... novels!\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables have two main aspects: **names** and **values**. The name allows Python to know where to look for the cool contents of the envelope. The \"value\" of the variable are those cool contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've been immersing yourself in literary theory lately... think of \"names\" and \"values\" of variables as corresponding to the \"signifier\" and \"signified\" in the Saussurean sign:\n",
    "\n",
    "![The Saussurean sign](saussure.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "To *put the cool contents into the envelope* (as it were), you need to **assign** a **value** to the **variable**. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python syntax looks like the following — `variable_name = value` — and works as follows:\n",
    "* On the left, you write out the **variable name** you want to use. These names can contain uppercase and lowercase letters A–Z, numbers 0-9, and underscores (`_`). You *cannot* use other punctuation (`.-!?` etc.), or spaces. You can use *pretty much* any name you want, though a few names are reserved for Python's own use, such as `print` and `return` (these special words will appear in green text when you enter them into a Jupyter code cell).\n",
    "* Then you put a *single equals sign*, `=` (don't use a double equals sign, `==`, which we'll talk about in a second). \n",
    "* Then write out the **value** that you want to **assign** to the variable (aka, the stuff you want to put into the envelope). If it's text you want to put into the variable, surround it in quotation marks (`\"` — or `'` if you're British, either works!). If it's a number, just write the number.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may at some point hear that it's \"cool\" or \"efficient\" to use really short variable names like `f` or `n` — or you might see some \" *cool* \" coder using super short names, or catch wind of a rumour that all the \" *tough* \" programmers use short variable names. Nonsense!!! We know lots of words, so let's not be afraid to use them! A descriptive variable name — one that actually makes clear what kind of stuff is inside the envelope — makes your code more readable (to yourself and others) and reinforces your sense of what's actually going on in your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: if you're going to use more than one word for your variable name, it is conventional and reader-friendly to use an underscore `_` to separate these words, rather than just mashing them together. This is called (get ready for it) **snake_case**!\n",

We can do lots of fun things with strings, but we can't treat them like numbers and perform mathematical operations on them, except where \"polymorphism\" applies (see last lecture).\n",
    "* **Integers** `int`: These are what I would call whole numbers. They're numbers without decimal points. They can be positive or negative. We can treat them like numbers (which they are!) and perform mathematical operations on them.\n",
    "* **Floating Point Numbers** `float`: These are numbers, but with decimal points! Although I/AH personally found this piece of terminology unfmailiar when I first started programming, I came come to appreciate it as a cool phrase — and I am not alone in this, clearly, because Pharaoh Sanders has a great album called *Floating Points*.\n",
