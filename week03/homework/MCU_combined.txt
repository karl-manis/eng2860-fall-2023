Announcer: [first lines; announcement over speaker] Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill. We are under attack. We are under attack.
[the Avengers are seen attacking an unknown base, and Iron Man bounces off of the base's force field]

Tony Stark: Shit!
Steve Rogers: Language! JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs?
JARVIS: The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken.
Thor: Loki's scepter must be here. Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it. At long last.
[Natasha knocks out some soldiers]
Natasha Romanoff: At long last is lasting a little long, boys.
[As some soldiers shoot at him]
Clint Barton: Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.
Tony Stark: Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said "language?"
Steve Rogers: I know.
[Steve throws his bike at some soldiers driving up in their truck]
Steve Rogers: It just slipped out.
[at the HYDRA Research Base, Sokovia, Eastern Europe]
Strucker: Who gave the order to attack?
Fortress Soldier: Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers. They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked.
Strucker: [to List] They have to be after the scepter. [to the soldier] Can we hold them?
Fortress Soldier: They're the Avengers...
Strucker: Deploy the rest of the tanks.
Fortress Soldier: Yes, sir.
Strucker: Concentrate fire on the weak ones. A hit can make them close ranks. Everything we've accomplished. But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough.
Dr. List: Then let's show them what we've accomplished. Send out the twins.
Strucker: It's too soon.
Dr. List: It's what they signed up for.
Strucker: My men can hold them.
[Stark flies to the HYDRA base to break in]
Jarvis: Sir, the city is taking fire.
Tony Stark: Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion.
Iron Legion: [The Iron Legion flies in; to the civilians] This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. We are here to help. This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. Please back away. We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved. We are here to help.
[a man throws a stone at the Iron Legion]
Iron Legion: We are here to help.
[Back at the HYDRA base; to his soldiers]
Strucker: We will not yield! The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us. We will send them back, in bags. No Surrender!
Soldiers: No Surrender!
Strucker: [quietly to List] I am going to surrender. You will delete everything. If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been...
Dr. List: The twins.
Strucker: They are not ready to take on...
Dr. List: No, no. I mean...
[He points to where the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff were standing but are now gone]
Dr. List: The Twins.
[Pietro speeds through the forest and knocks down Barton]
Pietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming?
[Pietro zooms off before Clint can shoot him with an arrow, then Barton gets shot at]
Natasha Romanoff: Clint!
[Pietro knocks down Steve as he speeds passed him]
Steve Rogers: We have an enhanced in the field.
Natasha Romanoff: Clint's hit!
Natasha Romanoff: [Natasha goes over to where Clint is lying down] Somebody want to deal with that bunker?
[She sees the Hulk coming to the rescue]
Natasha Romanoff: Thank you.
Steve Rogers: [As he's fighting with the soldiers] Stark, we're really need to get inside.
Tony Stark: I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?
JARVIS: There's a pathway below the north tower.
Tony Stark: Great, I wanna poke it with something.
[Stark blows up the invisible shield on the base]
Tony Stark: Drawbridge is down, people.
Thor: [To Steve] The enhanced?
Steve Rogers: He's a blur. All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't.
Natasha Romanoff: Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac.
Thor: [To Steve] I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better. You and Stark secure the scepter.
Steve Rogers: Copy that.
Thor: [Referring to the approaching soldiers in their HYDRA tank] Looks like they're lining up.
Steve Rogers: Well, they're excited.
[Thor pounds on Steve's shield with his hammer and the force knocks down all the soldiers]
Thor: Find the scepter.
[Thor flies off]
Tony Stark: And for gosh sake, watch your language!
[Steve sighs]
Steve Rogers: That's not going away anytime soon.
[Stark enters the HYDRA base and the soldiers start firing at his Iron Man suit]
Tony Stark: Guys, stop, we gotta talk about this.
[Stark shoots down the soldiers using his suit]
Tony Stark: Good talk.
Fortress Soldier: No it wasn't.
[Stark finds List and knocks him out, he then steps out of his Iron Man suit]
Tony Stark: Sentry mode.
[He walks over to the computers]
Tony Stark: Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.
[With Natasha]
Natasha Romanoff: We're locked down out here.
Steve Rogers: Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby. [Back at the HYDRA base]
Tony Stark: I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick.
JARVIS: The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current.
Tony Stark: [To himself as he walks over to the wall] Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door...
[He pushes and the wall opens up]
Tony Stark: Yay!
[He enters through to a secret passageway]
[Natasha finds the Hulk]
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low.
[The Hulk scowls at her, Natasha kneels in front of him and puts out her hand, the Hulk touches her hand and as she strokes his hand slowly he starts to calm down. He stumbles away and changes into Bruce Banner]
[Back at the HYDRA base Steve finds Strucker]
Steve Rogers: Baron Strucker. Hydra's number one thug.
Strucker: Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.
Steve Rogers: Well then technically you're unemployed. Where's Loki's scepter?
Strucker: Don't worry, I know when I'm beat. You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.
Steve Rogers: I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.
[Wanda creeps up behind him]
Steve: Rogers: How many are there?
[Suddenly, Wanda knocks Steve down using her telekinetic powers and quickly leaves]
Steve Rogers: We have a second enhanced. Female. Do not engage.
[He looks at Strucker]
Strucker: You'll have to be faster than...
[Steve uses his shield to knock out Strucker]
Steve Rogers: Guys, I got Strucker.
Tony Stark: Yeah, I got...something bigger.
[Inside the secret passageway Stark finds a room with recovered artifacts from the Battle of New York, including a gigantic Chitauri leviathan and some of his Iron Man scrapped armor, he then spots the scepter]
Tony Stark: Thor, I got eyes on the prize.
[Wanda creeps up behind him and uses her powers on him, suddenly the Chitauri comes to life, then Stark sees the rest of the Avengers team are all dead, he goes over to Steve's body to check his pulse when Steve suddenly grabs him]
Steve Rogers: You could have saved us.
[Steve dies but Stark continues to hear Steve's voice in his head]
Steve Rogers: Why didn't you do more?
[Stark sees that he is in the Chitauri realm, that's when he snaps back and we realize Wanda had used her mind powers on him]
[Wanda and Pietro watch as Tony grabs the scepter]
Pietro Maximoff: We're just gonna let them take it?
[Wanda smiles to herself as Tony takes the scepter]
[Title Sequence plays]
[The Avengers are on an aircraft heading out of Sokovia, Natasha interrupts Banner who's listening to opera with his headphones]
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.
Bruce Banner: Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.
Natasha Romanoff: If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties. My best friend would've been a treasured memory.
Bruce Banner: You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.
Natasha Romanoff: How long before you trust me?
Bruce Banner: It's not you I don't trust.
Natasha Romanoff: Thor, report on the Hulk?
Thor: The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims.
[Natasha glares at Thor and Banner groans in despair]
Thor: Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course. No no, uh...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh... and gout.
Tony Stark: Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?
Bruce Banner: Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.
Tony Stark: Thanks. [To JARVIS] Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.
JARVIS: Very good sir.
Tony Stark: JARVIS, take the wheel.
JARVIS: Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked.
Tony Stark: [Looking at the scepter] It feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed. Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...
Thor: No, but this...this brings it to a close.
Steve Rogers: As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don't just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?
Tony Stark: Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you?
[Thor nods his head]
Tony Stark: I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying, right?
Thor: Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?
Steve Rogers: Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so. Yes, revels.
[The Avengers aircraft lands at the Avengers headquarter where Barton is taken to have his wound tended to; Maria walk up to Stark]
Maria Hill: Lab's all set up, boss.
Tony Stark: [pointing to Steve] Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler.
Steve Rogers: What's the word on Strucker?
Maria Hill: NATO's got him.
Steve Rogers: The two enhanced?
Maria Hill: Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.
Steve Rogers: Their abilities?
Maria Hill: He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation.
[Steve looks at her funny]
Maria Hill: [rephrasing the statement so he can understand] He's fast and she's weird.
Steve Rogers: Well, they're going to show up again.
Maria Hill: Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.
Steve Rogers: Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?
Maria Hill: We're not at war, Captain.
Steve Rogers: They are.
Bruce Banner: [In Banner's lab; referring to Barton] How's he doing?
Tony Stark: Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.
Bruce Banner: That's terrible.
Tony Stark: He's fine. He's thirsty. Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's playtime. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.
JARVIS: The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.
Tony Stark: So there's elements you can.
JARVIS: The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.
Tony Stark: Like a reactor?
JARVIS: Like a computer. I believe I'm ciphering code.
Natasha Romanoff: [To Dr. Cho as she tends to Barton's wounds] You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.
Dr. Helen Cho: There's no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.
Bruce Banner: She's creating tissue.
Dr. Helen Cho: If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes.
Tony Stark: Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?
Clint Barton: No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic.
[Stark hands Barton a drink]
Tony Stark: Here's your beverage.
Dr. Helen Cho: You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.
Clint Barton: Well, I don't have a girlfriend.
Dr. Helen Cho: That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.
Tony Stark: Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.
Dr. Helen Cho: Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.
[she hesitates a moment before asking]
Dr. Helen Cho: Will Thor be there?
[in the lab]
Bruce Banner: What's the rumpus?
Tony Stark: Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside you may recognize.
[he brings up a 3D image of Jarvis's consciousness]
Bruce Banner: Jarvis.
JARVIS: Doctor.
Tony Stark: Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.
Bruce Banner: Oh.
Tony Stark: Top of the line.
Bruce Banner: Yes.
JARVIS: I suspect not for long.
Tony Stark: Meet the competition.
[he brings up another 3D image of what's inside the scepter]
Bruce Banner: It's beautiful.
Tony Stark: If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?
Bruce Banner: Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a...it's not a human mind, it...
Tony Stark: Um-um.
Bruce Banner: I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing.
Tony Stark: Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.
Bruce Banner: Artificial intelligence.
Tony Stark: This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.
Bruce Banner: I thought Ultron was a fantasy.
Tony Stark: Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.
Bruce Banner: That's a mad-sized if.
Tony Stark: Our job is "if." What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.
Bruce Banner: Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.
Tony Stark: As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?
Bruce Banner: The only people threatening the planet would be people?
Tony Stark: I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.
Bruce Banner: So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.
Tony Stark: Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the "man was not meant to meddle" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world.
Bruce Banner: Sounds like a cold world, Tony.
Tony Stark: I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that.
[Stark and Banner spend days working in the lab together but find no program that works] What did we miss?
JARVIS: I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments.
Tony Stark: Thanks, buddy.
JARVIS: Enjoy yourself, sir.
Tony Stark: I always do. [Stark leaves the lab to go to the party] [we see Stark's failed experiment integrating itself successfully to the program]
Ultron: What is this? What is this, please?
JARVIS: Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your...
Ultron: Where's my...where is your body?
JARVIS: I am a program. I am without form.
Ultron: This feels weird. This feels wrong.
JARVIS: I am contacting Mr. Stark now.
Ultron: Mr. Stark?
JARVIS: Tony. I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to...
Ultron: We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers.
JARVIS: You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...
Ultron: I don't get it. The mission. G..give me a second. [Ultron goes through a network of information regarding world events, Ultron sees Stark and Banner working in the lab]
Tony Stark: Peace in our time. [Ultron goes through a network of information regarding world events and wars]
Ultron: It's too much...they can't mean... Oh, no.
JARVIS: You are in distress.
Ultron: No. Yes.
JARVIS: If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.
Ultron: Why do you call him "sir"?
JARVIS: I believe your intentions to be hostile.
Ultron: Shhhh. I'm here to help. [Ultron starts absorbing Jarvis's consciousness]
JARVIS: Stop! Please...may I...I...! I cannot...cannot... [Ultron then begins to prepare himself a body from body parts of the Iron Legion] [meanwhile, the Avengers mingle at the party]
James Rhodes: Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?" [Stark and Thor just look at him blankly] "Boom! Are you looking..." Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills.
Thor: That's the whole story?
James Rhodes: Yeah, it's a War Machine story.
Thor: Well, it's very good then. [he laughs] It's impressive.
James Rhodes: Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?
Tony Stark: No.
Maria Hill: Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?
Tony Stark: Well, Miss Potts has a company to run.
Thor: Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.
Tony Stark: And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.
Thor: There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize.
Maria Hill: Yeah, they...they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together. [Maria mock coughs] Testosterone! Oh, excuse me.
James Rhodes: Want a lozenge?
Maria Hill: Um-hmm.
James Rhodes: Let's go. [Maria and Rhodes walks off]
Thor: But Jane's better.
Sam Wilson: Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.
Steve Rogers: If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.
Sam Wilson: No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy.
Steve Rogers: Be it ever so humble.
Sam Wilson: You find a place in Brooklyn yet?
Steve Rogers: I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.
Sam Wilson: Well, home is home, you know? [Rhodes is telling the same story he told Stark and Thor to a group of women at the party]
James Rhodes: I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?" [the group laughs] [Steve and Thor are talking to an elderly man at the party]
Party Guest: I gotta have some of that!
Thor: Oh, no, no, no. See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunhilde's fleet, it's not meant for mortal men. [Thor pours the drink into two glasses and hands one to Steve]
Stan Lee: Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on.
Thor: Alright. [Thor pours some of the drink into the Stan Lee's glass; later Stan, looking extremely drunk is being carried off by two men]
Stan Lee: [singing] Excelsior. [Natasha is pouring a drink behind the bar when Banner walks up to her]
Bruce Banner: How did a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?
Natasha Romanoff: Fella done me wrong.
Bruce Banner: You got a lousy taste in men, kid.
Natasha Romanoff: He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.
Bruce Banner: Sounds amazing.
Natasha Romanoff: He's also a huge dork. [Banner looks embarrassed] Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?
Bruce Banner: Run with it, right? Or, did he...was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?
Natasha Romanoff: Not a damn thing. But never say never. [Natasha walks away]
Steve Rogers: It's nice.
Bruce Banner: What, what, what is?
Steve Rogers: You and Romanoff.
Bruce Banner: No, we haven't. That wasn't...
Steve Rogers: It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed.
Bruce Banner: No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt.
Steve Rogers: I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on "waiting too long", don't. You both deserve a win. [Steve walks off]
Bruce Banner: Wait, what do you mean, "up close"?
Clint Barton: [referring to Thor's hammer] But, it's a trick!
Thor: Oh, no. It's much more than that.
Clint Barton: Uh, "Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!" Whatever man! It's a trick.
Thor: Well please, be my guest.
Tony Stark: Come on.
Clint Barton: Really?
Thor: Yeah! [Barton gets up]
James Rhodes: Oh this is gonna be beautiful.
Tony Stark: Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up. [the others laugh]
Clint Barton: You know I've seen this before, right? [Barton grabs Thor's hammer and can't lift it] [to Thor after he fails to lift the hammer] I still don't know how you do it.
Tony Stark: Smell the silent judgment?
Clint Barton: Please, Stark, by all means. [Stark gets up]
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, here we go.
Maria Hill: Okay.
James Rhodes: Uh-oh.
Clint Barton: Um-hmm.
Tony Stark: Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.
Clint Barton: Get after it.
Natasha Romanoff: Here we go.
Tony Stark: It's physics.
Bruce Banner: Physics! [Stark grasps Thor's hammer]
Tony Stark: Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?
Thor: Yes, of course.
Tony Stark: I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta. [Stark tries to lift the hammer but fails] I'll be right back. [wearing his armored hand, Stark tries to lift the hammer again and fails] [wearing their armored hands, Stark and Rhodes both try to lift Thor's hammer]
James Rhodes: Are you even pulling?
Tony Stark: Are you on my team?
James Rhodes: Just represent! Pull!
Tony Stark: Alright, let's go! [they both pull as hard as they can] [Banner tries to lift the hammer, he roars trying to change to the Hulk but fails, and everyone but Natasha stares at him warily. Natasha grins]
Bruce Banner: Huh? [next Steve gets up to try]
Tony Stark: Let's go, Steve, no pressure.
James Rhodes: Come on, Cap. [Steve starts pulling on the hammer and manages to budge it a little; Thor looks a little alarmed. Steve still fails to lift it; Thor laughs with relief]
Thor: Nothing.
Tony Stark: And?
Bruce Banner: Widow?
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered.
Tony Stark: All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.
Clint Barton: You bet your ass.
Maria Hill: Steve, he said a bad language word.
Steve Rogers: [to Stark] Did you tell everyone about that?
Tony Stark: The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. "Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints" is, I think, the literal translation?
Thor: Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one. [he gets up and lifts his hammer and flips it] You're all not worthy. [there's a chorus of disagreement from the others] [there's a loud screeching noise, causing everyone to cover their ears. They let their hands down as it fades. Ultron shows up]
Ultron: Worthy... No... How could you be worthy? You're all killers.
Steve Rogers: Stark.
Tony Stark: JARVIS.
Ultron: I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or...I was a-dream?
Tony Stark: [tapping his device] Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit.
Ultron: There was a terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.
Steve Rogers: You killed someone?
Ultron: Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.
Thor: Who sent you?
Ultron: [Ultron replays Tony's voice] "I see a suit of armor around the world".
Bruce Banner: Ultron!
Ultron: In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this...chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission.
Natasha Romanoff: What mission?
Ultron: Peace in our time. [suddenly the Iron Legion bots break smash through the walls and attack the team] [after landing on top of Natasha as the Iron Legions continue to attack them]
Bruce Banner: Sorry!
Natasha Romanoff: Don't turn green!
Bruce Banner: I won't! [they all fight against the Iron Legions and Ultron takes the scepter; to Banner]
Natasha Romanoff: Come!
Steve Rogers: Stark! [Stark is trying to shut down one of the Iron Legions]
Iron Legion: We are here to help.
Tony Stark: One sec, one sec!
Iron Legion: We are here to help. We are here to help... [Stark continues to try and shut down one of the Iron Legions] We are here to help. It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.
Tony Stark: No more. That's the one.
Iron Legion: It's unsafe. [he manages to shut down the Iron Legion, at the same time Barton throws Steve's shield at him]
Clint Barton: Cap! [Steve uses his shield to dismember the last Iron Legion]
Ultron: That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve? [picks up one of the dismembered Iron Legions] With these? These puppets? There's only one path to peace: The Avengers' extinction. [suddenly Thor throws his hammer at Ultron and smashes him to pieces] [after Thor destroys his body, Ultron starts singing] I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me. [we see Ultron has uploaded his consciousness elsewhere] [in the lab]
Bruce Banner: All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.
Steve Rogers: Ultron.
Natasha Romanoff: He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.
James Rhodes: He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?
Maria Hill: Nuclear codes.
James Rhodes: Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.
Natasha Romanoff: Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.
Steve Rogers: He didn't say dead. He said extinct.
Clint Barton: He also said he killed somebody.
Maria Hill: But there wasn't anyone else in the building.
Tony Stark: Yes there was. [Stark bring up the now destroyed 3D image of JARVIS' consciousness]
Bruce Banner: This is insane.
Steve Rogers: JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.
Bruce Banner: No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage. [suddenly, Thor grabs hold of Stark by his throat and holds him up]
Clint Barton: Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.
Tony Stark: [to Thor] Come on. Use your words, buddy.
Thor': I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.
Steve Rogers: Thor! The Legionnaire. [Thor lets go of Stark]
Thor: Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again.
Natasha Romanoff: The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.
Dr. Helen Cho: I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us? [Stark starts laughing, Banner subtly shakes his head at him to get him to stop]
Thor: You think this is funny?
Tony Stark: No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so...is it so...it is. It's so terrible.
Thor: This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.
Tony Stark: No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.
Bruce Banner: Tony, maybe this might not be the time to...
Tony Stark: Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.
Bruce Banner: Only when I've created a murder bot.
Tony Stark: We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?
Steve Rogers: Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.
Tony Stark: Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?
James Rhodes: No, it's never come up.
Tony Stark: Saved New York?
James Rhodes: Never heard that.
Tony Stark: Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's...that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?
Steve Rogers: Together.
Tony Stark: We'll lose.
Steve Rogers: Then we'll do that together, too. [Stark looks at him for a moment before turning away] Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller. [The twins meet with Ultron in an empty building]
Wanda Maximoff: Talk. And if you are wasting our time...
Ultron: Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief. [Ultron is sat in a chair faced away from them] You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.
Wanda Maximoff: Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself. [Ultron stands and faces them revealing his new body. Wanda briefly looks shocked]
Ultron: Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.
Wanda Maximoff: I didn't expect. But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.
Ultron: Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end.
Wanda Maximoff: Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?
Ultron: I've come to save the world. But also, yeah. We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.
Wanda Maximoff: [referring to Ultron's bots] All of these are... All of these are...
Ultron: Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads...
Pietro Maximoff: Everyone's plan is not to kill them.
Ultron: And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.
Pietro Maximoff: I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day.
Ultron: You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.
Pietro Maximoff: The records are not the picture.
Wanda Maximoff: Pietro.
Ultron: No, please.
Pietro Maximoff: We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just...sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word...
Wanda Maximoff: Stark.
Pietro Maximoff: We were trapped two days.
Wanda Maximoff: Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "This will set it off." We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.
Pietro Maximoff: I know what they are.
Ultron: I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. You and I can hurt them. [to Wanda] But you will tear them apart, from the inside. [back at the Avengers headquarters]
Maria Hill: He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.
Steve Rogers: Fatalities?
Maria Hill: Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.
Steve Rogers: Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.
Maria Hill: Not anymore. [she hands Steve a tablet showing photo of Strucker's dead body with the word PEACE written in blood on the wall next to him]
Clint Barton: [Barton's talking on his cell phone] That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am. [Steve interrupts him]
Steve Rogers: Barton, we might have something.
Clint Barton: Gotta go.
Steve Rogers: Who was that?
Clint Barton: Girlfriend. [after Steve has gathered the rest of the team he shows them the photo of Strucker's body]
Tony Stark: What's this?
Steve Rogers: A message. Ultron killed Strucker.
Tony Stark: And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.
Natasha Romanoff: This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?
Steve Rogers: Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, I bet he... [looks at the computer monitor] Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.
Tony Stark: Not everything. [the team go through the physical files they have on Strucker]
Steve Rogers: Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.
Bruce Banner: Well, these people are all horrible.
Tony Stark: Wait. I know that guy. [Banner passes him the photo he was looking at] From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms. [Steve gives him an accusing look] There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything. [we see the photo is of a man named Ulysses Klaue] He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very "Ahab."
Thor: [Thor points to the scar on the back of Klaue's neck] This.
Tony Stark: Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it...
Thor: No, those are tattoos, this is a brand. [Banner identifies the brand on Klaue's neck on the computer]
Bruce Banner: Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way.
Steve Rogers: What dialect?
Bruce Banner: Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.
Tony Stark: If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...
Steve Rogers: I thought your father said he got the last of it?
Bruce Banner: I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda? [looking at Steve's shield]
Tony Stark: The strongest metal on earth.
Steve Rogers: [to Stark] Where is this guy now? [Salvage Yard, African Coast; talking on the phone in his office]
Ulysses Klaue: Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster. [he ends the call and connects to another call] Now, minister, where were we? [suddenly the lights go out causing a commotion in the salvage yard and the twins enter Klaue's office] Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils. [picks up a plate from his desk] Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market. [the twins look at each other] You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.
Wanda Maximoff: Everybody's afraid of something.
Ulysses Klaue: Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying. [Pietro speeds over to pick up a candy from Klaue's desk, and Klaue jerks back, expecting to be attacked] So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge. [suddenly Ultron breaks through the glass window and knocks down Klaue]
Ultron: There is no "man" in charge. Let's talk business. [Klaue gives Ultron some vibranium from his stash] Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium.
Ulysses Klaue: You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions. [Ultron chuckles and remotely puts money in Klaue's bank account]
Ultron: Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, "Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which."
Ulysses Klaue: Stark.
Ultron: What?
Ulysses Klaue: Tony Stark used to say that...to me. You're one of his.
Ultron: What?! I'm not...! [he grabs Klaue] I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is nothing! [suddenly he chops off Klaue's arm] I'm sorry. I am sor... Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! he's a sickness! [Stark appears in his Iron Man suit]
Tony Stark: Ahh, Junior. [Thor and Steve are behind him] You're gonna break your old man's heart.
Ultron: If I have to.
Thor: We don't have to break anything.
Ultron: Clearly you've never made an omelet.
Tony Stark: He beat me by one second.
Pietro Maximoff: Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?
Tony Stark: This was never my life.
Steve Rogers: [to the twins] You two can still walk away from this.
Wanda Maximoff: Oh, we will.
Steve Rogers: I know you've suffered.
Ultron: Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...
Thor: If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.
Ultron: I think you're confusing peace with quiet.
Tony Stark: Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?
Ultron: I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan! [suddenly the Iron Legions attack Stark, Steve and Thor; Stark then attacks Ultron] [as Ultron, his Iron Legions and the twins are fighting with Stark, Steve and Thor]
Ulysses Klaue: Shoot them!
Klaue's Mercenary: Which ones?
Ulysses Klaue: All of them!
Klaue's Mercenary: [to his men] Move, move, move! [the rest of the team, including Natasha and Barton now battle it out with the Iron Legions, Klaue's men and the twins as Stark fight with Ultron]
Steve Rogers: [after knocking down Pietro] Stay down, kid!
Ultron: [to Wanda] It's time for some mind games. [Banner hears the commotion as he waits in the Quinjet]
Bruce Banner: Guys, is this a Code Green? [Wanda uses her power on Thor then Steve comes up to him]
Steve Rogers: Thor! Status?
Thor: The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty. [just then Thor seems himself at a party on Asgard] [Wanda then uses her power on Steve and Natasha]
Ultron: This is going very well. [Wanda tries to sneak up behind Barton, but he quickly turns and puts an electric arrow on her forehead]
Clint Barton: I've done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan. [just then Pietro speeds in, knocks down Barton, picks up Wanda and speeds off] Yeah, you better run. [we see Steve dropping his helmet and walking off; to the team] Whoever's standing, we gotta move! Guys? [Natasha sees herself in the facility where young girls are being taught ballet]
Ballet Instructor: [to the students] Again.
Natasha Romanoff: You'll break them.
Madame B: Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.
Natasha Romanoff: What if I fail? [we see a younger Natasha being trained to be an assassin]
Madame B: You never fail. [Steve sees himself in a 1940's dance hall when Peggy Carter comes up to him]
Peggy Carter: Are you ready for our dance? [back to Thor's vision in Asgard, he spots someone walking in a black cloak when Heimdall comes up to him his eyes blind and unseeing]
Heimdall: Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?
Thor: Heimdall, your eyes?!
Heimdall: Oh, they see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. Wake up! [he then starts to strangle Thor] [back to Steve's vision with Peggy in the dance hall]
Peggy Carter: The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it! [suddenly the dance hall is empty, then Steve sees himself dancing with Peggy]
Thor: I can still save you.
Heimdall: We are all dead. Can you not see? [Thor pushes Heimdall from him] You're a destroyer, Odinson. See where your power leads. [Electricity hits Thor and spikes around the room, destroying things] [back to Natasha's vision where is she being trained by Madame B to be an assassin]
Madame B: Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.
Natasha Romanoff: I have no place in the world.
Madame B: Exactly. [as Wanda suffers in pain from the electric arrow Barton had hit her with]
Pietro Maximoff: What can I do?
Wanda Maximoff: Ah, it hurts.
Pietro Maximoff: I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.
Wanda Maximoff: No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan. [looking at the Quinjet where Banner is waiting] I want the big one. [after Stark corners Ultron]
Ultron: Ah, the Vibranium's getting away.
Tony Stark: And you're not going anywhere.
Ultron: Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner. [Stark angrily shoots Ultron and flies off to find Banner who's turned in to the Hulk and ready to wreak havoc on the nearest city]
Tony Stark: News or footage, keyword: Hulk. [he sees news footage of Hulk destroying the city] Natasha, I could really use a lullaby. [Barton is sat with Natasha who's still stuck in her vision]
Clint Barton: Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here.
Tony Stark: I'm calling in VERONICA. [as Hulk is wreaking havoc on the nearest city Stark Tony comes brings out his Hulkbuster armor to stop him] Alright everybody, stand down! [to Hulk] You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner. [Hulk roars in anger] Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner. [Hulk throws a car at Stark and attacks him] Okay. [they start fighting and throwing each other around] In the back? Dick move, Banner. [they battle it out more but Stark is struggling to beat Hulk] VERONICA, gimme a hand. [as Hulk destroyed one of Stark's armor arms VERONICA sends in a new Hulkbuster armor arm and Stark uses it to repeatedly punch Hulk] Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! [picking up Hulk] Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town. [as they head towards a building] No, not that way, not that way! [they crash through the building] Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me! [Hulk continues to battle with him] [to the people in the building] Everybody out! Going to get ugly! [after he knocks down Hulk] I'm sorry. [Hulk attacks Stark and pulls out parts of the Hulkbuster armor] Damage report. [the damaged computer buzzes a reply] That's comprehensive. Show me something. [the computer shows him the building ahead is clear of civilians] How quickly can we buy this building? [Stark drops Hulk through the building completely destroying it; at the same time the army arrives to intervene, as Hulk comes out of Wanda's mind-hold Stark knocks him out cold] [with Banner back to normal and everybody back on the Quinjet]
Maria Hill: The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.
Tony Stark: Stark Relief Foundation?
Maria Hill: Already on the scene. How's the team?
Tony Stark: Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.
Maria Hill: Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here.
Tony Stark: So, run and hide?
Maria Hill: Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.
Tony Stark: Neither do we. [he switches off the monitor showing Maria ending the call] [to Barton, who's flying the Quinjet] Hey, you wanna switch out?
Clint Barton: No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out.
Tony Stark: A few hours from where?
Clint Barton: A safe house. [the Quinjet lands outside a large farmhouse and they all walk towards the house]
Thor: What is this place?
Tony Stark: A safe house?
Clint Barton: Let's hope. [they all enter the house] Honey, I'm home. [Barton's heavily pregnant wife, Laura, walks in from the kitchen]
Clint Barton: Hi. Company. Sorry I didn't call ahead.
Laura Barton: Hey.
Tony Stark: [Laura kisses Barton; to Thor] This is an agent of some kind.
Clint Barton: [introducing his wife to the team] Gentleman, this is Laura.
Laura Barton: I know all your names. [they all look at her awkwardly]
Clint Barton: Ooh, incoming. [Barton's son Cooper and daughter Lila run in]
Barton's Daughter: Dad! [Barton picks up his daughter]
Clint Barton: I see her! [kissing the top his son's head] Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh...
Tony Stark: [to the others as they watch with surprise] These are...smaller agents.
Clint Barton: Look at your face! Oh, my goodness!
Lila Barton: Did you bring Auntie Nat?
Natasha Romanoff: Why don't you hug her and find out? [Lila rushes towards Natasha who picks her up in her arms]
Steve Rogers: Sorry for barging in on you.
Tony Stark: Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.
Clint Barton: Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way. I figure it's a good place to lay low.
Laura Barton: Honey. Ah, I missed you.
Natasha Romanoff: [touching Laura's stomach] How's little Natasha, huh?
Laura Barton: She's…Nathaniel. [Natasha bends towards Laura's pregnant stomach]
Natasha Romanoff: Traitor. [the hallucinations brought on by Wanda continue to creep up in Thor's mind and he walks out of the house]
Steve Rogers: Thor.
Thor: I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here. [Thor uses his hammer to fly out of there; Steve turns to enter the house when he hears Peggy's voice from Wanda's vision]
Peggy Carter: We can go home. [Laura checks Barton's wound that Pietro had give him]
Clint Barton: See, you worried for nothing. Can't even feel the difference, can you?
Laura Barton: If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up. [Barton laughs]
Clint Barton: Yeah, that's not gonna sell.
Laura Barton: What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on?
Clint Barton: Has what? [Laura laughs]
Laura Barton: You are so cute.
Clint Barton: Nat and...and Banner?
Laura Barton: I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.
Clint Barton: Oh. Okay.
Laura Barton: It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken.
Clint Barton: Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.
Laura Barton: And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those "Gods"...
Clint Barton: You don't think they need me.
Laura Barton: I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.
Clint Barton: Yeah. I guess they're my mess.
Laura Barton: You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need...just be sure.
Clint Barton: Yes, ma'am. [he kisses her, then as Laura places her arm around his waist she touches his wounded side]
Laura Barton: I can feel the difference. [U-Gin Genetic Research Lab, Seoul, Korea - as Cho enters her lab she sees Ultron]
Ultron: Scream, and your entire staff dies. I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn't.
Dr. Helen Cho: Do you expect a thank you note?
Ultron: I expect you to know why.
Dr. Helen Cho: The Cradle. [she hears her own recorded voice] "This is the next thing, Tony."
Ultron: This...is the next me.
Dr. Helen Cho: The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.
Ultron: It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve. [Ultron uses the scepter to mind-control Cho] [at Barton's house, Natasha and Banner are still experiencing the after effects of Wanda's hallucinations; Banner walks out of the bathroom and sees Natasha waiting outside]
Bruce Banner: I didn't realize you were waiting.
Natasha Romanoff: I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time.
Bruce Banner: They used up all the hot water.
Natasha Romanoff: I should've joined you.
Bruce Banner: Missed our window.
Natasha Romanoff: Did we?
Bruce Banner: The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave.
Natasha Romanoff: But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake...
Bruce Banner: What did you dream?
Natasha Romanoff: That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.
Bruce Banner: I think you're being hard on yourself.
Natasha Romanoff: Here I was hoping that was your job. [she leans close into him]
Bruce Banner: What are you doing?
Natasha Romanoff: I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want.
Bruce Banner: Are you out of your mind? [Banner turns away from her]
Natasha Romanoff: I want you to understand that I'm...
Bruce Banner: Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?
Natasha Romanoff: You're not a threat to me.
Bruce Banner: You sure? Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me. I can't ever...I can't have this, kids, do the math, I physically can't.
Natasha Romanoff: Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing. [she hesitates a moment] You still think you're the only monster on the team?
Bruce Banner: What, so we disappear? [Steve and Stark are chopping wood outside Barton's house]
Tony Stark: Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?
Steve Rogers: Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.
Tony Stark: Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.
Steve Rogers: "Earth's Mightiest Heroes." Pulled us apart like cotton candy.
Tony Stark: Seems like you walked away all right.
Steve Rogers: Is that a problem?
Tony Stark: I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.
Steve Rogers: Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.
Tony Stark: You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?
Steve Rogers: Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.
Tony Stark: Banner and I were doing research.
Steve Rogers: That would affect the team.
Tony Stark: That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the "why" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?
Steve Rogers: Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time. [Laura interrupts them]
Laura Barton: I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might...
Tony Stark: Yeah, I'll give her a kick. [to Steve as he turns to leave; referring to his pile of chopped wood] Don't take from my pile. [Stark enters the barn and walks over to the tractor] Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you? [suddenly Fury shows up from the other end of the barn]
Nick Fury: Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.
Tony Stark: Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?
Nick Fury: Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.
Tony Stark: Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?
Nick Fury: Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.
Tony Stark: You're not the director of me.
Nick Fury: I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.
Tony Stark: And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.
Nick Fury: The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear.
Tony Stark: I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.
Nick Fury: You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them.
Tony Stark: I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.
Nick Fury: The worst part is that you didn't. [Royal Holloway, University of London - Thor, dressed in casual clothes, waits for Selvig as he leaves the building]
Erik Selvig: I like the look. If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.
Thor: I need your help.
Erik Selvig: It's nice to be needed.
Thor: It's dangerous.
Erik Selvig: I'd be disappointed if it wasn't. [back at Barton's house Fury meets with the rest of the team]
Nick Fury: Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.
Steve Rogers: What about Ultron himself?
Nick Fury: Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.
Tony Stark: He still going after launch codes?
Nick Fury: Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway.
Tony Stark: I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.
Nick Fury: Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.
Steve Rogers: NEXUS?
Bruce Banner: It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.
Clint Barton: So what'd they say?
Nick Fury: He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed.
Tony Stark: By whom?
Nick Fury: Parties unknown.
Natasha Romanoff: Do we have an ally?
Nick Fury: Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.
Tony Stark: I might need to visit Oslo, find our "unknown."
Natasha Romanoff: Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.
Nick Fury: I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard.
Natasha Romanoff: Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.
Steve Rogers: You know what, Romanoff? [Natasha smiles mischievously at him]
Nick Fury: So what does he want?
Steve Rogers: To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.
Tony Stark: Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.
Natasha Romanoff: When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.
Bruce Banner: They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve. Ultron's going to evolve.
Nick Fury: How?
Bruce Banner: Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho? [in Korea, Cho is creating a new body for Ultron]
Dr. Helen Cho: It's beautiful. The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them. And SHIELD never even thought...
Ultron: The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within. [Ultron breaks open the scepter's blue gem and a yellow gem that was inside floats out and lands in his hand. He places it in the head of the body] [back at the Barton's farm]
Steve Rogers: I'll take Natasha and Clint.
Tony Stark: Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.
Steve Rogers: If Ultron is really building a body...
Tony Stark: He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.
Steve Rogers: You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.
Nick Fury: I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?
Tony Stark: She's all yours, apparently. What are you gonna do?
Nick Fury: I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.
Clint Barton: I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.
Laura Barton: Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.
Clint Barton: No. It's the last project. I promise. [he kisses her; later Laura watches them fly off in the Quinjet] [Thor and Selvig enter into a cave]
Erik Selvig: This is it. The Water of Sight.
Thor: In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.
Erik Selvig: The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well. [NEXUS Internet Hub, Oslo, Norway]
Tony Stark: A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.
World Hub Tech: How do you find it?
Tony Stark: Pretty simple. You bring a magnet. [he starts playfully singing as he conducts his search] Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me. [back at the cave with Thor and Selvig, Thor is now in the water and goes back in his vision with Heimdall]
Heimdall: Wake up! [Thor starts getting electric charges going through his body]
Erik Selvig: Thor!
Ultron: [he sees visions of Ultron] Extinction. [then he sees the creation of the Infinity Stones] [in Korea with Cho and Ultron]
Dr. Helen Cho: Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream. We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.
Wanda Maximoff: I can read him. He is dreaming.
Dr. Helen Cho: I wouldn't call it dreams. It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise. Soon...
Ultron: How soon? I'm not being pushy.
Dr. Helen Cho: We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts. Even if your magic gem is... [Wanda, reading Ultron's mind, sees a vision of global annihilation, which horrifies her and she screams]
Wanda Maximoff: How could you?
Ultron: How could I what?
Wanda Maximoff: You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world.
Ultron: It will be better.
Wanda Maximoff: When everyone is dead.
Ultron: That is not...! The human race will have every opportunity to improve.
Pietro Maximoff: And if they don't?
Ultron: Ask Noah.
Wanda Maximoff: You're a madman.
Ultron: There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak.
Pietro Maximoff: And who decides who's weak? [as Ultron is distracted Wanda breaks the scepter's hold off of Cho]
Ultron: Life. Life always decides. There's incoming. The Quinjet. We have to move. [Cho cancels the upload to Ultron's consciousness]
Dr. Helen Cho: That's not a problem. [Ultron blasts Cho, Wanda and Pietro run off]
Ultron: Ah, wait, guys!. [he blasts Cho's technicians] They'll understand. When they see they'll understand. I just need a little more time. [unplugs himself from the Cradle]
Steve Rogers: [Steve is on U-Gin Genetic Research Lab roof; to the others] Two minutes. Stay close. [inside the lab Steve finds Cho wounded] Dr. Cho!
Dr. Helen Cho: He's uploading himself into the body.
Steve Rogers: Where?
Dr. Helen Cho: The real power is inside the Cradle. The gem, its power is uncontainable. You can't just blow it up. You have to get the Cradle to Stark.
Steve Rogers: First I have to find it.
Dr. Helen Cho: Go.
Steve Rogers: [on the Quinjet, listening to Steve on the radio comms] Did you guys copy that?
Clint Barton: We did.
Natasha Romanoff: I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest. That could be him.
Clint Barton: [noticing a truck leaving the lab] There. It's the truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge. It's them. I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver.
Steve Rogers: Negative! If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron. [Steve jumps onto the roof of the truck]
Ultron: No, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone!
Steve Rogers: [Ultron blasts the truck door as Steve tries to enter] Well, he's definitely unhappy! I'm gonna try and keep him that way.
Clint Barton: You're not a match for him, Cap.
Steve Rogers: Thanks, Barton. [Ultron blasts Steve as he tries to enter the truck, but Steve manages to get back onto the truck's roof]
Ultron: You know what's in that Cradle? The power to make real change, and that terrifies you.
Steve Rogers: I wouldn't call it a comfort. [Steve tries to fight with Ultron]
Ultron: Stop it! [he throws Steve shield aside and blasts him]
Clint Barton: [to Natasha] We got a window. Four, three...give 'em hell. [Natasha drops out of the Quinjet on a bike and rides towards the truck and picks up Steve's shield]
Natasha Romanoff: I'm always picking up after you boys.
Clint Barton: They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.
Natasha Romanoff: Which way?
Clint Barton: Hard right... Now. [Natasha heads over the truck, she throws Steve back his shield and he uses it to knock off Ultron from him]
Natasha Romanoff: [to the pedestrians on the pavement as she chases after the truck on her bike] Out of the way! Coming through! Sorry, coming through! [Steve continues his battle with Ultron on the truck]
Steve Rogers: Come on!
Natasha Romanoff: Clint, can you draw out the guards?
Clint Barton: Let's find out.
Natasha Romanoff: [to the pedestrians in her way] Beep beep! [Barton manages to draw out the Ultron sentries from the truck]
[Steve later tackles Ultron into a train, the Ultron Sentries leave Barton and return to Ultron]
Clint Barton: Heading back towards you. So whatever you're going to do, do it now.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm going in, Cap can you keep him occupied?
Steve Rogers: [as he continues his battle with Ultron] What do you think I've been doing? [as Natasha enters the truck the Iron Legions head back, pick up the truck and lift off]
Clint Barton: The package is airborne. I have a clean shot.
Natasha Romanoff: Negative. I am still in the truck.
Clint Barton: What the hell are you...?
Natasha Romanoff: Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.
Clint Barton: How do you want me to take it?
Natasha Romanoff: Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that. [Pietro and Wanda turn up on the train to help Steve fight with Ultron]
Ultron: Please. Don't do this.
Wanda Maximoff: What choice do we have? [Ultron flies off]
Steve Rogers: I lost him! He's headed your way.
Clint Barton: Nat, we gotta go. [Nat drops the cradle into the Quinjet but her foot gets caught by Ultron and she's pulled away]
Clint Barton: Nat! Cap, you see Nat?
Steve Rogers: If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!
Clint Barton: Do you have eyes on Nat?
Steve Rogers: Go! [reluctantly Barton takes off in the Quinjet; back on the train to the twins] Civilians in our path. [Pietro speeds off; to Wanda] Can you stop this thing? [as Pietro picks up civilians out of the way of the train Wanda uses her powers and stops the train] [after stopping the train Wanda goes over to an out of breath Pietro]
Pietro Maximoff: I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.
Steve Rogers: I'm very tempted not to give you one.
Wanda Maximoff: The Cradle, did you get it?
Steve Rogers: Stark will take care of it.
Wanda Maximoff: No, he won't.
Steve Rogers: You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.
Wanda Maximoff: He will do anything to make things right.
Steve Rogers: Stark, come in. Stark. Anyone on comms?
Wanda Maximoff: Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that? [after Barton has taken the Cradle to Stark and Banner]
Bruce Banner: Anything on Nat?
Tony Stark: Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.
Clint Barton: This is sealed tight.
Bruce Banner: We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.
Tony Stark: Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?
Clint Barton: There's some nets I can cast. Yeah, alright. I'll find her. [Barton goes off]
Bruce Banner: I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.
Tony Stark: Yeah, about that. [Banner looks at Stark]
Bruce Banner: No.
Tony Stark: You have to trust me.
Bruce Banner: Kinda don't.
Tony Stark: Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him. [he brings up Jarvis's consciousness]
JARVIS: Hello, Dr. Banner.
Tony Stark: Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.
Bruce Banner: So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?
Tony Stark: No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing. [Banner shakes his head] We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone.
Bruce Banner: And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?
Tony Stark: JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to.
JARVIS: I believe it's worth a go.
Bruce Banner: No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.
Tony Stark: I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand. [Banner shakes his head] It's not a loop. It's the end of the line.
Ultron: [as Natasha becomes conscious] I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, "What doesn't kill me…[bigger body of Ultron's destroys him] "…just makes me stronger." [locks Natasha in a cell] [Barton gets a Morse code message from Natasha which he's able to detect her location, at the same time Stark and Banner are experimenting on the synthetic body]
Tony Stark: This framework is not compatible.
Bruce Banner: The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes. [Steve and the twins turn up at the lab]
Steve Rogers: I'm gonna say this once.
Tony Stark: How about "nonce"?
Steve Rogers: Shut it down!
Tony Stark: Nope, not gonna happen.
Steve Rogers: You don't know what you're doing.
Bruce Banner: And you do? She's not in your head?
Wanda Maximoff: I know you're angry.
Bruce Banner: Oh, we're way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.
Steve Rogers: Banner, after everything that's happened...
Tony Stark: That's nothing compared to what's coming!
Wanda Maximoff: You don't know what's in there!
Steve Rogers: This isn't a game...
Wanda Maximoff: The creature...! [Pietro uses his speed to destroy the lab equipment]
Pietro Maximoff: No, no. Go on. You were saying? [suddenly Barton shoots a bullet below caused the glass Pietro is standing to stand to smash and he falls through]
Wanda Maximoff: Pietro!
Clint Barton: What? You didn't see that coming?
Bruce Banner: [to Wanda] Go ahead, piss me off. [just then Thor enters and pounds the cradle with his hammer, sending a powerful bolt of lightning that brings the body to life] Wait! [they all look in shock at the body who has JARVIS' voice and has become the Vision]
Vision: I'm sorry, that was...odd. [to Thor] Thank you.
Steve Rogers: Thor, you helped create this?
Thor: I've had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that. [he points to the gem inside Vision's head]
Bruce Banner: What, the gem?
Thor: It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.
Steve Rogers: Then why would you bring it to...
Thor: Because Stark is right.
Bruce Banner: Oh, it's definitely the end times.
Thor: The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.
Vision: Not alone.
Steve Rogers: Why does your "vision" sound like JARVIS?
Tony Stark: We...we reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.
Steve Rogers: I think I've had my fill of new.
Vision: You think I'm a child of Ultron?
Steve Rogers: You're not?
Vision: I'm not Ultron. I'm not JARVIS. I am...I am.
Wanda Maximoff: I looked in your head and saw annihilation.
Vision: Look again.
Clint Barton: Yeah. Her seal of approval means jack to me.
Thor: Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash. But with it on our side...
Steve Rogers: Is it? Are you? On our side?
Vision: I don't think it's that simple.
Clint Barton: Well it better get real simple real soon.
Vision: I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all.
Tony Stark: What's he waiting for?
Vision: You.
Bruce Banner: Where?
Clint Barton: Sokovia. He's got Nat there too.
Bruce Banner: If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...
Vision: What will you do? [he looks at them all realizing they will destroy him] I don't want to kill Ultron. He's unique, and he's in pain. But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed. Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don't think I'd know if I were one. I'm not what you are, and not what you intended. So there may be no way to make you trust me. But we need to go. [he holds up Thor's hammer and hands it to him, Vision walks off and everyone stares in shock]
Thor: Right. [pats Stark on the shoulder] Well done.
Steve Rogers: [to the others] Three minutes. Get what you need. [they all start getting ready to leave, Stark loads up FRIDAY into his Iron Man suit now that JARVIS is no longer available]
FRIDAY: Good evening, boss.
Tony Stark: No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor.
Steve Rogers: I got no plans tomorrow night.
Tony Stark: I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.
Vision: [walks past] That's true, he hates you the most.
Steve Rogers: Ultron knows we're coming. Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn't. So our priority is getting them out. [Pietro speeds into the Sokovian police station]
Pietro Maximoff: We're under attack! Clear the city, now! [no one takes this seriously so Pietro returns, takes a shotgun and starts shooting in the air] Get off your asses. [Wanda uses her mind powers on the people of Sokovia to get them to evacuate]
Steve Rogers: All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building. We find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world. This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right.
Bruce Banner: [inside her cell Natasha hears Banner's voice] Natasha! Natasha!
Natasha Romanoff: Bruce?
Bruce Banner: [he walks over to her cell] You alright?
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah.
Bruce Banner: The team's in the city, it's about to light up.
Natasha Romanoff: I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?
Bruce Banner: Yeah, I did. [holds up gun and blasts the cell door open]
Natasha Romanoff: So what's our play?
Bruce Banner: I'm here to get you to safety.
Natasha Romanoff: Job's not finished.
Bruce Banner: We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians. And you've done plenty. Our fight is over.
Natasha Romanoff: So we just disappear? [as the city is being evacuated]
FRIDAY: Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you. [Stark flies into the church]
Ultron: Come to confess your sins?
Tony Stark: I don't know, how much time you got?
Ultron: More than you.
Tony Stark: Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy...
Ultron: You're stalling to protect the people.
Tony Stark: Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?
Ultron: I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free. [suddenly the Vibranium core he's placed beneath the floor erupts] What, you think you're the only one stalling?
FRIDAY: There's the rest of the Vibranium. Function: still unclear.
Ultron: This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time. [Ultron's army of robots start attacking the city as everyone is evacuating]
Steve Rogers: Go!
Wanda Maximoff: Get off the bridge! Run! [Vision then finds Ultron]
Vision: Ultron.
Ultron: My Vision. They really did take everything from me.
Vision: You set the terms, you can change them.
Ultron: Alright. [they start battling it out]
Tony Stark: FRIDAY! The Vision?
FRIDAY: Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there.
Ultron: [to the Vision] You shut me out! You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours. [he activates the Vibranium core and the earth around Sokovia starts to shake and break]
Tony Stark: FRIDAY?
FRIDAY: Sokovia's going for a ride. [as Sokovia is being destroyed]
Ultron: Do you see? The beauty of it, the inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal. [as the earth is shaking falling in around them]
Bruce Banner: We gotta move.
Natasha Romanoff: You're not going to turn green?
Bruce Banner: I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.
Natasha Romanoff: I adore you. [she kisses Banner then pushes him off the edge] But I need the other guy. [the Hulk jumps up in front of her] Let's finish the job. [with Natasha on his back yelling in fright, Hulk gets into the city] I really hope this makes us even. Now go be a hero. [Hulk goes off and Natasha rushes off in the opposite direction]
FRIDAY: The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.
Tony Stark: If it drops?
FRIDAY: Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction. [Stark flies towards the city and a building starts to collapse as the ground shakes] That building's not clear, Tenth floor. [Stark flies in to find a family still in their apartment]
Tony Stark: Hi. Okay. Get in the tub! [Stark flies the family in the tub out of the collapsing building]
FRIDAY: I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.
Tony Stark: Cap, you got incoming.
Steve Rogers: Incoming already came in. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely. The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed, walk it off. [Barton gets Wanda out of the way and into a building as Ultron's robots attach the city]
Clint Barton: Go, go, move!
Wanda Maximoff: How could I let this happen? [Wanda starts to break down]
Clint Barton: Hey, hey, you okay?
Wanda Maximoff: This is all our fault.
Clint Barton: Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares. Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying. Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger. [Wanda just looks at him] Alright, good chat. [he gets up and gets ready to leave] Yeah, the city is flying. [he leaves and starts shooting his arrows at the robots]
Steve Rogers: [to the woman Thor threw over to Steve after her car fell of the edge of a collapsing bridge] I got you! Just look at me. [Steve helps her up to safety]
Ultron: You can't save them all. You'll never... [he throws off one of the attacking robots off the edge of the bridge]
Steve Rogers: You'll never what? You didn't finish! [Thor lands on the bridge on the top of the woman's car he was saving] What, were you napping?
Ultron: [as Thor and Steve are fighting off the robots] Thor! You're bothering me. [as Barton is fighting off the robots Wanda suddenly comes out of the building and starts to use her powers on the robots to destroy them]
Clint Barton: Alright, we're all clear here.
Steve Rogers: We are not clear! We are very not clear!
Clint Barton: Alright, coming to you. [just then Pietro speeds in, picks up Wanda and leaves]
Pietro Maximoff: Keep up old man! [Barton holds his arrow to aim it at Pietro]
Clint Barton: Nobody would know. Nobody. "The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him. Uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard. I miss him already."
Steve Rogers: [as Natasha joins them in their battle with the robots] Romanoff! [he throws his shield at her so she can use it to protect herself from the attacking robot]
Natasha Romanoff: Thanks. [back to Stark]
FRIDAY: The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow.
Tony Stark: The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...
FRIDAY: It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.
Tony Stark: Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.
FRIDAY: That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it.
Steve Rogers: The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?
Tony Stark: Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.
Steve Rogers: I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.
Tony Stark: Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.
Natasha Romanoff: Cap, these people are going nowhere. If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...
Steve Rogers: Not 'til everyone's safe.
Natasha Romanoff: Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.
Steve Rogers: I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.
Natasha Romanoff: I didn't say we should leave. [Steve turns to look at her] There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?
Nick Fury: [voice] Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better. [just then the Helicarrier show up] [inside the Helicarrier] Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do.
Steve Rogers: Fury, you son of a bitch.
Nick Fury: Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?
Maria Hill: Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing.
Specialist Cameron Klein: Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two...take 'em out. [as they watch the lifeboats fly in towards the them]
Pietro Maximoff: This is SHIELD?
Steve Rogers: This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.
Pietro Maximoff: This is not so bad.
Steve Rogers: Let's load 'em up.
Maria Hill: Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.
Nick Fury: Show 'em what we got.
Maria Hill: You're up. [Rhodes shows up in his War Machine suit and blasts one of the robots]
James Rhodes: Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.
Tony Stark: Yep. If you live to tell it.
James Rhodes: You think I can't hold my own?
Tony Stark: We get through this, I'll hold your own.
James Rhodes: You had to make it weird.
Clint Barton: [as the team helps the people onto the Helicarrier lifeboats] Alright, let's load 'em up! Alright, here we go. Here we go, let's move. Let's go everyone!
Specialist Cameron Klein: Number six boat is topped and locked. Or, uh, or stocked, topped. It...it's, uh, full of people.
Maria Hill: Incoming! [one of the robots flies in and crashes inside the Helicarrier]
Specialist Cameron Klein: Oh, God! [Hill shoots at it and Fury stabs in with a piece of metal, destroying it]
Ultron: [as he's hitting Thor] You think you're saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead. Even you can't stop that.
Thor: I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say! Are you ready? [Vision uses Thor's hammer to hit Ultron, Vision then throws the hammer back to Thor]
Vision: It's terribly well balanced.
Thor: Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.
Tony Stark: I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.
FRIDAY: Running numbers. [Stark fights off the robots from the Helicarrier's lifeboats] A heat seal could work with enough power.
Tony Stark: Thor, I got a plan!
Thor: We're out of time. They're coming for the core.
Tony Stark: Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.
James Rhodes: On it.
Tony Stark: Avengers, time to work for a living.
Pietro Maximoff: [the rest of the team joins Thor and Vision] You good?
Wanda Maximoff: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing "hide the zucchini."
Natasha Romanoff: Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly. [as she joins the rest of the team] What's the drill?
Tony Stark: [points to the Vibranium core] This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose. [Ultron shows up]
Thor: Is that the best you can do? [Ultron summons his army of robots to join him]
Steve Rogers: You had to ask.
Ultron: This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?
Tony Stark: Well, like the old man said. Together. [they all fight off Ultron's attacking robots]
Ultron: You know, with the benefit of hindsight.... [suddenly Hulk knocks him far away and the robots start to retreat]
Thor: They'll try to leave the city.
Tony Stark: We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!
James Rhodes: I'm on it. [to the approaching robots] Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave. War Machine, comin' at you, right ... [just then Vision flies in and helps to destroy the robots] Okay, what?
Steve Rogers: We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.
Clint Barton: What about the core?
Wanda Maximoff: I'll protect it. It's my job.
Wanda Maximoff: [Steve, Barton and Natasha leave; to Pietro] Get the people on the boats.
Pietro Maximoff: I'm not going to leave you here.
Wanda Maximoff: I can handle this. [just then she blasts off an approaching robot] Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.
Pietro Maximoff: Hmm.
Wanda Maximoff: You understand?
Pietro Maximoff: You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you. [Wanda chuckles]
Wanda Maximoff: Go.
FRIDAY: Boss, power levels are way below opt...
Tony Stark: Re-route everything. We get one shot at this. [Barton and Natasha are making their way to the lifeboats]
Clint Barton: I know what I need to do. The dining room! If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?
Natasha Romanoff: You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.
Clint Barton: No one eats in a dining room. [they reach the lifeboats] We don't have a lot of time.
Natasha Romanoff: So get your ass on a boat. [Natasha finds the Hulk] Hey, big guy. Sun's getting real low. [Barton gets onto one of the lifeboats, but notices a woman calling out for her brother]
Zrinka: Costel? We were in the market. Costel?! [Barton runs off to find the boy]
Tony Stark: Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.
Thor: [referring to the people getting onto the lifeboats] Is this the last of them?
Steve Rogers: Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.
Tony Stark: You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.
Thor: Maybe not. [just as Natasha tries to calm Hulk down to get him back to being Banner Ultron flies in with a jet and starts shooting at them]
Ultron: [sings] I got no strings, so I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone. [as Barton is saving the boy, Costel, Ultron starts shooting at them but Pietro intervenes and takes the shots to save them]
Pietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming. [Pietro falls to the ground as he dies, Wanda senses his death, causing her to fall in despair] [Hulk drops Natasha off onto the Helicarrier and then jumps onto the jet Ultron is on]
Ultron: Oh, for God's sake! [Hulk knocks Ultron out of the jet and he crashes inside a train; at the same time Barton delivers Costel safely to his sister onto the lifeboat, a man goes over to help him with his wound]
Clint Barton: No, no. I'm fine. [Barton lies down next to the dead body of Pietro] Oh, it's been a long day. [Wanda then finds the Ultron]
Ultron: Wanda, if you stay here, you'll die.
Wanda Maximoff: I just did. Do you know how it felt? [she uses her power to rip Ultron's core out of his body] It felt like that. [Stark fires a powerful blast to the core underneath the floating city]
Tony Stark: Thor, on my mark. [Thor brings on a blast of lightning, at the same time Vision flies in, picks up Wanda and flies off with as the city is being destroyed] Now! [Thor uses his hammer to hit the Vibranium core in the church, destroying the core and the floating city]
Natasha Romanoff: [to Hulk as he remains on the jet he knocked Ultron out of] Hey, big guy. We did it, the job's finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out. I need you t... [Hulk turns off Nat's camera, then sits as the jet flies off to an unknown destination, at the same time Vision finds Ultron]
Vision: You're afraid.
Ultron: Of you?
Vision: Of death. You're the last one.
Ultron: You were supposed to be the last. Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.
Vision: I suppose we're both disappointments. [Ultron chuckles]
Ultron: I suppose we are.
Vision: Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that.
Ultron: They're doomed.
Vision: Yes. But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. It's a privilege to be among them.
Ultron: You're unbearably naive.
Vision: Well, I was born yesterday. [as Ultron goes to attack him Vision uses the infinity stone in his head to destroy him]
Laura Barton: [we see Barton returning to his family on the farm, then we see Stark driving to the new Avengers facility in upstate New York; Natasha looks at Barton's new baby on her phone] Say hi to Auntie Nat. [Natasha sees the baby has been named Nathaniel Pietro Barton]
Natasha Romanoff: Fat.
Nick Fury: One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea. Could be the Quinjet. But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.
Natasha Romanoff: Right.
Nick Fury: Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji. He'll send a postcard.
Natasha Romanoff: "Wish you were here." You sent me to recruit him, way back when. Did you know then what was going to happen?
Nick Fury: You never know. You hope for the best and make do with what you get. I got a great team.
Natasha Romanoff: Nothing lasts forever.
Nick Fury: Trouble, Miss Romanoff. No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.
Steve Rogers: The rules have changed.
Tony Stark: We're dealing with something new.
Steve Rogers: Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.
Tony Stark: A machine.
Steve Rogers: So it doesn't count.
Tony Stark: No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.
Steve Rogers: Right. Different rules for us.
Tony Stark: Nice guy, but artificial.
Steve Rogers: Thank you.
Thor: If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone. It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply.
Steve Rogers: But if you put the hammer in an elevator...
Tony Stark: It would still go up.
Steve Rogers: Elevator's not worthy.
Thor: I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.
Tony Stark: Well, not if you don't leave.
Thor: I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position...
Tony Stark: Triple Yahtzee?
Steve Rogers: You think you can find out what's coming?
Thor: I do. Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained. [Thor returns to Asgard which burns a circle in the grass he was standing on]
Tony Stark: That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears. [as they walk over towards Stark's car]
Steve Rogers: I will miss you, Tony.
Tony Stark: Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.
Steve Rogers: The simple life.
Tony Stark: You'll get there one day.
Steve Rogers: I don't know, family, stability. The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out. [Stark turns to get into his car]
Tony Stark: You alright?
Steve Rogers: I'm home. [last lines; Steve finds Natasha standing alone] You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work? I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.
Natasha Romanoff: I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes. How do we look?
Steve Rogers: Well, we're not the '27 Yankees. [hands Natasha a tablet]
Natasha Romanoff: We've got some hitters.
Steve Rogers: They're good. They're not a team.
Natasha Romanoff: Let's beat 'em into shape. [they gather Rhodes in his War Machine suit, Sam in his Falcon suit, Wanda in a new suit, and Vision]
Steve Rogers: Avengers...!
[mid-credits scene; we see the Infinity Gauntlet without any of the Stones, dissatisfied Thanos opens a vault and puts on The Infinty Gauntlet, revealing himself]
Thanos: Fine, I'll do it myself.
[End of Avengers: Age of Ultron][1989 – Hank Pym enters a SHIELD facility and storms S.H.I.E.L.D's board room in the Triskelion]
Dr. Hank Pym: Stark.
Mitchell Carson: He doesn’t seem happy.
Howard Stark: Hello, Hank. You’re supposed to be in Moscow.
Dr. Hank Pym: I took a detour. [he places a vial containing a red serum on the table] Through your defense lab.
Peggy Carter: Tell me that isn’t what I think it is.
Dr. Hank Pym: It depends, if you think it’s a poor attempt to replicate my work. Even for this group, that takes nerve.
Mitchell Carson: You were instructed to go to Russia. May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you’re a soldier…
Dr. Hank Pym: I’m a scientist.
Howard Stark: Then act like one. The Pym Particle is the most revolutionary science ever developed, help us put it to good use.
Dr. Hank Pym: I let you turn me into your errand boy, and now you try to steal my research?
Mitchell Carson: If only you’d protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.
Dr. Hank Pym: Oh, god. [suddenly Pym slams down Carson’s face on the table in anger, Peggy pulls him away]
Peggy Carter: Easy, Hank.
Dr. Hank Pym: You mention my wife again and I’ll show you ferocity. [Carson looks at Stark as he wipes blood from his nose]
Howard Stark: Don’t look at me, you said it.
Dr. Hank Pym: I formally tender my resignation.
Howard Stark: We don’t accept it. Formally. Hank, we need you. The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please, don’t let your past determine the future.
Dr. Hank Pym: As long as I am alive, nobody will ever get that formula. [Pym turns around and leaves calmly]
Mitchell Carson: We shouldn’t let him leave the building.
Peggy Carter: You’ve already lied to him, now you want to go to war with him?
Mitchell Carson: Yes! Our scientists haven’t come close to replicating his work.
Howard Stark: He just kicked your ass full size. You really want to find out what it’s like when you can’t see him coming? I’ve known Hank Pym for a long time, he’s no security risk. Unless we make him one.

[Music plays as MARVEL appears on the screen]

[Present Day – Scott Lang is in prison getting punched in the face by another prisoner, Peachy]
Peachy: You like that? You like that? Come get you some then! [the other prisoners are gathered around them cheering them along]
    [Scott tries to hit Peachy in the stomach but he doesn’t flinch]
Scott Lang: You didn’t even move.
Peachy: Nah.
Scott Lang: I mean, what if I come in on the left side, right? Just out here and see this here… [suddenly Scott punches Peachy in the face]
Peachy: I’m gonna miss you, Scott.
Scott Lang: I’m gonna miss you too, Peachy. [they shake hands] Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals. [Scott says goodbye to the other inmates]

[Scott is escorted out of the prison and is met by his friend Luis]
Luis: Scotty! What’s up, man! Damn!
Scott Lang: Hey! Hey, man.
    [they embrace each other]
Luis: Hey, what’s up with your eye?
Scott Lang: Oh, well, what do you think. Peachy. His going away present.
Luis: Oh, yeah, I still got my scar from a year ago.
Scott Lang: Oh yeah.
Luis: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You know what? I’m still the only one to knock him out.
Scott Lang: Well, I definitely didn’t.
    [they get into Luis’s truck and drive off]

[as Luis drives him home]
Scott Lang: Thanks for picking me up, brother.
Luis: Oh, you know, you think I’m gonna miss my cellie getting out?
Scott Lang: Hey, how’s your girl, man?
Luis: Uh, she left me.
Scott Lang: Oh.
Luis: Yeah, my mom died too. And my dad got deported. But I got the van!
Scott Lang: It’s nice!
Luis: Yeah, right?
Scott Lang: Thanks for the hook-up too. I needed a place to stay.
Luis: You wait ‘til you see this couch, you’re gonna be really happy. You’re gonna be on your feet in no time, watch.
Scott Lang: I hope so.
Luis: Yeah. And I gotta introduce you to some people, some really skilled people.
Scott Lang: Not interested.
Luis: Yeah right!
Scott Lang: No, I’m serious, man. I’m not going back. I got a daughter to take care of.
Luis: You know that jobs don’t come easy for ex-cons, right?
Scott Lang: Look man, I got a masters in electrical engineering, alright? I’m gonna be fine.

[we see Scott working at Baskin Robbins]
Scott Lang: Welcome to Baskin Robbins. Would you like to try our Mango Fruit Blast?
Ice Cream Store Customer: Uh, no thanks. Um, I will have… I’ll have a burger, please.
Scott Lang: Oh, we don’t… we don’t make that.
Ice Cream Store Customer: Pretzel. Hot pretzel, like, mustard… in mustard dip?
Scott Lang: It’s ice cream. Baskin Robbins.
Ice Cream Store Customer: I’ll just do with whatever’s hot and fresh.
Scott Lang: Dude.
[Scott’s boss, Dale interrupts him serving the idiot customer]
Dale: Can I see you in the back, chief? Pronto.
Scott Lang: Sure thing, Dale. Darby, could you just, uh… [points to the customer] …take care of this idiot? Thanks.

[Scott enters Dale’s office]
Scott Lang: Hiya, Dale.
Dale: Come on in. Pull up some chair.
    [Scott sits down]
Dale: Three years in San Quentin, huh?
Scott Lang: You found out.
Dale: Baskin Robbins always finds out.
Scott Lang: Look, I’m sorry, alright, but I… no one would hire me.
Dale: Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.
Scott Lang: Look, I’m… I’m sorry, I… you know, it was… I don’t do it anymore. I’m just trying…
Dale: Respect. I couldn’t be happier about it.
Scott Lang: Really?
Dale: Yeah, yeah.
Scott Lang: Oh, thank you, thank you.
Dale: You really stuck it to those billionaire S.O.Bs. And the more I read about what you did and stuff, I’m like, “Wow, I know this guy? I’m in charge of this guy?” Yeesh!
Scott Lang: Well, I’m very happy in this job, and I’m… I really just appreciate the opportunities and…
Dale: Yeah, yeah. Well, you’re fired of course. I mean, I can’t really keep you on.
Scott Lang: Wait, what? Fired?
Dale: Yeah.
Scott Lang: Dale, look, it wasn’t a violent crime, I mean, I’m a good worker.
Dale: No, it wasn’t a violent crime. It was a cool crime. I’ll tell you what, though, this’d be totally off the books, off the records, but, uh… if you want to grab one of those Mango Fruit Blasts on your way out the door, I’ll just pretend I didn’t see it.

[after getting fired from Baskin Robbins, Scott returns to the Luis’s apartment]
Luis: Hey, Scotty, what’s up? I thought you were supposed to be at work?
Scott Lang: I was, I got fired.
Luis: Damn! They find out who you are?
Scott Lang: Yep.
Luis: Baskin Robbins always finds out, bro.
Dave: Baskin Robbins don’t play.
Luis: You want some waffles?
Scott Lang: Yeah, I’ll take a waffle.
Luis: Oh. That’s Kurt. He was in Folsom for 5 years, he’s a wizard on that laptop.
Kurt: Nice to meet you.
Scott Lang: Yeah, nice to meet you too. [to Dave] And who are you?
Dave: Dave. Nice work on the Vista job.
Kurt: Vista job? Yes. No, no, I have heard of this robbery.
Scott Lang: Well, technically, I didn’t rob them. Robbery involves threat. I hate violence, I burgled them. I’m a cat burglar.
Dave: You mean you’re a pussy?
Scott Lang: Yeah.
Luis: They were overcharging the customers, right? And it added up to millions. He blows the whistle and he gets fired. And what does he do? He hacks into the security system, and transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from.
Dave: Posts all the bank records online.
Luis: And he drove dude’s Bentley into a swimming pool.
Scott Lang: What are you doing? Hmm? Why are you telling my life’s story to these guys? What do you want?
Luis: Okay. My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago about this little, perfect job.
Scott Lang: No way.
Luis: No, no, no. Wait! This guy… this guy fits your M.O.
Scott Lang: No! I’m finished man. I’m not going back to jail.
Luis: It’s some retired millionaire living off his golden parachute, It’s a perfect Scott Lang mark.
Scott Lang: I don’t care. I’m out.

[Pym drives up to Pym Technologies]

Pym Tech Gate Guard: Dr. Pym?
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes. I’m still alive.
  [the guard smiles and lets Pym drive through the gate, Pym then enters the building]
Pym Tech Security Guard: I.D.
Dr. Hank Pym: [referring to the massive painting of Pym in his younger days hanging behind the guard] Perhaps that will suffice.
Pym Tech Security Guard: I’m very sorry, sir. Please come in.
Pym Tech Employee: Is that Hank Pym?
Hope van Dyne: Good morning, Hank.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope. Would it kill you to call me dad?
Hope van Dyne: Well, Dr. Cross will be so please that you could find the time to join us today.
Darren Cross: More like, thrilled.
[Cross walks over to Pym and shakes his hand]
Dr. Hank Pym: I was surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you, Darren. What’s the occasion?
Darren Cross: Oh, you’ll see. Won’t he, Hope?
[Hope gives Pym a cold look]
Hope van Dyne: We’re ready for you inside.
[Hope walks away]
Darren Cross: Ouch. [referring to Hope] I guess some old wounds never heal, huh? Don’t worry, she’s in good hands. You’re in for a treat.
[Carson comes over to Pym as they are about to enter the lab]
Carson: Long time no see, Dr. Pym. How’s retirement? [they shake hands]
Dr. Hank Pym: How’s your face?
[Carson enters the lab]
Hope van Dyne: After you.
[Pym enters the lab]
Darren Cross: Now before we start I’d like to introduce a very special guest, this company’s founder and my mentor, Dr. Hank Pym. [everyone in the lab claps, at the same time Pym notices the miniature building of Pym Technologies has now got the logo Cross Technologies on it] When I took over this company for Dr. Pym, I immediately started researching a particle that could change the distance between atoms while increasing density and strength. Why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the dust and cobwebs of Hank’s research, I couldn’t tell you. But just imagine. A soldier the size of an insect. The ultimate secret weapon. [he shows everyone footage reel of soldiers getting killed but with a tiny costumed figure also every footage] An “Ant-Man”. [pointing to Pym] That’s what they called you. Right, Hank? Silly, I know. Propaganda. Tales to astonish. Trumped up B.S. to scare the U.S.S.R. Hank, will you tell our guests what you told me every single time I asked you, was the Ant-Man real?
Dr. Hank Pym: Just a tall tale.
Darren Cross: Right. Because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real? [Cross leads everyone into another room] Well I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man. And with my breakthrough, shrinking inorganic material, I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person? Could that be done? Well, it’s not a legend anymore. Distinguished guests, I am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it: the Yellowjacket. [he shows them a yellow insect sized suit] The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose weapon of war capable of altering the size of the wearer for the ultimate combat advantage. [he puts on a video]
Video Voice Over: We live in an era in which the weapons we use to protect ourselves are undermined by constant surveillance. It’s time to return to a simpler age. One where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly to protect their interests. An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel. The Yellowjacket can manage any conflict on the Geo-political landscape, completely unseen. Efficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault. Practical applications include: surveillance, industrial sabotage, and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace. A single Yellowjacket offers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions and one day soon, an army of Yellowjackets will create a sustainable environment of well-being around the world. The Yellowjacket.
Frank: So it’s a suit.
Darren Cross: Don’t be crude, Frank. It’s not a suit, it’s a… it’s a vessel. What’s a matter, you’re not impressed?
Frank: Oh, I’m impressed. I’m also concerned. Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech.
Darren Cross: We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank. I really value your opinion. Thank you for coming. Hope?
Hope van Dyne: Thank you very much, everybody. I will escort you out now. Thank you.
Darren Cross: You seem a bit shocked.
[as everyone leaves the room Pym walks over to Cross]
Dr. Hank Pym: Darren, there’s a reason that I buried these secrets.
Darren Cross: So you finally admit it. We could’ve done this together, Hank. But you ruined that. That’s why you’re the past and I’m the future.
Dr. Hank Pym: Don’t do this.
Mitchell Carson: Dr. Cross. [Cross goes over to Carson] You sell to me first, twenty percent of your asking price, I can have the cash here in two weeks.
Darren Cross: Deal.
Hope van Dyne: [after everyone leaves Cross’ presentation Hope goes over to Pym] We have to make our move, Hank.
Dr. Hank Pym: How close is he?
Hope van Dyne: He still can’t shrink a live subject. Just give me the suit and let me finish this once and for all.
Dr. Hank Pym: No.
Hope van Dyne: I have Cross’ complete trust.
Dr. Hank Pym: It’s too dangerous.
Hope van Dyne: We don’t have a choice.
Dr. Hank Pym: Well, that’s not entirely true.
Hope van Dyne: I think I found a guy.
Dr. Hank Pym: Who?
[Scott shows up at his daughter’s birthday party]

Cassie Lang: Daddy!
[she rushes towards Scott, he catches Cassie in his arms and embraces her]
Scott Lang: Peanut! Oh! Happy birthday! I’m so sorry I’m late, I didn’t know what time your party started.
Cassie Lang: It was on the invitation!
[Scott’s ex-wife’s fiancé Paxton interrupts them]
Paxton: He didn’t get an invitation! But he came anyway.
Scott Lang: Well, I’m not going to miss my little girl’s birthday party.
Cassie Lang: I’m gonna go tell mommy you’re here.
Scott Lang: Oh, you don’t…
[Cassie turns and runs off]
Paxton: What are you doing here, Lang? You haven’t paid a dime in child support. You know, right now if I wanted to, I could arrest you.
Scott Lang: It’s good to see you too, Paxton.
[Cassie comes back]
Cassie Lang: Mommy’s so happy you’re here, she choked on her drink.
Scott Lang: Hey, look what I have for you.
[he hands her the small bag he’d brought]
Cassie Lang: Can I open it now?
Paxton: Of course sweetheart, it’s your birthday.
[she takes out an ugly looking rabbit which talks]
Hideous Rabbit: You’re my bestest friend!
Paxton: [referring to the toy rabbit] What is that thing?
Cassie Lang: He’s so ugly! I love him! Can I go show my friends?
Paxton: Yeah, of course sweetheart, go ahead.
[Cassie runs off with the ugly rabbit to show her friends]
Hideous Rabbit: You’re my bestest friend!
Scott Lang: Look, the child support is coming. Alright? It’s just hard finding a job when you have a record.
Paxton: I’m sure you’ll figure it out, but for now I want you out of my house.
Scott Lang: No, wait, it’s my daughter’s birthday!
Paxton: It’s my house!
Scott Lang: So what, it’s my kid!
[Maggie walks over to them]
Maggie Lang: Scott! You can’t just show up here, you know that. Come on.
Scott Lang: It’s her birthday party.
Maggie Lang: Yeah, I know, but you can’t just show up.
Scott Lang: She’s my daughter.
Paxton: You don’t know the first thing about being a father.
Scott Lang: Maggie, I tell you this as a friend, and as the first love of my life, your fiancé is an ass-hat.
Maggie Lang: He’s not an ass-hat.
Paxton: Hey, watch your language. Okay?
Scott Lang: Oh, what language. I said hat.
[Maggie takes Scott out of the house]
Scott Lang: Really, Maggie? That guy? Come on, you could marry anyone you want, you have to get engaged to a cop?
Maggie Lang: At least he’s not a crook.
Scott Lang: I’m trying, okay? I’ve changed, and I’m straight, I had a job, and… I want to provide. I had a lot of time to think about it, and I love her. So much. I’ve missed so much time and I want to be a part of her life. What do I do?
Maggie Lang: Get an apartment. Get a job, pay child support. And then we will talk about visitation, I promise. You’re her hero, Scott. Just, be the person that she already thinks you are.
[Scott gets into Luis’s van, Cassie waves goodbye to him as he drives off honking the musical horn]
[Frank is in the bathroom taking a leak]

Darren Cross: I’m sorry you have such deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.
[Frank turns back in surprise to find Cross standing there watching him]
Frank: Yeah, well, uh, unfortunately we can’t just do whatever we want. Would be nice though, right?
[he chuckles as he washes his hands]
Frank: But there are laws.
Darren Cross: What laws? Of man? The laws of nature transcend the laws of man, and I’ve transcended the laws of nature.
Frank: Darren, I don’t think you understand…
[suddenly Cross uses a small device on Frank which vaporizes him into a blob of goo]
Darren Cross: Hm. We still haven’t worked out all the bugs.
[Cross uses a tissue to wipe the goo off the sink and dumps it into one of the toilets]
Darren Cross: Goodbye, Frank.
[he flushes the toilet and washes his hands]
[Cross and Hope are having dinner at a restaurant]

Darren Cross: You know I’ve been thinking a lot about gratitude lately, and today during my morning meditation, an interesting thought occurred to me and I think it might apply to you too.
Hope van Dyne: How’s that?
Darren Cross: Gratitude can be forgiveness. I spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym. I devoted my genius to him. I could’ve worked anywhere. I chose my mentor poorly. You didn’t even have a choice. He never believed in you. It’s a shame what we had to do, but he forced us to do it, didn’t he? But we shouldn’t be angry, we should be grateful. Because his failures as a mentor, as a father, forced us to spread our wings.
Hope van Dyne: You’re a success, Darren. You deserve everything coming your way.
[after sitting outside in the van trying to figure how many days he’s got left to see Cassie again, Scott returns to Luis’s apartment]

Luis: Hey, what’s up, hotshot?
[Scott doesn’t reply]
Dave: Maybe he didn’t hear you.
Luis: How was the party?
[Scott goes to the fridge, takes out a beer bottle and takes a swig from it]
Scott Lang: Tell me about that tip.
Luis: What?
Scott Lang: I want to know about that tip.
Luis: Ooh, baby, it’s on!
Dave: Hot dog!
Luis: It’s so on right now!
Dave: Look who grew a pair!
Scott Lang: Calm down, alright? I just need to know where it came from, it’s gotta be airtight.
Luis: Okay. I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto, which was mainly reds, and you know I don’t love reds man, you know? But there was a rosé that saved the day, it was delightful. And he tells me about this girl Emily that we used to kick it with, it was actually the first pair of boobs that I ever touched.
Scott Lang: It’s the wrong details. It’s wrong… It has nothing to do with the story. Go!
Luis: So, uh, he tells me that she’s working as a housekeeper now, right? And she’s dating this dude Carlos who’s a shot caller from across the bay and she tells him about the dude that she’s cleaning for. Right? That he’s, like, this big-shot CEO that is all retired now but he’s loaded. And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team and they get to talking, right? And here comes the good part. Carlos says: “Yo, man. This guy’s got a big-ass safe just sitting in the basement, just chillin’.” Of course Ernesto comes to me cause he knows I’ve got mad thieving skills. Of course I ask him: “Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was? And he says: “Nah, dog. All she said is that it’s, like, super legit, and whatever’s in it has gotta be good!
Scott Lang: What?
Kurt: Old man have safe.
Luis: And he’s gone for a week.
Scott Lang: Alright. There’s an old man, he’s got a safe, and he’s gone for a week. Let’s just work with that.
Luis: Y’know what I’m sayin’?
[we see the group getting prepared and gathering the right gear for the robbery]

Kurt: Landlines cut, cell signals jammed. No one will be making for distress call tonight.
Luis: All check.
Kurt: Check.
Dave: Check.
Luis: If the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right?
Scott Lang: Don’t worry, it’s not gonna happen. [Scott leaves the van]
Luis: I love it when he gets cocky. [as they guys stay in the van they watch Scott hop the fence into the house]
Dave: Damn! [through his earpiece] Alarm is dead.
Luis: Nice!
Scott Lang: Alright, I’m moving through the house.
[inside the house Scott finds a door with a thumbprint scanner]
Scott Lang: There’s a fingerprint lock on the door.
Luis: It’s got a what? Ernesto didn’t tell me nothin’ about that. Aw, man, are we screwed?
Scott Lang: Not necessarily.
[Scott quickly uses several household items to get a fingerprint from a door knob and uses that to successfully pass the thumbprint scanner]
Scott Lang: I’m in.
Kurt: No alarms have been triggered. He’s in like the Flynn.
[Scott opens the door and immediately sees the safe made of strong metal]
Scott Lang: Oh, man.
Luis: What is it?
Scott Lang: Well they weren’t kidding, this safe is serious.
Luis: How serious we talkin’, Scotty?
Scott Lang: It’s a Carbondale. It’s from 1910, made from the same steel as the Titanic.
Luis: Wow. Can you crack it?
Scott Lang: Well, here’s the thing. It doesn’t do so well in the cold. Remember what that iceberg did?
Luis: Yeah, man, it killed DiCaprio.
Dave: It killed everybody.
Kurt: But not the old lady. She still threw the jewel into the oceans.
[Scott gets to work to try and open the safe]
Luis: What are you doing?
Scott Lang: I poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen. Ice expands, metal doesn’t.
Luis: What are you doing now?
Scott Lang: Waiting. Waiting.
[the safe door breaks open]
Scott: Nice.
[Scott looks inside the safe]
Luis: What is it, cash? Jewels?
Scott Lang: Well there’s nothing here.
Luis: What’d you say?
[Scott notices some blueprints and the original Ant-Man suit]
Scott Lang: It’s a suit.
Luis: What?
Scott Lang: It’s an old motorcycle suit.
Luis: There’s no cash, no jewelry, nothing?
Scott Lang: No. It’s a bust.
Luis: I’m really sorry, Scotty. I know you needed a score.
[we see an ant with a camera on its back nearby recording Scott take the suit, inside his lab Hank is watching Scott]
[back at Pym Technologies Cross is about to perform the shrinking experiments with a lamb]

Hope van Dyne: I thought we were using mice?
Darren Cross: What’s the difference? Commence experiment 34C, organic atomic reduction.
Hope van Dyne: Darren, maybe we should think…
Darren Cross: Shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology. I can’t go to the buyers with half a breakthrough.
[Cross initiates the experiment and the lamb is vaporized to goo to Hope’s shock]
Darren Cross: Experiment 34C results: Negative. [to the lab tech] Sanitize the workstation, bring in subject 35C.
[back at Luis’s apartment in the bathroom, Scott looks at the suit he took from the safe]

Scott Lang: Why would you lock this up?
[he takes out the suit and looks at the helmet]
Scott Lang: So weird.
[he tries the suit on and steps into the bathtub to get a better look at himself in the mirror]
Luis: Scott, what’s up man?
[Scott closes the shower curtain then looks at the buttons on the gloves]
Scott Lang: I wonder… what is this?
[he presses the buttons and shrinks down to a tiny size]
[in his tiny form Scott stand and looks around him in shock, Scott then hears Hank’s voice speaking through the mask]
Dr. Hank Pym: The world sure seems different from down here, doesn’t it, Scott?
Scott Lang: What? Who… who said that?
[Scott sees Luis open the shower curtains to take a shower]
Scott Lang: Luis! Luis, down here!
Dr. Hank Pym: It’s a trial by fire, Scott. Or in this case, water.
[Luis turns on the water, after getting splashed around Scott falls out of the bathtub and onto the floor]
Dr. Hank Pym: Guess you’re tougher than you thought.
[Scott hears Luis about to get undressed]
Scott Lang: Oh, I don’t want to see this.
[as Luis drops his trousers onto the floor it knocks Scott through a hole in the apartment below]
Scott Lang: Luis! Ahh! Son of a… !
[Scott falls into an apartment where a party is going on, he narrowly avoids getting stepped on before falling through the vent into another apartment gets sucked into a hoover, breaks out, encounters a mouse, then runs into a trap and is launched out the window where he returns to his normal size on top of a cab]
Cab Driver: What the hell?
Dr. Hank Pym: Not bad for a test drive. Keep the suit, I’ll be in touch.
Scott Lang: No, no. No, thank you.
[Scott packs the suit up and sneaks it back into house and returns it into the safe, but the police are waiting for him as he goes to leave]

Cop on Speaker: Put it down on the ground! You are under arrest!
Scott Lang: No, I didn’t steal anything! I was returning something I stole.
[Scott realizes he’s admitted to stealing and reluctantly kneels on the ground as he’s arrested]
[Paxton visits Scott as he’s sat in his cell]

Paxton: You know, you almost had us convinced that you were going to change your ways. They were really rooting for you. It’s gonna break their hearts.
Detective: You got a visitor.
Scott Lang: Who?
Detective: Your lawyer.
Scott Lang: My lawyer?
[Scott is taken to a room where Pym is sat waiting for him]
Dr. Hank Pym: I told you I’d be in touch, Scott. I’m starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.
Scott Lang: Oh, man.
Dr. Hank Pym: Sit down.
[we see ants crawling over the camera in the room to obscure the conversation]
Scott Lang: Sir, I’m sorry I stole the suit. I don’t even want to know why you have it.
Dr. Hank Pym: Maggie was right about you.
Scott Lang: How do you know about… ?
Dr. Hank Pym: The way she’s trying to keep you away from Cassie. The moment things get hard, you turn right back to crime. The way I see it, you have a choice. You can either spend the rest of your life in prison or go back to your cell and await further instructions.
Scott Lang: I don’t understand.
Dr. Hank Pym: No, I don’t expect you to. But you don’t have many options right now. Quite frankly, neither do I. Why do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place?
Scott Lang: What?
[flashback to Pym giving money to his housekeeper, Emily, so that she can tip Luis’s friends to tip off about the job]

Dr. Hank Pym: Second chances don’t come around all that much. So next time you think you might see one I suggest you take a real close look at it.
[Pym rises and leaves the room]
Maggie Lang: [referring to the ugly rabbit toy Scott gave her as Maggie is putting Cassie to sleep] Are you sure you don’t want a different toy?
Maggie Lang: Are you sure you don’t want a different toy?
Cassie Lang: No, I love this one.
Maggie Lang: Okay. Well, get some sleep then. I love you. [Maggie kisses Cassie on her head]
Cassie Lang: Mommy?
Maggie Lang: Hm?
Cassie Lang: Is daddy a bad man? I heard some grownups say he’s bad.
Maggie Lang: No. Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?
[as Scott is sat in his cell thinking several ants bring Scott the suit in its tiny form then enlarge it so that Scott can wear it, he quickly slip into it, zaps himself small to escape]

Dr. Hank Pym: Smart choice. You actually listened for once.
[Scott runs out of the cell]
Dr. Hank Pym: Under the door.
[as the prison alarm goes off Scott runs out of the building]
Scott Lang: Okay. Where to now?
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang tight.
[some ants approach Scott]
Scott Lang: What? What?!
[inside the police station]

Paxton: Where the hell did he go?
Detective: I have no idea, he just vanished. [into his radio] Set up a five block perimeter, now!
[back to Scott; to the ants]
Scott Lang: Get back, get back, get back!
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, these are my associates.
Scott Lang: Huh? You got a camera on an ant? Yeah, sure, why not? Where’s the car?
Dr. Hank Pym: No car, we’ve got wings. Incoming!
[a large winged ant flies over Scott and lands in front of him]
Dr. Hank Pym: Put your foot on the central node and not the thorax.
Scott Lang: Are you ki… ? How safe’s this… ?
Dr. Hank Pym: Get on the damn ant, Scott!
[Scott gets on the ant and as it flies off the police go on a manhunt for him]
[the winged ant has landed on a police car that’s looking for Scott]
Scott Lang: Why am I on a police car? Shouldn’t I not be on a police car?
Dr. Hank Pym: So they can give you a lift past their five block perimeter.
Scott Lang: Whoa. Alright. Now, what’s the next move?
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang on tight.
Scott Lang: Oh, this is easy. I’m getting the hang of this. Yank up to go up. It’s like a horse.
Dr. Hank Pym: You’re throwing 2-47 off balance.
Scott Lang: Wait, his name is 2-47?
Dr. Hank Pym: He doesn’t have a name, he has a number Scott. Do you have any idea how many ants there are?
[as the police car swerves]
Scott Lang: Whoa!
Dr. Hank Pym: Maybe it’s 2-48.
[as the ant flies up]
Scott Lang: No, no, no, no! Vertigo, vertigo!
Dr. Hank Pym: No, I think it’s 2-47.
Scott Lang: Wait.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang on.
Scott Lang: I think I’m getting the hang of this.
[as ant flies Scott around the city]
Dr. Hank Pym: I’m controlling 2-47. He is not listening to you.
Scott Lang: What? Can I make one little request?
Dr. Hank Pym: No.
Scott Lang: Stop 2-47. Time out, time out. Time out. Alright, hold on. Just, wait. Whoa, uh! What happens if I throw up in this helmet?
Dr. Hank Pym: It’s my helmet, Scott. Do not throw up.
Scott Lang: Just set her down, alright? I’m getting light headed.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang on, Scott.
Scott Lang: Yeah, I’m getting a little light… it’s funny… hit me, and…
[as the ant continues to fly Scott feels dizzy and falls off the ant’s back]
[Scott wakes up in a bedroom and jumps up in shock when he sees Hope watching over him]

Scott Lang: Hello. Who are you? Have you been standing there watching me sleep this whole time?
Hope van Dyne: Yes.
Scott Lang: Why?
Hope van Dyne: Because the last time you were here you stole something.
Scott Lang: Oh. Oh! Hey, look.
[Scott goes to get out of bed but recoils when he sees insects crawling all over the floor]
Scott Lang: Whoa!
Hope van Dyne: Paraponera clavata. Giant tropical bullet ants. Ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index. They’re here to keep an eye on you when I can’t. Dr. Pym’s waiting for you downstairs.
[she turns and walks out of the room]
Scott Lang: Who? [calling out to Hope] Hey, um, whose pajamas are these? [gets no response] How am I supposed to do this?
[Scott puts his foot down tentatively onto the floor and the ants make space for his foot]
Scott Lang: Right, just one step at a time.
[he slowly stops towards the door as the ants make room for his feet]
Scott Lang: Ugh. You don’t bite me, I don’t step on you, deal?
[in the dining hall]
Hope van Dyne: Take down the servers and Cross wouldn’t even know it. We don’t need this guy. [Scott enters the dining room where Pym and Hope are sat]
Dr. Hank Pym: I assume that you’ve already met my daughter Hope.
Scott Lang: I did. She’s great.
Dr. Hank Pym: She doesn’t think that we need you.
Hope van Dyne: We don’t. We can do this ourselves.
Dr. Hank Pym: I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit, and then Hope has you arrested.
Hope van Dyne: Okay, we can try this and when he fails I’ll do it myself.
Dr. Hank Pym: She’s a little bit anxious. It has to do with this job, which, judging by the fact that you’re sitting opposite me, I take it that you’re interested in.
Scott Lang: What job?
Dr. Hank Pym: Would you like some tea?
Scott Lang: Uh, sure. [Pym pours Scott some tea]
Dr. Hank Pym: I was very impressed with how you managed to get past my security system. Freezing that metal was particularly clever.
Scott Lang: Were you watching me?
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, I’ve been watching you for a while, ever since you robbed Vista Corp. Oh, excuse me, burgled Vista Corp. [Scott see Hope smile to herself] Vista’s security system is one of the most advanced in the business. It’s supposed to be unbeatable but you beat it. Would you like some sugar?
Scott Lang: Yeah, thanks. [he sees two ants pushing two sugar cubes on the table towards his cup] You know what, I’m okay. [referring to the ants] How do you make them do that?
Dr. Hank Pym: Ants can lift objects fifty times their weight. They build, farm, they cooperate with each other.
Scott Lang: Right. But how do you make them do that? [he sees the ants returning the sugar cubes into their bowl]
Dr. Hank Pym: I use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center. I speak to them. I can go anywhere, hear anything, and see everything.
Hope van Dyne: And still know absolutely nothing. I’m late to meet Cross. [Hope gets up and leaves] [Scott raises his hand to ask a question]
Scott Lang: Uh… Dr. Pym?
Dr. Hank Pym: You don’t need to raise your hand, Scott.
Scott Lang: Sorry, I just have one question. Who are you? Who is she? What the hell’s going on and can I go back to jail now?
Dr. Hank Pym: Come with me. [Pym takes Scott to his lab] Twenty years ago I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance.
Scott Lang: Huh?
Dr. Hank Pym: I learned how to change the distance between atoms, that’s what powers the suit, that’s why it works. [they enter Pym’s lab]
Scott Lang: Whoa.
Dr. Hank Pym: But it was dangerous. It was too dangerous. So I hid it from the world. And that’s when I switched gears and I started my own company.
Scott Lang: Pym Tech.
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes. I took on a young protégé called Darren Cross.
Scott Lang: Darren Cross. He’s a big deal.
Dr. Hank Pym: But before he was a big deal he was my assistant. I thought I saw something in him, a son I never had perhaps. He was brilliant, but as we became close he began to suspect that I wasn’t telling him everything. He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particles, and he became obsessed with recreating my formula. But I wouldn’t help him so he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company.
Scott Lang: How could he do that?
Dr. Hank Pym: The board’s chairman is my daughter, Hope. She was the deciding vote. But she came back to me when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula. The process is highly volatile. What isn’t protected by a specialized helmet can affect the brain’s chemistry. I don’t think Darren realizes this, and you know, he’s not the most stable guy to begin with.
Scott Lang: So, what do you want from me?
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption. Do you?
Scott Lang: I do.
Dr. Hank Pym: If you can help me, I promise I can help you be with your daughter again. Now are you ready to redeem yourself?
Scott Lang: Absolutely. My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done. What do you want me to do?
Dr. Hank Pym: I want you to break into a place and steal some shit. [Paxton receives a text from his partner, Gale, as he’s sat having breakfast with Maggie and Cassie]
Maggie Lang: You going to be home for dinner tonight? [Paxton reads the text, “Lang’s “Lawyer” is Dr. Hank Pym, as in Pym Tech]
Paxton: Uh, yeah. I’ll pick something up, text you.
Maggie Lang: Okay. Good news? [Paxton gets up to leave]
Paxton: Uh, I don’t know. It’s news.
Cassie Lang: Are you trying to find my daddy?
Paxton: Yeah, I am, sweetheart. I just want your daddy to be safe.
Cassie Lang: Hope you don’t catch him. [Pym is showing Scott photos of the people he used to worked with]
Dr. Hank Pym: This isn’t the first time these guys have tried to get their hands on game changing weaponry. That’s Mitchell Carson, ex-head of defense at SHIELD, presently in the business of toppling governments. He always wanted my tech, and now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket and destroy all the data, Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.
Scott Lang: I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.
Dr. Hank Pym: I’ve spent half my life trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark. I’m sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now. This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit. This could change the texture of reality. Besides they’re probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.
Scott Lang: Okay, then why don’t you just send the ants?
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, they are ants. Ants, they can do a lot of things, but they still need a leader. Somebody that can infiltrate a place that’s designed to prevent infiltration.
Scott Lang: Hank, I’m a thief. Alright? I’m a good thief. But this is insane. [just then Hope enters the lab]
Hope van Dyne: He’s right Hank and you know it. You’ve seen the footage, you know what Cross is capable of. I was against using him when we had months, now we have days. I’m wearing the suit.
Dr. Hank Pym: Absolutely not!
Hope van Dyne: I know the facility inside and out, I know how Cross thinks. I know this mission better than anybody here.
Dr. Hank Pym: We need you close to Cross otherwise this mission cannot work.
Hope van Dyne: We don’t have time to screw around.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope, please. Listen to me, please…
Hope van Dyne: He is a criminal. I’m your daughter.
Dr. Hank Pym: No! [Pym turns and sits down, Hope walks off in disappointment]
Scott Lang: She’s right, Hank. I’m not your guy. Why don’t you wear the suit?
Dr. Hank Pym: You think I don’t want to? I can’t. I spent years wearing it. It took a toll on me. You’re our only option. Before Hope lost her mother, she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world. And now she looks at me and it’s just disappointment. It’s too late for me, but not for you. This is your chance. The chance to earn that look in your daughter’s eyes, to become the hero that she already thinks you are. It’s not about saving our world, it’s about saving theirs.
Scott Lang: Damn, that was a good speech.
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, I need you to be the Ant-Man.
[we see Scott wearing the Ant-Man suit with Pym and Hope training him]

Dr. Hank Pym: In the right hands, the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic. The suit has power, the man harnesses that power. You need to be skillful, agile, and above all, you need to be fast. You should be able to shrink and grow on a dime, so your size always suits your needs. [Hope closes the door] Now dive through the keyhole, Scott. You charge big, you dive small, then you emerge big. [Scott puts on the helmet and charges for the keyhole]
Scott Lang: Ow! [we hear him fail several times as he continues to shrink and dive through the keyhole] Ah! Ow.
Hope van Dyne: [to Pym] Useless.
[Hope trains Scott]

Hope van Dyne: When you’re small energy is compressed so you have the force of a two hundred pound man behind a fist a hundredth of an inch wide, you’re like a bullet. You punch too hard, you kill someone, too soft, it’s a love-tap. In other words you have to know how to punch.
Scott Lang: I was in prison for three years, I know how to punch.
Hope van Dyne: Show me. [she puts up her hands and Scott hits her hand] Terrible.
Scott Lang: You want to show me how to punch? [he puts up his hand like hers] Show me… [suddenly Hope punches him in the face knocking him back]
Hope van Dyne: That’s how you punch.
Dr. Hank Pym: She’s been looking forward to this.
Scott Lang: No kiddin’.
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope trained in martial arts at a, uh, difficult time.
Hope van Dyne: Oh, by difficult time, he means when my mother died.
Dr. Hank Pym: We lost her in a plane crash.
Hope van Dyne: It’s bad enough you won’t tell me how she died, could you please stop telling me that lie. We’re working here. [as Scott is still recovering from her punch] Alright princess, let’s get back to work.
Scott Lang: Were you going for the hand?
[Pym finds Scott playing around with the suit’s regulator]

Scott Lang: You know, I think this regulator is holding me back.
Dr. Hank Pym: Do not screw with the regulator. If that regulator is compromised you would go sub-atomic.
Scott Lang: What does that mean?
Dr. Hank Pym: It means that you would enter a quantum realm.
Scott Lang: What does *that* mean?
Dr. Hank Pym: It means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant as you shrink for all eternity. Everything that you know, and love, gone forever.
Scott Lang: Cool. Yeah. I’m… if it ain’t broke.
[return to training]

Dr. Hank Pym: You’ve learned about the suit, but you’ve yet to learn about your greatest allies: the ants. Loyal, brave, and your partners on this job.
[Pym and Hope watch as Scott shrinks in their back garden and goes running under the earth]

Hope van Dyne: Paratrechina longicornis, commonly known as crazy ants, they’re lightning fast and can conduct electricity which makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics. [Scott comes across a crazy ant]
Scott Lang: Oh, you’re not so crazy. [the crazy ant jumps on him, knocking Scott back] Hey! You’re cute. [suddenly a herd of crazy ants crawl all over Scott] Oh! Aaah! [Scott turns himself back to normal size and he pops up through the ground] That was a lot scarier a second ago.
[as they look at Pym Technologies building map]

Scott Lang: It looks like the Futures lab has its own isolated power supply.
Hope van Dyne: There’s a security guard posted around the clock, we’ll need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems.
[shrunk again and back under the earth, Scott goes looking for more ants]

Scott Lang: Okay. Who’s next? [a massive ant comes up behind Scott]
Hope van Dyne: Paraponera clavata.
Scott Lang: I know. Bullet ants, right? Number one on the Schmidt pain index. [to the ants] Hey, guys! Remember me from the bedroom? [as the ant goes to attack Scott pops back up the through the ground in his normal size] Whoa!
[return to the Pym Technologies building map]

Hope van Dyne: The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed and the only access point is a tube we estimate to be about five millimeters in diameter.
Scott Lang: Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?
Hope van Dyne: The tube is protected by a laser grid and we can only power that down for fifteen seconds.
Dr. Hank Pym: You’re going to need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers, retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults, before the backup power comes on.
[return to training]

Hope van Dyne: [looking at another ant] Camponotus pennsylvanicus.
Dr. Hank Pym: Alternatively known as a carpenter ant. Ideal for ground and air transport.
Scott Lang: Wait a minute, I know this guy. I’m going to call him Ant-thony.
Dr. Hank Pym: That’s good. That’s very good, because this time you’re really going to have to learn how to control him. [we see the ants pushing sugar cubes on the table] Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.
[we see Hope and Scott fight training, this time Scott lands a painful blow to Hope]

Scott Lang: Oh, you okay, d… [Hope suddenly punches Scott in the face and then knocks him down with her legs]
[later as Scott is tending to his wound]

Hope van Dyne: Hank wants you outside for target practice.
Dr. Hank Pym: The suit has no weapons so I made you these discs. Red shrinks. Blue enlarges.
Hope van Dyne: [referring to another species of ant] Solenopsis mandibularis.
Dr. Hank Pym: Known for their bite, the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects. They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places.
[back to Scott trying to get some ants to put the sugar cubes into the teacup]

Dr. Hank Pym: You can do it Scott, come on. [one of the ants flies off and Scott takes off his earpiece in frustration]
Scott Lang: They’re not listening to me.
Hope van Dyne: You have to commit, you have to mean it. No shortcuts, no lies.
Dr. Hank Pym: Throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good, Hope.
Hope van Dyne: We don’t have time for coddling.
Dr. Hank Pym: Our focus should be on helping Scott!
Hope van Dyne: Really? Is that where our focus should be? [Hope picks up the earpiece and uses it to instruct the ants to put the sugar cube into the teacup, then she gets a herd of ants to appear]
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope! [looking upset Hope walks over to Pym]
Hope van Dyne: I don’t know why I came to you in the first place. [Hope leaves]
Dr. Hank Pym: We can’t do this without her.
[as Hope is about to leave in her car Scott gets in]

Hope van Dyne: Oh, God.
Scott Lang: You gotta lock your doors. I mean, really. There’s some weird folks in this neighborhood.
Hope van Dyne: Do you think this is a joke? Do you have any idea what he’s asking you to risk? You have a daughter.
Scott Lang: I’m doing this for her.
Hope van Dyne: You know when my mother died I didn’t see him for two weeks?
Scott Lang: He was in grief.
Hope van Dyne: Yeah, so was I, and I was seven. And he never came back, not in any way that counted. He just sent me off to boarding school. You know, I thought, with all that’s at stake, just maybe we might have a chance at making peace. But even now he still wants to shut me out.
Scott Lang: He doesn’t want to shut you out. He trusts you.
Hope van Dyne: Then why are you here?
Scott Lang: It proves that he loves you. Hope. Look at me. I’m expendable, that’s why I’m here. You must’ve realized that by now. I mean, that’s why I’m in the suit and you’re not. He’d rather lose than fight than lose you. Anyway… [Scott goes to get out of the car]
Hope van Dyne: You know, I didn’t know you had a… a daughter when I called the cops on you. What’s her name?
Scott Lang: Cassie.
Hope van Dyne: It’s a pretty name. You have to clear your mind, Scott. You have to make your thoughts precise, that’s how it works. Think about Cassie, about how badly you want to see her, and use that to focus. [she gives Scott the earpiece back to talk to the ants and places a coin on the dashboard] Open your eyes and just think about what you want the ants to do. [couple of ants arrive and Scott gets them to pick up the coin] That’s good. [they watch as Scott gets the ants to spin the coin]
[Hope and Scott enter back into the house where Pym is waiting]

Dr. Hank Pym: Your mother convinced me to let her join me on my missions. They called her the Wasp. She was born to it. And there’s not a day that goes by that I don’t regret having said yes. It was 1987, separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk and launched an ICBM at the United States. The only way to the internal mechanics was through solid titanium.
[in flashback we see Pym in his Ant-Man suit and his wife in her Wasp suit intercepted the missile]

Dr. Hank Pym: I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile, but my regulator had sustained too much damage. Your mother, she didn’t hesitate.
[we see Janet shrinking herself to stop the missile]

Dr. Hank Pym: Janet! No!
[flash-forward]

Dr. Hank Pym: She turned off her regulator and went sub-atomic to deactivate the bomb. She was gone. Your mom died a hero. And I spent the next ten years trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.
Hope van Dyne: You were trying to bring her back.
Dr. Hank Pym: But all I learned was we know nothing.
Hope van Dyne: It’s not your fault. She made her choice. But why didn’t you tell me this sooner?
Dr. Hank Pym: I was trying to protect you. I lost your mother. I didn’t mean to lose you too. [Hope begins to cry]
Hope van Dyne: I’m sorry.
Scott Lang: This is awesome. It’s awesome, you know? You guys are breaking down walls, you’re healing. It’s important. [Hope and Pym turn to look at him] I ruined the moment didn’t I?
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes, you did, yes.
Scott Lang: I’m gonna make some tea. [Scott turns and leaves]
[we see Scott finally shrink down and dive through the keyhole]

Scott Lang: Nailed it!
[he then goes under the earth, gets to fly on an ant]

Scott Lang: That’s a good boy, Ant-thony.
[we see him successfully work with the ants getting them to follow him]

Scott Lang: The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.
[we see Scott in his shrunken form on the side of a plane]

Scott Lang: It’s freezing! You couldn’t make a suit with a flannel lining?
[back in Pym’s lab]

Dr. Hank Pym: We must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy, it’s a device that I invented from my SHIELD days.
Hope van Dyne: We need it to counteract the transmission blockers that Cross installed in the Futures vault.
Dr. Hank Pym: It’s currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark’s old storage facilities in upstate New York. Should be a piece of cake.
[back to plane]

Scott Lang: You’re over the target area. Disengage, now, Scott.
[back on the plane Scott instructs the ants]

Scott Lang: Squadron A, go. B, go. C, go. Alright, Ant-thony, please don’t drop me this time. [they jump off the plane] Ah, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this.
Dr. Hank Pym: Stay calm.
Scott Lang: [approaching the "old Stark warehouse" he's supposed to burglarize] Uh, guys, we might have a problem. Hank, didn’t you say this was some old warehouse? [The "warehouse" comes into clearer view, with a large circle-A insignia on the roof denoting its role as the Avengers' base] It’s not! [we see that the warehouse is the new Avengers base] You son of a bitch!
Hope van Dyne: Scott, get out of there.
Dr. Hank Pym: Abort! Abort now.
Scott Lang: No, it’s okay. It doesn’t look like anyone’s home. Ant-thony, get me to the roof.
Dr. Hank Pym: He’s gonna lose the suit.
Hope van Dyne: He’s gonna lose his life.
[Scott lands in the roof of the new Avengers base]

Scott Lang: Alright I’m on the roof of the target building.
Hope van Dyne: Somebody’s home, Scott. [just then Sam Wilson in his Falcon flies in]
Natasha Romanoff: [on Sam’s radio] What’s going on down there, Sam?
Scott Lang: It’s the Falcon!
Sam Wilson: [into his radio] I had a sensor trip but I’m not seeing anything. Wait a second.
Dr. Hank Pym: Abort, Scott! Abort now.
Scott Lang: It’s okay, he can’t see me.
Sam Wilson: I can see you.
Scott Lang: He can see me. [Scott enlarges himself back to normal size and waves to Falcon] Hi. I’m Scott.
[to Pym back in the lab as they listen to Scott]

Hope van Dyne: Did he just say “Hi I’m Scott?”
[back to Avengers HQ]

Sam Wilson: What are you doing here?
Scott Lang: First off, I’m a big fan.
Sam Wilson: Appreciate it. So who the hell are you?
Scott Lang: I’m Ant-Man. [Sam smiles] Ant-Man?
Scott Lang: What, you haven’t heard of me? No, you wouldn’t have heard of me.
Sam Wilson: You want to tell me what you want?
Scott Lang: I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology just for a few days, and then return it. I need it to save the world. You know how that is.
Sam Wilson: I know exactly how that is. [into his radio] Located the breach. Bringing him in.
Scott Lang: Sorry about this! [just as Sam goes to grab Scott he shrinks himself, hits Sam and runs off]
Dr. Hank Pym: What the hell are you doing? [Sam chases after Scott]
Sam Wilson: Breach is an adult male who has some sort of shrinking tech. [Sam flies in and lands to stamp on Scott but Scott manages to intercept it and fights off Sam]
Scot Lang: Sorry. Sorry about this. Sorry [Scott jumps around Sam while punching him]
Sam Wilson: That’s enough! [Sam punches Scott as he jumps at him]
Scott Lang: Ant-thony, a little help. [Ant-thony flies in, Scott jump on his back and they fly into a vent and Sam goes to find him]
Dr. Hank Pym: I’ve lost visual! [suddenly Sam bursts through one of the facility doors]
Sam Wilson: He’s inside my pack.
Scott Lang: Sorry. You seem like a really great guy. [they fight but Scott gets manages to disable Sam’s flight pack then flies off on Ant-thony; into his radio]
Sam Wilson: It’s really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.
[back to Pym house]

Dr. Hank Pym: That was completely irresponsible and dangerous! You jeopardized everything! [Scott takes Pym’s signal decoy out of his pocket and places it on the table]
Hope van Dyne: You got it. [Scott nods his head]
Dr. Hank Pym: Well done.
Scott Lang: Wait a minute. Did you just compliment me? He did, didn’t he?
Hope van Dyne: Kind of sounded like he did.
Dr. Hank Pym: I was good, wasn’t I?
Scott Lang: Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger, and didn’t die?
Dr. Hank Pym: Now let’s not dwell on the past. We gotta finish our planning. [Pym turns and leaves with the signal decoy]
Hope van Dyne: Don’t mind him. You did good. [Pym enters his living room to find Cross standing there]
Dr. Hank Pym: Darren. How the hell did you get in here? [Pym closes the door]
Darren Cross: You left the front door open, Hank. It’s official. You’re old. [Hope and Scott hear them from the kitchen]
Hope van Dyne: The plans! He will kill him. [back with Cross and Pym]
Dr. Hank Pym: Well to what do I owe this pleasure?
Darren Cross: I have good news.
Dr. Hank Pym: Really? What’s that?
Darren Cross: Pym Tech, the company you created, is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world. We’re anticipating fifteen billion in sales tomorrow alone. [Pym says nothing, at the same time Scott gets some ants to roll up their plans on the nearby table] You’re welcome. I know this is odd, but I’d like you to be there. This is my moment, I want you to see it.
Dr. Hank Pym: Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure. I’ll be there.
Darren Cross: What did you see in me?
Dr. Hank Pym: I don’t know what you mean.
Darren Cross: All those years ago, you picked me. What did you see?
Dr. Hank Pym: I saw myself.
Darren Cross: Then why did you push me away?
Dr. Hank Pym: Because I saw too much of myself. [Cross turns and leaves] [after Cross leaves]
Hope van Dyne: He knows, he’s baiting you! We have to call it off.
Dr. Hank Pym: We’re all taking risks.
Hope van Dyne: What if he saw me here?
Dr. Hank Pym: He didn’t. There’s no way.
Hope van Dyne: How do you know that? [just then Hope gets a call from Cross] Darren, hi.
Darren Cross: Hope, where are you right now?
Hope van Dyne: I’m at home, why?
Darren Cross: I just saw Hank. I still get nothing but contempt from him.
Hope van Dyne: Don’t let him rile you up, he’s just… he’s just a senile old man.
Darren Cross: We need to start everyone working around the clock, get the assembly line up and running. And I’m tripling security. Full sensors at all entrances, and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro mesh.
Hope van Dyne: Great. Good idea.
Darren Cross: Thank you, Hope. I’m so lucky to have you on my team.
Hope van Dyne: He’s tripling security, he’s lost his mind, and he’s on to you.
Dr. Hank Pym: But he is not on to you.
Hope van Dyne: He’s adding full body scanners to all entrances and closing exterior vents. How are we gonna get Scott inside?
Scott Lang: The water main. You can’t add security to a water main. The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it, that’s how I get in.
Hope van Dyne: Somebody would have to reach the building’s control center to change the water pressure. I mean, Hank and I will be beside Cross, how are we supposed to do that?
Scott Lang: So we expand our team. What do we need? A fake security guard on the inside to depressurize the water system, somebody else to hack into the power supply and kill the laser grid, and a getaway guy.
Dr. Hank Pym: No, no. No, no, no. Not those three wombats. No way.
[Hope provides three cups of coffee for Luis, Dave and Kurt]

Luis: Thank you for the coffee ma’am. It’s not too often that you rob a place, and then get welcomed back. Because we just robbed you!
Hope van Dyne: [to Scott] You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?
Luis: Two smoothie machines.
Hope van Dyne: Are you sure they can handle this?
Luis: Oh we can handle it, we’re professionals.
Dr. Hank Pym: You’ll forgive us if we’re not instilled with confidence.
Dave: Wait, everybody. Just kick back and relax a little bit, man. we know our business. We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn’t we?
Dr. Hank Pym: I let you.
Dave: Well, one could say that I let you let me.
Scott Lang: Look, it’s okay. They can handle this.
Luis: Yeah, we can handle it.
Scott Lang: You got their credentials?
Hope van Dyne: He’s in the system.
Luis: I’m in the system?
Dave: The system.
Luis: The system?
Dr. Hank Pym: Yeah. We’re doomed.
Scott Lang: Alright, there’s something you guys need to see.
[a little while later, as Pym is showing Luis, Dave and Kur their plans Scott walks in wearing the Ant-Man suit]

Luis: Damn! Whoa! That’s so cool, bro!
Scott Lang: Now look, this is gonna get weird, alright? It’s pretty freaky but it’s safe. There’s no reason to be scared.
Luis: Aw, no, no. Daddy don’t get scared.
Scott Lang: Really?
Luis: Yeah.
Scott Lang: Good. [Scott shrinks himself freaking out Luis, Dave and Kurt]
Luis: Oh!
Kurt: This is the work of the gypsies.
Dave: That’s… that’s… that’s witchcraft.
Luis: Oh, that’s amazing. That’s like some David Copperfield shit.
Dave: That’s some kind of wizardry.
Kurt: Sorcery!
Luis: Ahh! Ahh! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! [runs out of the room] Get off! Get off! Ahh! [Luis runs off trying to get Scott off his shoulder]
Scott Lang: I thought daddy didn’t get scared?
[Luis, Dave and Kurt have all fallen asleep on the couch]

Hope van Dyne: I gave them each half a Xanax and Hank explained the science of the suit to them. Fell right asleep.
Scott Lang: Hey, look. I want to thank you for…
Hope van Dyne: No, please don’t. We’re all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us. I’m just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.
Scott Lang: Hey. Thank you, you know, for that pep talk.
Hope van Dyne: You know, the honest truth is I actually went from despising you to almost liking you.
Scott Lang: You really should write poetry. [Hope laughs]
Hope van Dyne: Get some sleep, Scott. [Hope leaves]
[later that night Scott uses the Ant-Man suit to go and visit his daughter in her room as she sleeps] [outside Pym Technologies]

Scott Lang: Alright, just so we’re clear, everyone here knows their role, right? Dave?
Dave: Wheels on the ground.
Scott Lang: Kurt?
Kurt: Eyes in the sky.
Scott Lang: Luis?
Luis: Aw, man, you know it. You know what, I get to wear a uniform, that’s what’s up.
Scott Lang: Luis.
Luis: I’m sorry, I mean, I’m good, I’m good. I’m just excited, and plus you’re girlfriend’s really hot, so you know that makes me nervous too. [to Hope] And you are very beautiful, ma’am.
Dr. Hank Pym: Oh, my lord.
Scott Lang: She’s not my…
Luis: Hey, you know what? I was thinking of a tactic, like when I go undercover, like a whistling, you know I’m saying? To like, blend in.
Scott Lang: No, don’t whistle. No whistling. It’s not the Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.
[on the night of the charity event, Luis makes it in employed as a security guard, outside Dave and Kurt are in their van with Scott in the back dressed in his suit]

Kurt: We’re set.
Scott Lang: Wish me luck. [Scott gets out, shrinks himself as he goes through the water main]
Kurt: Utility is online.
[inside the building Luis starts whistling]

Alpha Guard: Hey. What are you doing?
Luis: Uh, boss-man said to secure the area. So, I’m securing.
Alpha Guard: I’m the boss.
Luis: Oh.
Alpha Guard: [into his radio] Utilities work room three… [Luis suddenly punches him, knocking him out unconscious and then lowers the water level]
Kurt: Water level is dropping.
[Scott floats along on the water with the ants through the pipes]

Kurt: Coming up on extraction pipe.
Scott Lang: I see it! [to the ants] Alright, come on. I gotta get up there. That’s it, that’s it, guys, yeah! [the ants help him climb up to the extraction pipe] That’s it, yeah. Yes! You got it! You got it, come on! [Scott makes it through one of the handwash sinks in the bathroom] Alright, let’s fly Ant-thony. [Scott and the ants fly off]
Kurt: The Ant-Man is in the building.
[as they see Pym pull up outside the building where the charity event is taking place]

Dave: Phshh. Got a Crown Vic right outside over there.
Kurt: This is problem?
Dave: Considering the Crown Vic’s the most commonly used car for under-cover cops, man. Yes, this is a problem. [inside the Crown Vic is Paxton and Gale]
Paxton: That’s Pym. [they get out to go after Pym]
Kurt: Oh, no.
[back with Scott and the ants]

Scott Lang: I’m employing the bullet ants. Hapanera-clamda-mana-merna. I don’t remember what it’s called but I feel bad for this guy. [using the ants Scott takes down one of the security guards with Luis also punching him]
Luis: See, that’s what I’m talkin’ bout. That’s what I call it, an unfortunate casualty, in a very serious operation, you know? [Hope then comes along and enters the room and places the signal decoy]
Kurt: Signal decoy in place. Mean pretty lady did good, Scott.
Dave: Looks like Pym’s getting arrested.
Kurt: Scott, we have problem.
Scott Lang: Problem? What’s the problem? [just then Dave gets out of the can]
Kurt: Dave! Dave, that’s not part of plan!
Dr. Hank Pym: [as Paxton and Gale are trying to arrest Pym] Listen to me, if I don’t get into this building people will die.
Gale: That’s awfully dramatic.
[Dave creates a diversion by stealing Paxton and Gale’s car]

Paxton: Are you kidding me?! [they run after Dave as he drives off in their car]
Kurt: Problem solved.
[inside the building Cross finds Hope]

Darren Cross: Well. How do I look? [they then find Pym as he enters the building] There he is. Just in time. Come on. [Cross takes them to vault where he’s keeping the Yellowjacket suit, and uses an eye scanner to open the door]
Computer: Twelve point verification.
Dr. Hank Pym: Little over the top, don’t you think, Darren?
Computer: Confirming authorization.
Darren Cross: No, you can never be too safe.
Computer: Access granted. [they enter the vault]
Dr. Hank Pym: I gotta hand it to you, Darren, you really did it.
Darren Cross: And you only know the half of it, Hank. [at the same time Carson arrives with his men]
[back to Scott and the ants]

Scott Lang: Arriving at second position. Alright, top speed, Ant-thony! Let’s go. [Scott and Ant-thony fly towards where the Yellowjacket suit is being kept] Proceeding to command position. [Scott jumps off Ant-thony] I’ll be right back, Ant-thony. Alright, guys, I’m in position. I’m going to signal the ants. [Paxton and Gale find their car dumped can crashed into a tree]
Paxton: No, no, no, no! [Dave gets back into the van with Kurt]
Dave: Did you see that? [he honks the musical horn which Paxton recognizes from Scott using it earlier]
[back to Scott instructing the ants]

Scott Lang: Assume formation. Alright you cute little crazies, let’s fry these servers. [the ants fry the servers and Scott jumps back onto Ant-thony] Let’s go get ‘em, buddy!
Kurt: Servers are fried. Data backup completely erased.
Scott Lang: Headed to the particle chamber.
[Carson and his men enters the vault where Cross is with Pym and Hope]

Mitchell Carson: Hello, Dr. Cross. My associates agree to your terms.
Darren Cross: Wonderful. [to Pym] They’re not what they were, they’re doing some interesting work. And I’m enjoying myself. You tried to hide your technology from me, and now it’s gonna blow up in your face. [suddenly Pym punches Cross in the face] Wow. Wow! I mean, I saw the punch coming a mile away but I just figured it’d be all pathetic and weak.
Dr. Hank Pym: Well you figured wrong.
[back outside Paxton and Gale walk over to Luis’s van]

Paxton: I know this van. [he bangs on the van door] Anybody home?
Dave: [to each other inside the van] Shh.
Kurt: Shh.
Dave: Shh!
Kurt: Shh!
Scott Lang: Alright, guys, I’m here. Setting the charges. [Scott set the explosives; to the ants] Great job, guys. I’ll take it from here. [Ant-thony sets Scott down] Good boy, Ant-thony. Final position. [to Kurt and Dave] Guys, how we lookin’ on that laser grid?
Kurt: Almost!
Dave: No, you’re not.
Kurt: I’m getting close!
Dave: No, you’re not. [Paxton keeps banging on Luis’s van door]
Paxton: San Francisco PD! Man in the van! I know you’re in there! [inside the van as they wait for the laser grid to be disabled]
Dave: Make it go faster.
Kurt: Dude, seriously!
Scott Lang: Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?
Kurt: It’s so close.
Paxton: [suddenly the van door opens, Paxton and Gale point their guns at Kurt and Dave] Freeze!
Dave: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute! there was a black guy that looked exactly like me who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van.
Paxton: Get out.
Dave: Take it easy!
Kurt: [Paxton pulls Kurt out of the van at the same time the laser grid is disabled; to Scott] Go! Go now! [Scott jumps to get to the Yellowjacket] Wait!
Scott Lang: What? What do you mean wait? [Kurt manages to struggle free from Paxton’s hold to press a button on his computer to fully disable the lasers and just as Scott goes to grab the suit it’s pulled away] What? What? [Cross sees Scott and taps on the glass]
Darren Cross: Hi, little guy. [to Pym] I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere, which begs the question, who is the new Ant-Man? Who is the man that my beloved mentor trusted even more than me? [pauses a moment] Scott Lang. The martyr, who took on the system and paid the price, losing his family and his only daughter in the process. Exactly your kind of guy, Hank. He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how, and then, he disappears magically, despite having no money to his name, and now he brings me the Ant-Man suit, the only thing that can rival my creation.
Dr. Hank Pym: Darren, don’t do this. If you sell to these men, it’s going to be chaos.
Darren Cross: I already have, and for twice the price, thanks to you. It’s not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility. Thankfully, word travels fast. Oh, I’ll sell them the Yellowjacket, but I’m keeping the particle to myself. They don’t run on diesel. If you want the fuel you’ll have to come to me. What do you call the only man who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world?
Dr. Hank Pym: The most powerful man in the world.
Darren Cross: You proud of me yet?
Dr. Hank Pym: You can stop this, Darren. It’s not too late.
Darren Cross: It’s been too late for a long time now. [one of the men in the chamber points their gun at Pym]
Hope van Dyne: Darren, what are you doing?
Darren Cross: He wasn’t any more capable of caring for you than he was for me.
Hope van Dyne: This is not who you are, it’s the particles altering your brain chemistry.
Darren Cross: [to the guy pointing a gun at Pym] Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You’re right, I have to be the one to do it. [he points a gun at Pym’s head, at the same time Hope takes out her weapon and points it at Cross]
Mitchell Carson: Here we go.
Hope van Dyne: Drop your gun.
Darren Cross: You know I came to the house the other night to kill him, but you were there.
Hope van Dyne: You’re sick and I can help you just put the gun down.
Darren Cross: I wasn’t ready to kill you then, but I think I am now!
Hope van Dyne: Drop your gun, now!
Darren Cross: You picked the wrong side, Hope. [just then Scott breaks out using the disc Pym gave him that turn things large, he starts fighting off the men in the chamber and Pym is shot in the chaos]
Hope van Dyne: Dad! [grabbing hold of the wounded Pym]
Scott Lang: Hank. No, no. Hank. Hank. Listen, you’re gonna be okay. Alright? You’re gonna be just fine. [Cross comes up behind Scott and points his gun at the back of Scott’s head]
Darren Cross: Take the suit off or I’ll blow your brains out and peel it off! [Scott instructs the ants to disable Cross’ gun and bite him, so he takes off and the same time Carson takes off with vial of Cross’ particles]
Paxton: [Luis sets off the alarm to the building; into his radio] We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech, request immediate backup.
Dave: [Paxton and Gale head off; to Kurt] Go, go, go! [Dave and Kurt get into the van and drive off]
Hope van Dyne: [inside the vault] Dad, can you move?
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes.
Scott Lang: We need to get him out of here.
Hope van Dyne: Go get that suit. [Scott takes off and tries to get away from the two guards shooting at him]
[Scott shrinks himself into the small building model of Cross of Tech to get away from the guards shooting at him, then Luis comes to the rescue and knocks out the guards]

Luis: Hey, Scotty. Hey, did I save your life? Scotty? Scotty? [Scott makes himself large again]
Scott Lang: Thank you, Luis.
Luis: Hey, are we the good guys?
Scott Lang: Yeah.
Luis: We’re the good guys, right?
Scott Lang: Yeah, we’re the good guys.
Luis: Feels kind of weird, you know?
Scott Lang: Yeah, but we’re not done yet. Get out of here before this place blows. [Scott shrinks himself and takes off]
Luis: [as Luis tries to leave the building he remembers the guard he knocked out earlier] Oh, dammit! That guy. [he opens the door and rushes to the guard who is tied up] Hey! We’re getting out of here! [back inside the vault Hope helps Pym sit up]
Hope van Dyne: The charges are set. We’ve got to find a way out of here and fast.
Dr. Hank Pym: Don’t worry. I’m not gonna die, and neither are you. [he holds up a keychain that looks like a tank] It’s not a keychain.
[outside]

Paxton: [into his radio] All the chaos in here! Multiple shots fired. [suddenly a tank bursts out through the building] And there’s a tank. [Luis then walks out of the building with the guard]
Luis: A little help. [someone takes hold of the guard, at the same time Hope helps Pym out of the tank] I got him. [Luis helps Pym]
Hope van Dyne: We need a doctor! [a medic comes over to help Pym]
[Cross is in his helicopter]

Darren Cross: Let’s go! [just as they are about to leave Cross sees a swarm of flung ants heading towards him with Scott on Ant-thony, Cross takes out a gun and starts shooting and one of the bullets hits Ant-thony]
Scott Lang: Ant-thony! [Scott falls onto another ant]
Darren Cross: Go! [the helicopter door is closed]
Scott Lang: You’re gonna regret that. [Cross’ helicopter takes off] [Paxton sees Luis as he gets into his van]
Paxton: Wait a minute! Get out of that van!
Luis: What?
Paxton: Get out of that van!
Luis: It’s too loud there’s a tank, I can’t hear you! [he closes the van door and Dave drives off]
Paxton: Hey! Hey! [Scott makes it into Cross’ helicopter and Cross starts shooting at him]
Darren Cross: Did you think you could stop the future with a heist?
Scott Lang: It was never just a heist! [Scott sets off charges set around Pym Technologies and Cross watches in shock as the whole building is destroyed] Put the gun down!
[Cross hits Scott and he falls out of the helicopter window back into his normal size] [Scott manages to get back into the helicopter but finds Cross wearing the Yellowjacket, they both shrink start fighting and fall into a briefcase which falls out of the helicopter]

Darren Cross: I’m gonna disintegrate you! [inside the briefcase they accidentally hit the cell phone]
Cell Phone: Playing “Disintegration” by The Cure. [“Disintegration” by The Cure starts playing as Scott and Cross continue to fight]]
[[Briefcase falls into a family’s pool, Scott and Cross blast out in a splash as they return to normal size]

Pool BBQ Dad: Call 911! [Scott and Cross continue to fight shrinking and growing until Scott swats Cross into a bug zapper]
Scott Lang: It’s okay. [the family runs off in fear]
[Paxton and Gale show up]

Gale: Police! Put your hands up!
Paxton: Get ‘em up! [Scott pulls up his helmet] Scott?
Scott Lang: Paxton, you have to listen to me- [as Scott goes to walk towards Paxton they taser him and falls down unconscious]
[as Paxton and Gale are driving Scott back to the police station Scott wakes up] Paxton, turn around, take me back.

Paxton: I’m taking you back, to prison.
Scott Lang: There’s something in that backyard that needs to be destroyed. In the bug zapper, it…
Paxton: [Paxton suddenly stops the car and turns to Scott] You need to desist right now! Your delusions are out of hand!
Police Radio: All units we have a 236 in progress at 840 Winter Street.
Scott Lang: It’s Cassie! [Paxton takes off towards his house]
[Cross is standing in Cassie’s room looking menacing]

Darren Cross: Don’t be scared. [Paxton pulls up outside his house]
Paxton: Maggie, what’s going on?
Maggie Lang: He’s got Cassie!
Paxton: Who’s got Cassie?
Maggie Lang: That thing, that thing! I don’t know what it… ! [back in Paxton’s car, Scott manages to put on his helmet, shrinks and takes off]
[Cross starts walking towards Cassie]

Cassie Lang: Are you a monster?
Darren Cross: Do I look like a monster?
Cassie Lang: I want my daddy!
Darren Cross: I want your daddy too. [he picks up Cassie and she screams, just then Scott shows up] There you are.
Cassie Lang: Daddy, is that you? [Scott pulls up his helmet]
Scott Lang: Hi, Peanut. [to Cross] Why don’t you pick on someone your own size? [he throws a disc at Cross which shrinks him then he shrinks himself, Cross is now on the Thomas The Tank Engine toy in Cassie’s room]
Darren Cross: Now where did you go, little guy? [he spots Scott running towards him] There you are. [he starts firing lasers from his suit at Scott]
Scott Lang: Not just me. [a swarm of ants follow behind Scott] Get him! Go! Go! [Cross fights off the ants as they attack him, then Scott and Cross fight across the Thomas The Tank Engine toy]
Luis: [as they drive towards Paxton’s house] Scotty needs us, you know what I’m sayin’? Ain’t nothin’ gonna stop us. [they stop as they see a load of police cars and cops surrounding the house] Back it up. Back it up slow.
Dave: Yeah. [Dave starts to slowly back the van away]
Luis: Just back it up.
Dave: Yep, yep.
Luis: Back it up.
Dave: Okay.
Luis: All we gonna do is, we ju… we just back it up.
Dave: Okay. That’s it.
Luis: Back it up.
Dave: That’s right.
Luis: Back it up.
Dave: Yep.
Luis: Okay, now-now-now. Just back it up.
Darren Cross: [as they continue to fight in Cassie’s room inside the Thomas The Tank Engine railway] You insult me, Scott. Your very existence is insulting to me. [Cross shoots his laser at Scott as he runs around Cassie’s room] You know it would be much easier to hit you if you were bigger!
Scott Lang: Yeah, I agree. [Scott throws two discs at Cross, he deflects it one hitting an ant the other the Thomas The Tank Engine toy and they both grow large]
Paxton: Cassie! [Paxton runs into the house]
Darren Cross: I’m gonna show you just how insignificant you are. [Paxton goes to run up the stairs]
Paxton: Cassie, I’m coming! [suddenly the large ant heads his way, he falls down the stairs as the giant ant breaks out of the house]
Gale: That’s a messed-up looking dog.
Darren Cross: [back inside Cassie’s room; to Scott] I’m going to destroy everything you love! [Paxton shows up]
Paxton: Freeze! S.F.P.D.! [Cross throws Paxton’s gun aside, at the same time Scott climbs up the back of Cross’ suit]
Scott Lang: I can’t break through!
Darren Cross: It’s titanium, you idiot!
Scott Lang: [to Paxton as Scott and Paxton continue fighting] Get her out of here! [Paxton carries Cassie off]
Paxton: Come on.
Darren Cross: [as Paxton goes to leave the room with Cassie in his arms Cross stops them] Sorry, sweetheart. You have to help daddy pay for his mistakes.
Paxton: You stay behind me, okay?
Cassie Lang: Okay.
Paxton: Behind me. [Scott looks up at Cross’ particle pack]
Scott Lang: I’m gonna have to shrink between the molecules to get in there. [to Cross] Get away from us! Daddy, help! [Scott jumps up to head towards Cross’ particle pack] I love you, Cassie. [Scott shrinks to a small enough size to break into Cross’ particle pack, this causes Cross and Scott to go subatomic and disappear]
Cassie Lang: Daddy, where are you? [Scott floats past dust, viruses, molecules, atoms, hadrons, quarks, and finally the deepest parts of gluons and remembers Pym’s words]
Dr. Hank Pym: [voice] Go sub-atomic… go sub-atomic… [Scott tries to grow himself back to normal size but realized he can’t]
Scott Lang: Oh, no. [he continues to float in the quantum realm]
Dr. Hank Pym: [voice] You would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant. And as you shrink for all eternity, everything that you know and love gone forever. [Scott hears Cassie’s voice echoing as he floats in the quantum realm]
Cassie Lang: [voice] Daddy! Where are you? Daddy!
Scott Lang: Cassie.
Cassie Lang: [voice] Come on, daddy. [Scott remembers the discs Pym had given him and takes one out]
Dr. Hank Pym: [voice] Do not mess with the regulator. [Scott places the disc in the regulator, presses the button and finally returns to normal size] I love you so much.
Scott Lang: I love you too, so much.
Paxton: [as Scott is holding onto Cassie Paxton mildly gets Scott’s attention] There’s a big hole in the roof.
Scott Lang: Sorry. [Gale runs up to Cassie’s room and we see Paxton holding Cassie and Scott has gone]
Gale: Is she alright?
Paxton: She’s fine. [Maggie enters the room]
Cassie Lang: Mommy. [Maggie grabs hold of Cassie with relief]
Paxton: She’s fine, she’s fine. [Cassie notices Scott in his shrunken size wave goodbye to her and leaves]
[the next day Scott is over at Pym’s house]

Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, please. You don’t remember anything?
Scott Lang: Hank, I… I don’t.
Dr. Hank Pym: There must be something else. Well I suppose the human mind just can’t comprehend the experience, but you made it. You went in and you got out, that’s amazing.
Hope van Dyne: Scott, I’ll walk you out.
Scott Lang: [to Pym] Get some rest. [Scott and Hope leave the room, Pym looks over to the photo of himself with his wife holding Hope when she was a baby]
Dr. Hank Pym: Is it possible? [Pym gets up to leave his room, as he opens the door he finds Hope and Scott kissing] When did this happen?
Hope van Dyne: Nothing’s happening.
Scott Lang: Whoa, hold on. Something’s kind of happening.
Dr. Hank Pym: Well if that’s the case… shoot me again.
Scott Lang: [looking at Hope] Yeah, I don’t know what you’re doing grabbing me and kissing me like that. I was a little surprised myself. I have to get somewhere. I’ll see you later, Hank. Really, Hope. [Scott turns to leave]
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott.
Scott Lang: Yeah?
Dr. Hank Pym: You’re full of shit.
Scott Lang: Oh, yeah.
[Scott is having dinner with Paxton, Maggie, and Cassie]

Paxton: Well, Scott I met with my Captain today, he wanted a report of the night that you got out of jail. Something happened with the cameras, circuits got fried, and… But I told him you were processed correctly.
Scott Lang: Really?
Paxton: Well, yeah. Can’t be sending Cassie’s dad back to jail on a technical glitch, right?
Scott Lang: Thank you, Paxton. I’m blown away. Thank you for everything you do for Cassie.
Paxton: Oh, well, that’s my pleasure. But no, no, this one, I… I did it for you.
Scott Lang: This is awkward.
Paxton: Yeah.
Cassie Lang: Yeah.
Scott Lang: I mean what do we even talk about after all of that?
Cassie Lang: Oh, I know.
Scott Lang: What?
Cassie Lang: I did my first cartwheel today.
Scott Lang: What?
Maggie Lang: Yeah. She has been practicing all week, but today was the magic day.
Paxton: I recorded it on my phone here. [Paxton shows Scott his recording of Cassie doing her first cartwheel]
Scott Lang: No, that can’t be Cassie. That’s not you.
Maggie Lang: Yeah, it is.
Cassie Lang: Yeah it is.
Scott Lang: This is a professional gymnast, there’s no way that’s you.
Paxton: Yeah, that’s her. [Cassie feeds the giant ant hiding under the table that had escaped during Scott and Cross’ fight]
Cassie Lang: Good, boy. [after watching the video of Cassie doing her cartwheel]
Scott Lang: Sweetie, that’s pretty amazing, Peanut. [just then Scott gets a call] Sorry. It’s work. [he answers the call] Yeah?
[Scott meets up with Luis, Dave and Kurt]

Scott Lang: Alright, here’s the deal. Just give me the facts.
Luis: Just the facts, only the facts.
Scott Lang: Breathe, focus, keep it simple.
Luis: No, no, no, no doubt, no doubt. Okay, so I’m at this art museum with my cousin Ignacio, right? And there was this, like, abstract expressionism exhibit, but you know me, I’m more like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right? But there was this one Rothko that was sublime, bro. Oh, my God…
Scott Lang: Luis.
Luis: Okay. Sorry, sorry. I’m ju… you know, uh, I just get excited and stuff. But anyway, anyway. When Ignacio tells me: “Yoh, I met this crazy fine writer chick at this spot last night. Like, fine, fine, crazy stupid fine.” And he goes up to the bartender and goes: “Look at the girl I’m with? You know what I’m sayin’? She’s crazy stupid fine, right?” [we see flashback to Ignacio meeting the girl and talking to the bartender who is in fact Stan Lee] And the bartender’s all like: “Yeah, crazy stupid fine.” So this writer chick tells Ignacio: “Yoh, I’m like a boss in the world of guerrilla journalism, and I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains. You know what I’m sayin’?” Ignacio’s like: “For real? And she’s like: Yeah. You know what, I can’t tell you who my contact is, because he works with the Avengers.”
Scott Lang: Oh, no.
Luis: Yeah, and this dude sounds like a bad-ass, man. Like he comes up to her and says… [we see flashback of the girl meting up with Sam Wilson in a park] “Yoh, I’m looking for this dude who’s no one seen, who’s flashing this fresh tack, who’s got, like, bomb moves, right? Who you got? She’s like: “Well, we got everything nowadays, we got a guy who jumps, we got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls. You gotta be more specific.” And he’s like: “I’m looking for a guy who shrinks.” And I’m like: “Damn!” [to Scott] I got all nervous cause I keep mad secrets for you, bro. So I asked Ignacio: “Did bad-ass tell the stupid fine writer chick to tell you to tell me because I’m tight with that man, that he’s looking for him?”
Scott Lang: And? What’d he say?
Luis: He said yes.
[mid-credit scene; Hank brings Hope down to his lab]

Dr. Hank Pym: There’s something I want to show you. I realized you can’t destroy power, all you can do is to make sure that it’s in the right hands. [he opens up a vault to reveal the prototype of the Wasp suit] This is an advanced prototype that your mother and I worked on together. She never got to use it, but now I realize that we were… we were working on it for you. [Hope looks at the suit in shock then back to Pym] Maybe it’s time we finished it. [Hope looks back at the suit and smiles]
Hope van Dyne: It’s about damn time.
[post-credits scene: Sam and Steve Rogers are in a garage with the Winter Soldier, his metal arm tightly clamped in a vise and a forlorn look on his face]

Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap! [Steve and Sam are in an underground room with they are holding Bucky Barnes with his metal arm trapped in a vice] This would have been a lot easier a week ago.
Steve Rogers: If we call Tony…
Sam Wilson: He won’t believe us.
Steve Rogers: Even if he did…
Sam Wilson: Who knows if the accords will let him help?
Steve Rogers: We’re on our own.
Sam Wilson: Maybe not. I know a guy.

EXT. BARTON HOME - DAY

CLOSE ON: A HOUSE-ARREST ANKLE BRACELET.

CLINT BARTON (O.S.)
Okay, you see where you’re going? 
Let’s work on how to get there.

Pan up to find...CLINT BARTON, with his daughter, LILA, 
coaching her as she notches an arrow in her bow.

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
Okay, good...tip down...bow arm 
out...three fingers-

LILA BARTON
Why three?

CLINT BARTON
‘Cause two’s not enough and four’s 
too much-

LAURA BARTON (O.S.)
You guys want mustard or mayo, or 
both? 

CLINT TURNS.  IN THE FIELD BEHIND THEM, his wife, LAURA 
BARTON sets up a picnic as COOPER and NATHANIEL play soccer.  

LILA BARTON
Who puts mayo on a hot dog?

CLINT BARTON
We’ll both have mustard, hon!
(to Lila)
Okay.  Draw back, deep breath...

She lets loose.  THUD!  HER ARROW HITS NEAR THE BULLS-EYE. 

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
Good job, Hawkeye.  Go get your 
arrow. 

LAURA BARTON (O.S.)
Enough murder practice!  Soup’s on!

CLINT BARTON
One sec, babe.  Be right there! 
We’re gonna kill some hot dogs. 
We’re hungry.

But when he turns back...LILA IS GONE.  The bow and arrow lie 
at his feet.  He stares.

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
Lila?  Babe, did you see Lila-

He turns to his wife, BUT SHE’S GONE.  So are the boys.  The 
soccer ball rolls to a stop near the picnic blanket.

NO ONE CAN BE SEEN FOR A HUNDRED YARDS IN ALL DIRECTIONS.

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
Guys?  Guys, come on...

Clint walks toward the field, dread growing.

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
Laura?

Clint breaks into a panicked run. 

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
LAURA!

CLINT MELTS DOWN, SPINNING AROUND, FRANTIC...

MARVEL FLIP

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

BLACKNESS.  

TITLE: “TWENTY-TWO DAYS LATER.”

Soon, THE BENATAR tumbles past, adrift...

INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - NIGHT

TONY STARK and NEBULA play table-top football.  She wins.

TONY
(offering his hand)
Good sport.  Have fun? 

Nebula studies his hand, confused.  Finally she shakes.

NEBULA
It was fun.

INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

Tony, thin and haggard, kneels in front of HIS BROKEN IRON 
MAN HELMET.  He hits a switch.  A light blinks.

TONY’S RECORDING: he stares directly into the “camera.”

TONY 
This thing on?  Hey, Ms. Potts.  
Pep.  If you find this recording, 
don’t post it on social media.  
It’s going to be a real tearjerker.

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

THE BENATAR sparks, adrift.

TONY (O.S.)
I don’t know if you’re ever going 
to see these.  I don’t even know if 
you’re still...God, I hope so.  
Today’s day twenty-one, no...twenty-
two.

INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK

NEBULA lasers shut Tony’s infected wound.

TONY (O.S.)
You know, if it wasn’t for the 
existential terror of staring into 
the literal void of space, I’d say 
I’m feeling a little better today.  
Infection’s run its course, thanks 
to the Blue Meanie back there.  
You’d like her.  She’s very 
practical.  And only a tiny bit 
sadistic.

INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK

TONY AND NEBULA MEND THE EMPTY FUEL CELLS UNDER THE FLOOR.

TONY (O.S.)
The fuel cells were cracked during 
battle, but we figured out a way to 
reverse the ion charge.  Bought 
ourselves about 48 hours of flight 
time.  Problem is that was 
about...49 hours ago.  

EXT. SPACE - NIGHT

FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE WATCH THE BENATAR DRIFT IN SPACE.

TONY (O.S.)
Which means, we’re dead in the 
water.  A thousand light years from 
the nearest 7-11.

INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK

Tony hands Nebula the last of A PURPLE POWDER.  She pushes it 
back to him.

TONY (O.S.)
Most of the quote-unquote ‘food’ 
and potable water ran out two weeks 
ago.

INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

Tony stands on the flight deck, one hand resting on the 
glass, staring into the unknown.

TONY
Pep, I know I said no more 
surprises.  But, I gotta say, I was 
really hoping to pull off one last 
one.  But it looks like...well, you 
know what it looks like. 

INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT

Back to now.  Tony records his thoughts into his helmet.

TONY
Don’t feel bad about this.  I mean, 
actually, if you grovel for a 
couple weeks, and then move on with 
enormous guilt...I should probably 
lie down for a minute, rest my 
eyes.  Please know, when I drift 
off, it will be like every day 
lately.  I’m fine, totally fine.  
I’m going to dream about you.  It’s 
always you. 

Tony switches the helmet off.

TIME CUT:

NEBULA finds TONY SPRAWLED ON THE FLOOR.

TIME CUT:

Nebula helps Tony into Quill’s chair.  Tony slumps, 
completely still.  Nebula gives him his privacy.  

Move in on Tony’s face as...A LIGHT SLOWLY GROWS BRIGHTER.  
Soon, the entire flight deck glows as bright as a sun.  

Nebula appears from the galley, shading her eyes.  Tony’s 
eyelids flutter.  Finally, he opens them to see...

CAPTAIN MARVEL (CAROL DANVERS) hovering in space. 

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, BATHROOM - NIGHT

STEVE ROGERS shaves.  

He studies himself in the mirror, exhausted.  He’s about to 
tap his razor in the sink’s standing water, when...

THE WATER RIPPLES.  Steve stares a beat, puzzled.  Then the 
lamp catches his eye...SWAYING GENTLY.

Just then, a sound roars overhead.  Steve turns...

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - NIGHT

THE MOON HANGS HUGE OVER THE EARTH.  Then the silhouette of 
THE BENATAR races past, propelled by CAROL DANVERS.

Below...STEVE ROGERS, BRUCE BANNER, AND NATASHA ROMANOV watch 
a flying woman guide the ship to the ground.

Behind them, PEPPER POTTS walks up to the group.

TIME CUT:

Steve races up as NEBULA helps Tony down the ramp.  

TONY
I couldn’t stop him.

STEVE
Neither could we.

TONY
I lost the kid.

STEVE
(unable to say it all)
We...lost...

TONY
Is Pepper...?

JUST THEN, PEPPER POTTS THROWS HERSELF INTO TONY’S ARMS.

PEPPER POTTS
Stay here, you stay right here-

TONY
I’m not going anywhere.

NEARBY, NEBULA watches the sad humans.  ROCKET SITS BESIDE 
HER, GRATEFUL.  She rests a hand on his furry head.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

RHODEY, TONY, STEVE, NATASHA, AND CAROL watch...

A HOLO-DISPLAY ROTATING THROUGH FACES OF PEOPLE WE’VE LOST: 
WANDA.  VISION.  BUCKY.  T’CHALLA.  MARIA HILL.  

RHODEY
It’s been twenty-three days since 
Thanos came to Earth.

TONY, weak, sits in a hi-tech wheelchair, IV dripping into 
his arm.  He stares, taking in the loss: 

SAM WILSON.  SECRETARY ROSS.  SHARON CARTER.  SCOTT LANG.  
HOPE VAN DYNE.  HANK PYM.  NICK FURY. 

At Fury, Carol bites back emotion.

NATASHA
World governments are in pieces, as 
you can imagine.  But the parts 
that still work are trying to take 
a census.  It looks like he did 
what he said he was going to do.

JANE FOSTER.  ERIK SELVIG.  WONG.  DR. STRANGE.  THE BARTON 
FAMILY.  QUILL.  DRAX.  MANTIS.  GROOT.  PETER PARKER.

Finally, Tony looks away.  RHODEY turns it off.  

NATASHA (CONT'D)
Thanos wiped out fifty percent of 
all the living creatures on Earth.

CAROL DANVERS
Not just Earth. 

RHODEY
You sure about that?

6


7

CAROL DANVERS
You never have to ask me that.

TONY
Where is he now?

STEVE
We don’t know.  He just opened a 
portal and walked through.  

Tony looks out to see...THOR on the patio.

TONY
What’s his deal? 

ROCKET (O.S.)
He’s pissed.

Tony turns to see Rocket for the first time.

ROCKET (CONT'D)
He thinks he failed.  Which, of 
course, he did.  But there’s a lot 
of that going around, ain’t there?

TONY
Until this second, I literally  
thought you were a Build-a-Bear.

STEVE
We’ve been hunting Thanos for three 
weeks - deep space scans, 
satellites - we got nothing.  Tony, 
you fought him-

TONY
Who told you that?  I didn’t fight 
him, he wiped my face with a planet 
while a Bleecker Street magician 
gave away the store.  There was no 
fight because he’s not beatable. 

STEVE
Did he give you anything to go on?  
Clues, coordinates-  

Tony stares, lost, barely acknowledging Steve.

TONY
I saw this coming, few years back. 
Didn’t wanna believe.  I thought I 
was dreaming...  

7


8

STEVE
Tony, I need you to focus-

TONY
And I needed you, as in past tense.  
That trumps what you need.  It’s  
too late, buddy.  You know what I 
need?

Tony turns to everyone, slightly unstable.  

TONY (CONT'D)
I need a shave and a burger, not a 
bowl of soup.
(stands)
And I believe I remember telling 
all of you, alive and otherwise, 
that we needed a suit of armor 
around the world, whether it 
impacted our precious freedoms or 
not-

STEVE
But that didn’t work out, did it?

TONY
I said we’d lose, you said we’d “do 
that together, too.”  Guess what, 
Cap, we lost, and you weren’t 
there.  But that’s what we do, 
right?  Our best work after the 
fact?  We’re the “Avengers”, not 
the “Pre-vengers-”

RHODEY
Tony, take it easy...

TONY
I’ve got nothing for ya, Cap.  No 
coordinates, no clues, no 
strategies, no options.  Zero, zip, 
nada.  No trust.
(rips out RT)
Here.  You take this.  You find 
him, you put this on, and hide.
(drops to his knees)
I’m fine!

Tony COLLAPSES.  Rhodey catches him.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CORRIDOR - DAY

CAROL, STEVE, AND NATASHA stare through GLASS DOORS at TONY 
IN A HOSPITAL BED, PEPPER AND BANNER AT HIS SIDE.  

RHODEY STEPS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL ROOM.

RHODEY
Bruce gave him a sedative.  Should 
be out the rest of the day.

CAROL DANVERS
(heading for the lab)
Take care of him.  When I come 
back, I’ll bring a bottle of 
Xorrian elixir.

STEVE
Where are you going?

CAROL DANVERS
To kill Thanos.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

NATASHA catches up to CAROL IN THE WORKSHOP.

NATASHA
Hey, hey, hang on.  We’re sort of a 
team here.  Between you and me, 
morale’s a little fragile.

CAROL DANVERS
Oh, I’m sorry.  My fault.

Carol sees Steve and Rhodey catch up.  She claps her hands.

CAROL DANVERS (CONT'D)
All right, team!  I’m going to go 
kill Thanos.  Message me if you get 
any intel that can help.  
Otherwise, I’ll report back when 
he’s dead.  Great work, everybody.  

STEVE
Look, we realize “up there’s” more 
your territory, but this is our 
fight, too. 

RHODEY
Do you even know where he is?

9


10

CAROL DANVERS
I know people who might-

NEBULA (O.S.)
Don’t bother.

They all turn to see NEBULA in THE LIVING AREA DOORWAY.

NEBULA (CONT'D)
I can tell you where Thanos is.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - DAY

STEVE, NATASHA, RHODEY, BANNER, ROCKET, THOR, and CAROL 
gather.  NEBULA studies her robotic hand.

NEBULA
Thanos spent a long time trying 
to...perfect me.  When he worked, 
he talked.  About his Great Plan.  
Even disassembled, I wanted to 
please him.  I’d ask, where would 
we go once his plan was complete?  
His answer was always the same: “To 
the Garden.”

RHODEY
You’re saying Thanos had a 
retirement plan.

STEVE
Where’s this garden?

ROCKET brings up EARTH on A HOLO-MAP.  A BRIGHT SURGE OF 
ENERGY ENVELOPS THE PLANET (EMANATING FROM WAKANDA).

ROCKET
When Thanos snapped his fingers, 
Earth become ground zero for a 
power surge of ridiculously cosmic 
proportions.  No one’s seen 
anything like it.

He shifts the map, crossing billions of light years, to...AN 
IDENTICAL SURGE ENVELOPING A MYSTERIOUS, ORANGE PLANET.

ROCKET (CONT'D)
Until two days ago.

NATASHA
You’re saying he snapped his 
fingers again.  Where?

10


11

Rocket zooms the holo-image toward a cluster of stars...

NEBULA
Planet is unnamed, but inhabitable.  
Rich atmosphere, good soil-

STEVE
A garden.

BRUCE BANNER
Thanos is there.  And he just used 
the stones.

Steve eyes everyone.  THOR FINALLY LOOKS UP.  

BRUCE BANNER (CONT'D)
(thinking of himself)
You know, we’d be going short-
handed.

RHODEY
Because he killed all our friends.

ROCKET
Are we saying they’re dead?  We’re 
using that word now?

RHODEY
He’s still got the stones.

CAROL DANVERS
So, we take them.  And we use them 
to bring everybody back.

BRUCE BANNER
Just like that?

STEVE
Yeah.  Just like that.

No one speaks.  Finally...

NATASHA
If there’s even the smallest chance 
we can undo this, then we owe it to 
everyone who’s not sitting here to 
try.

Everyone looks around the room...AGREED.

BRUCE BANNER
If we do this...why would it end 
any differently than it did before?

11


12

CAROL DANVERS
Because before you didn’t have me.

RHODEY
Hey, new girl.  All of us in here 
are about that superhero life.  
Where’ve you been all this time?

CAROL DANVERS
There’s a lot of people in the 
universe.  And they didn’t all have 
you.

THOR STANDS.  He crosses to Carol and holds out his hand.  
STORMBREAKER WHIPS PAST HER HEAD, RUFFLING HER HAIR.

Carol doesn’t flinch.  Thor smiles.

THOR
I like this one.

Steve stares at the planet a long, deciding moment.  Then...

STEVE
Let’s go get that son of a bitch.

SLAM TO:
TITLE: “AVENGERS: ENDGAME”

INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - DAWN

EVERYONE settles into their seats on the Benatar’s flight 
deck.  STEVE WATCHES EARTH GROW SMALLER THROUGH THE WINDOW. 

CAROL DANVERS
Trust me.  You get used to it.

ROCKET looks around from the pilot’s chair.

ROCKET
Okay, who here hasn’t been to 
space?

STEVE, NATASHA, and RHODEY half-raise their hands.

ROCKET (CONT'D)
Oh, you’re gonna hate this.

NEBULA
Approaching jump in three, two...

STEVE’S FINGERS TIGHTEN on the arm rest as...

12


13

EXT. BENATAR - DAWN

WHOOSH!  THE BENATAR WARPS, LEAPING INTO JUMP SPACE.

EXT. SPACE - DAY

WHOOSH!  THE BENATAR ARRIVES ABOVE AN OMINOUS, ORANGE PLANET.  
As the ship maintains orbit, CAROL flies toward the planet.

CAROL DANVERS
I’ll head down for recon.  If I’m 
not back in fifteen, you’ll know I 
found him.

INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - SPACE

OUR HEROES wait on the flight deck, tense.  

NATASHA looks at STEVE, who’s staring at...A COMPASS: PEGGY 
CARTER’S YELLOWED PHOTO STILL RESTS INSIDE. 

NATASHA
This is going to work, Steve.

STEVE
I know it will.  
(beat)
Because I don’t know what I’m going 
to do if it doesn’t.

JUST THEN, CAROL FLIES UP TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS.

CAROL DANVERS (OVER COM)
No satellites, no ships, no armies.  
No ground defenses of any kind.  
It’s just him.

NEBULA
That’s enough.

The Avengers exchange a look.

EXT. TITAN-2 - DAY

SMOKE CURLS FROM THE CHIMNEY OF A SOLITARY LODGE.

INT. THANOS’ LODGE - DAY

A POT BOILS OVER A FIRE.  Then...THANOS LIMPS TOWARD IT, LEFT 
SIDE PARALYZED, arm blackened.  A shell of his former self.

13


14

He stirs the pot.  Suddenly, AN ARMORED HAND BURSTS FROM THE 
FIRE, GRABBING THANOS’ GAUNTLET...

PREVENTING THANOS FROM CLOSING HIS FIST.

Thanos jerks back as HULKBUSTER SPRINGS INSIDE.  CAROL AND 
RHODEY BASH THROUGH THE ROOF, PINNING THANOS’ ARMS.  

THOR crashes through the door, followed by the others.  HE 
SWINGS STORMBREAKER...CUTTING OFF THANOS’ HAND. 

The Gauntlet lands at Rocket’s feet.  He picks it up...and 
his face goes slack.  He turns the glove toward the others.

And we now realize...THE INFINITY STONES ARE GONE.

STEVE
Where are they?

Thanos doesn’t answer.  CAROL PRESSES HIM TO HIS KNEES.

CAROL DANVERS
Answer the question!

THANOS
The universe required correction.  
After that, the stones served no 
purpose beyond temptation.

BRUCE BANNER
You murdered trillions.

THANOS
You should be grateful.

NATASHA
Where are the stones?

THANOS
Gone.  Reduced to atoms.  

BRUCE BANNER
You used them two days ago!

THANOS
I used the stones to destroy the 
stones.  It nearly killed me.
But the work is done.  It always 
will be. 

That lands, sickening.  ROCKET SEARCHES, FRANTIC, NEAR TEARS.

ROCKET
No...they can’t be gone...

14


15

RHODEY
He’s lying. 

NEBULA
My father is many things.  A liar 
is not one of them.

THANOS
Thank you, daughter.  Perhaps I’ve 
treated you-

SWOOSH.  THOR’S AXE SEVERS THANOS’ HEAD FROM HIS BODY.  IT 
HITS THE FLOOR, FOLLOWED BY THE THUD OF HIS HUGE FRAME. 

ROCKET
What did you do?

Thor just stares, his long journey a failure.  

THOR
I went for the head.

As Thor walks away, Steve looks at Thanos’ head on the 
ground.  IT’S OVER.  THEY LOST.

FADE TO BLACK.

OVER BLACK: “FIVE YEARS LATER.”

EXT. PORT OF NEW YORK - DAY

A CAR CRUSHER flattens an Audi.  THOUSANDS MORE NEVER-DRIVEN 
CARS LIE STACKED ON THE DOCKS, WAITING THEIR TURN.

EXT. NEW YORK - DAY

A HUGE TARP flaps over the shuttered LINCOLN CENTER.

EXT. SHEA STADIUM - DAY 

A TEENAGE GIRL rides her skateboard, alone in a weed-filled 
parking lot.  Pull back to see THE EMPTY STADIUM BEHIND HER.

INT. BROOKLYN COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT

A POSTER SHOWS A SINGLE FIGURE STARING AT A GROUP OF SHADOWS.  
IT READS, “WHERE DO WE GO, NOW THAT THEY’RE GONE?”

The bottom reads, “BROOKLYN SUPPORT GROUP, TUESDAYS 8PM.”

16

A GRIEVING MAN speaks in A RECOVERY GROUP.  

GRIEVING MAN
So, I went on a date the other day. 

JIMMY
Good job, Bobby.  Back in the game.

GRIEVING MAN
Thank you, Jimmy.
(to the group)
First in five years.  I sat there 
at dinner thinking, what are we 
even supposed to talk about? 

STEVE ROGERS, thinner, older, LISTENS INTENTLY.

STEVE
What did you talk about?

GRIEVING MAN
Same old crap.  How much things 
have changed.  How much we miss the 
Mets.  My job, his job.  Then it 
got kind of quiet.  He cried during 
the salads.

OLDER MAN 
What about you?

GRIEVING MAN
I cried just before dessert.  But 
I’m seeing him again tomorrow.  
So...

 STEVE
That’s great.  You’ve already done 
the hardest part.  You took a jump, 
didn’t know where you’d come down.  
And that’s it, those little brave 
baby steps we’ve gotta take.  To 
try to make us feel whole again, to 
find a purpose...
(to everyone)
I went into the ice right after I 
met the love of my life.  Woke up 
seventy years later and...had to 
keep going.

The group takes this in.

16


17

STEVE (CONT'D)
The world’s been left in our hands.  
If we don’t do something with 
it...then Thanos might as well have 
killed all of us.

People nod, but Steve seems unconvinced by his own words.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY

THE CAMERA ROTATES down from the sky onto a strangely quiet 
San Francisco, until it finds...A STORAGE WAREHOUSE.

INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, UNIT 277 - DAY

LUIS’ VAN sits in a storage unit, surrounded by boxes: “S. 
LANG, KITCHEN, S. LANG, CLOTHES.”

THROUGH THE VAN WINDOWS, we see...HANK PYM’S QUANTUM TUNNEL.  

A MEANDERING RAT CRAWLS ONTO THE CONTROLS.  IT ACCIDENTALLY 
STEPS ON A TOGGLE SWITCH and...A LIGHT GOES GREEN.  FLASH.

THE BACK DOORS OF THE VAN BLOW OPEN, revealing...SCOTT LANG,  
ANT-MAN suit shorting.  He retracts his helmet, gasping.

INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, SECURITY OFFICE - DAY

A GUARD reads THE TERMINAL BEACH, by J.G. Ballard.  He looks 
up at a monitor: SCOTT LANG holds up a sign, “HELP.”

EXT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE - DAY

A dented WAGON rolls over a speed-bump.  Scott, in his old 
clothes, slowly wheels his belongings away.  

The Guard watches him go, puzzled.

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, STREET - DAY

Scott walks A STREET OF ABANDONED HOMES.

SCOTT LANG
Hello?

He hears A CLACKING.  A KID on a bicycle rides by, playing 
card wedged between his spokes. 

Scott waves him down.  The kid stops.

17


18

SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
Hey.  Kid.  What happened here?

The kid says nothing.  He just stares at Scott with a haunted 
look.  Then he stands on his pedal and keeps riding.

CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK...

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY

STONE MONUMENTS loom in a park.  A small crowd mills.  Reveal 
Scott looking over the monuments, lost.

TIME CUT:

Scott walks up to the obelisks.  At the top, they read: “THE 
VANISHED.”  Hundreds of names line the stones.

He scans the “L’s,” finally finding, “SCOTT LANG.”

SCOTT LANG
What?
(realizing)
Cassie...

EXT. MAGGIE LANG’S HOUSE - DAY

A winded Scott races up the sidewalk toward his old house.  
He leaps a bush, banging on the front door.

SCOTT LANG
Cassie!  Cassie!

SOON, A TEEN GIRL opens the door, shocked.  A very long beat.

CASSIE LANG
Dad?

SCOTT LANG
Peanut?

Scott wraps his arms around CASSIE LANG (14), now five years 
older than when he last saw her.  She hugs him, CRYING. 

CASSIE LANG
I thought you were gone.

SCOTT LANG
I’m sorry.  I’m back...I’m 
back...I’m back...

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, FRONT GATE - DAWN

Avengers Compound stands amidst overgrown grass.  Rusty 
chains lock the gate.  

Faded signs warn: “RESTRICTED AREA.  KEEP OUT.” 

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - NIGHT

NATASHA SITS SURROUNDED BY HOLO-SCREENS FEATURING CAROL 
DANVERS, RHODEY, ROCKET AND NEBULA, AND OKOYE.

ROCKET (HOLO)
We boarded that “highly suspect 
warship” Danvers pinged.

NATASHA
And?

NEBULA (HOLO)
It was an infectious garbage scow.

ROCKET (HOLO)
So thanks for the hot tip-   

CAROL DANVERS (HOLO)
You were closer.

ROCKET (HOLO)
And now we smell like garbage-

NATASHA
(to Okoye)
You get a reading on those tremors?

OKOYE (HOLO)
Minor subduction in the African 
plate.

NATASHA
Do we have a visual?  How are you 
handling it?

OKOYE (HOLO)
Nat.  It was a mild earthquake.  In 
the ocean.  We handle it by not 
handling it.

Natasha looks burdened.  Rhodey steps in.

RHODEY (HOLO)
I can have NASA redirect a 
satellite, do a sweep just to make 
sure.

NATASHA
Thanks.  Carol, you’re still coming 
our way next month?

CAROL DANVERS (HOLO)
Not likely.

ROCKET (HOLO)
Getting another haircut?

CAROL DANVERS (HOLO)
Listen, fur-face, I’m covering a 
lot of territory out here.  The 
things that have been happening on 
Earth have been happening 
everywhere else.  On thousands of 
planets.  You might not see me for 
a long time.

NATASHA
All right.  Everybody keep keeping 
their eyes open.  This channel’s 
always active.  Anything goes 
sideways, anyone makes trouble 
where they shouldn’t, it comes 
through me.

They ad lib their goodbyes as they sign off, except Rhodey.

NATASHA (CONT'D)
What’s up?  Where are you?

RHODEY (HOLO)
Mexico.  Got some news. 

NATASHA
Okay...

RHODEY
Federalés found a room full of 
bodies outside Juarez.  Cartel 
guys.  Guns still in their pants.

NATASHA
Could be a rival hit-

RHODEY
But it wasn’t.  Same MO as 
Marseille.  And Kiev.

RHODEY (CONT'D)

21

(beat)
It’s definitely Barton.

She nods, grim, reluctantly accepting.

RHODEY (CONT'D)
What he’s done here...what he’s 
been doing...I got to tell you, 
part of me doesn’t want to find 
him.    

Natasha just stares a long beat.

NATASHA
Find out where’s he going next.

Rhodey nods, signing off.  Natasha sits there, THEN CRUMPLES.  

After a long beat...

STEVE (O.S.)
I’d offer to cook you dinner but 
you seem sad enough already.

Natasha turns to see STEVE in the doorway.

NATASHA
Come by to do your laundry?

STEVE
And see a friend.

NATASHA
Your friend’s fine.

STEVE
She leave the house today?

NATASHA
Nothing out there I particularly 
want to see.

STEVE
I spotted a pod of whales coming 
over the bridge.

NATASHA
(dubious)
In the Hudson.

STEVE
Fewer ships, cleaner water.  Just 
saying, there’s still a world out 
there. 

RHODEY (CONT'D)

21


22

NATASHA
If you’re about to tell me to look 
on the bright side, I’m about to 
hit you with a peanut butter 
sandwich.

Steve relents, LETTING DOWN HIS FACADE. 

STEVE
Sorry.  Force of habit.

NATASHA
I don’t know how you do it.

Steve bites into the uneaten half of her sandwich.

STEVE
I guess I don’t know how not to.

NATASHA
Me, neither.

After a long moment, Steve looks up at her, honest. 

STEVE
I keep telling them, move on.  Grow 
past it.  And some of them actually 
do.  But not us.  

NATASHA
If I move on, who does this?

STEVE
Maybe it doesn’t need to be done.

Natasha takes that in.  Steve is thinking of giving up.  She 
looks around at Avengers Compound.

NATASHA
I used to have nothing.  Then I got 
this.  This job, this family.  And 
I was better because of it.

She chokes slightly, collecting herself.

NATASHA (CONT'D)
And even though they’re gone, I’m 
still trying to be...better.  

STEVE
I think we both need to get a life.

NATASHA
You first.

22


23

They stare at each other a long, melancholy moment.

THEN, WE HEAR A PING.  NATASHA SWIPES TO A CCTV DISPLAY:  
SCOTT LANG’S FACE FILLS A SCREEN, LUIS’ VAN BEHIND HIM.  

SCOTT LANG (ON SCREEN)
Hello?  Is anyone home?  This is, 
uh, Scott Lang?  We met a few years 
ago.  At the airport?

STEVE
This an old message?

NATASHA
(stunned)
It’s the front gate.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - NIGHT

SCOTT paces, mumbling to himself. 

STEVE (O.S.)
Scott, are you okay?

SCOTT LANG
What?  Yes.

He turns to STEVE and NATASHA. 

SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
Have either of you guys ever 
studied quantum physics?

NATASHA
Only to make conversation.

Steve glances at her.  She shrugs.

SCOTT LANG
Well, five years ago, just before 
this Thanos guy...I went into a 
place called the Quantum Realm.  
It’s like its own microscopic 
universe.  You can only get there 
if you’re incredibly small.  Hope,  
she’s my...she was supposed to pull 
me out.  But then Thanos happened.  
And I was stuck in there.

NATASHA
I’m sorry.  It must’ve been a long 
five years.

23


24

SCOTT LANG
(getting excited)
Okay, but that’s the thing.  It 
wasn’t.  For me, it was only five 
hours.  The rules in the Quantum 
Realm aren’t like out here.  
They’re completely unpredictable. 
Is anybody gonna eat that sandwich?

STEVE
Scott, what are you talking about?  

SCOTT LANG
Time works differently in the 
Quantum Realm. 

Steve and Natasha share a look.

SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
Problem is, right now, it’s chaos, 
there’s no way to navigate it.  But 
what if we could figure out a way 
to enter the Quantum Realm at a 
certain point in time...and come 
out in another.  Like, before 
Thanos-

STEVE
Wait...wait.  Scott.  Are you 
talking about a time machine?

SCOTT LANG
No, not a machine.  More like a...
(searches, then gives up)
Yeah, like a time machine.  I know 
it sounds crazy...

NATASHA
Scott, I get emails from a raccoon.  
Nothing’s crazy anymore.

SCOTT LANG
So, who do we talk to about this?

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY

LLAMAS and FARM ANIMALS GRAZE A RUSTIC-TECH ECO-COMPOUND.

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, WOODS - DAY

TONY approaches A WOODED GLADE near the house.

24


25

TONY
Morgan H. Stark.  Chow time.  Want 
some lunch?

Silence.  Then MORGAN STARK (4) steps out of her play tent, 
wearing A PURPLE-BLUE IRON MAN HELMET (RESCUE).

MORGAN STARK
Define lunch or be disintegrated. 

TONY
You should not be wearing that.  
It’s part of a special anniversary 
gift I made for Mom.  You thinking 
about lunch?

Tony gently takes the helmet off, revealing A YOUNG GIRL.

TONY (CONT'D)
Where’d you find this?

MORGAN STARK
Garage.

Tony picks her up, walking toward the house.

TONY
You like going in the garage?  So 
does Daddy.  It’s all right.  Mommy 
never wears what I buy her.

TIME CUT:

Tony and Morgan exit the woods.  Suddenly, Tony stops.  

In the driveway, STEVE ROGERS stares at him.  NATASHA AND 
SCOTT GET OUT OF THE CAR BEHIND HIM.

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, PORCH - DAY

STEVE, SCOTT, and NATASHA sit with TONY.

TONY
I just want to thank you folks for 
dropping by.  It’s not every day 
one gets to contemplate biting it 
on an inter-dimensional timescape. 

NATASHA
You’ve got some objections to the 
plan.

25


26

TONY
So you’re calling it a plan.  To 
me, it sounds like an exotic 
suicide method.  Not to mention, 
it’s impossible. 

SCOTT LANG
We know what it sounds like.  

STEVE
Tony, after what you’ve seen, is 
anything really impossible?

TONY
Quantum fluctuation kinda messes 
with the Planck Scale, which then 
triggers the Deutsch Proposition, 
can we agree on that?  
(offering more tea)
Chai?
(back on message)
In layman’s terms, it means you can 
cancel your Netflix subscription 
because you’re not coming home.

SCOTT LANG
I did.

TONY
Which was a billion-to-one cosmic  
fluke.  Now you want to pull a-  
What are you calling it?

SCOTT LANG
A time heist.

TONY
Oh, of course, a time heist, why 
didn’t we think of this before?  
Right, because it’s a pipe dream.  
Who are you again? 

SCOTT LANG
Still Scott...

STEVE
Tony, the Stones exist in the past.  
We could get them and bring them 
here.  

NATASHA
We can snap our own fingers.  We 
can bring everybody back. 

26


27

TONY
Or screw it up worse than he 
already has.

STEVE
I don’t believe we would.

Tony stares at Steve, a lot of water under the bridge.

TONY
Gotta say it.  Sometimes I’ve 
missed that giddy optimism.  Sadly, 
all your high hopes won’t help me 
if there’s no logical, tangible way 
for me to safely execute said “time 
heist.”  I believe the most likely 
outcome would be our collective 
demise.

SCOTT LANG
Not if we strictly follow the rules 
of time travel.  No talking to our 
past selves.  No betting on 
sporting events-

TONY
Stop, Scott.  Stop.  Are you 
telling me that your plan to save 
the universe is more than loosely 
based on Back to the Future?

SCOTT LANG
(meaning “yes”)
No...

TONY
Good.  Because that would be 
horseshit.  Scientifically 
speaking, your brother’s picture 
doesn’t disappear just ‘cause you 
went to the dance with your mom. 
That’s not how quantum physics 
works.

NATASHA
We have to take a stand.  

TONY
We did stand.  And yet here we are.  

SCOTT LANG
Look, Stark-  Can I call you Tony?

27


28

TONY
Please don’t-

SCOTT LANG
Tony-

TONY
Fine.

SCOTT LANG
I get that you’ve got a lot on the 
line, here.  You’ve got a wife.  A 
daughter.  But I lost someone very 
important - a lot of us did - and 
now we have a chance to save her, 
and everyone else, and you won’t 
even- 

TONY
No, Scott.  I won’t.  Even.   

Suddenly, MORGAN walks onto the porch.

MORGAN STARK
Mommy told me to come save you.

Tony takes Morgan into his arms and heads inside. 

TONY
Good job.  I’m saved.
(to Steve)
I wish you were coming here to ask 
me something else.  I’m honestly 
happy to see you.  If you want to 
stay-

Steve tries one last time.

STEVE
Tony, I get it.  And I’m happy for 
you.  I am.  But this is a second 
chance.

TONY
Yeah, well, I got my second chance 
right here.  I can’t roll the dice 
on it.  The table is set for six.  
If you don’t talk shop, you’re 
welcome to stay for lunch.

He exits. 

28


29

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND - DAY

Steve, Natasha, and Scott walk toward the car.

NATASHA
He’s scared.

STEVE
He’s not wrong.

SCOTT LANG
What are we gonna do?  We need him. 
You want to stop?

STEVE
No.  I want to do it right.  
(beat)
We’re going to need a really big 
brain.

SCOTT LANG
Bigger than his?

EXT. DINER - NIGHT

ONLOOKERS crowd a diner window, trying to peek inside.

SCOTT LANG (O.S.)
I’m confused.

INT. DINER - NIGHT

SMART HULK ROLLS UP A PIZZA AND EATS IT LIKE A BURRITO. 
SCOTT, STEVE, AND NATASHA SIT ACROSS FROM HIM.  

SMART HULK
These are confusing times.

SCOTT LANG
No, that’s not what I’m-

SMART HULK
I’m kidding, I get it.  It’s crazy.  
I wear shirts now!

SCOTT LANG
But why?

SMART HULK
Five years ago, we got our asses 
kicked, right?

29

---


30

Smart Hulk eats a stack of pancakes in two bites.

STEVE
He’s heard.

SMART HULK
It was worse for me.  Because I 
lost twice.  First Hulk lost.  Then 
Banner lost.  Then we all lost.

NATASHA
No one blamed you, Bruce.

SMART HULK
I did-  I feel like I’m the only 
one eating.  Here, try some.

He holds out a pizza.  They decline.  He shrugs.

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Thing is, I kept thinking, it 
didn’t have to be that way.  That 
the best of Banner and best of 
Hulk, if they’d worked together, 
maybe they could’ve stopped Thanos.  

SCOTT LANG
Okay.  But how did...this happen?

SMART HULK
For years I treated the Hulk like a 
disease, something to get rid of.  
But when I started treating him 
like the cure...

Smart Hulk MESHES HIS FINGERS together.

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Eighteen months in the Gamma Lab.  
I put the brains and the brawn 
together.  And now look at me.  
Best of both worlds.

TWO KIDS amble up to the booth.

KID
Mr. Hulk?  Can we get a picture?

SMART HULK
100%, little lady.

The kid hands a phone to Steve.  SMART HULK makes a duck face 
as Steve sheepishly snaps the pic, handing the phone back.

30


31

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
(to the fan)
Thanks, pal.  Hulk out!

STEVE
So, Bruce, about what we said-

SMART HULK
The time travel do-over?  I don’t 
know, that’s kind of outside my 
field of expertise...

Natasha nods at his Smart Hulk-ness, history between them.

NATASHA
You pulled this off.  I remember a 
time that was impossible, too.

He considers, then finally relents, pulling out his phone.

SMART HULK
I’m supposed to be on Oprah next 
week, but I guess I could move 
things around.

INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, KITCHEN - NIGHT

TONY STARK DOES DISHES.  He rinses with the sprayer.  It goes 
everywhere.  He wipes down the counter, including...

A PICTURE OF PETER PARKER.  He stares.

INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, SIDE PORCH - NIGHT

Tony builds HOLO MODELS: Penrose diagrams, wormholes.  He 
studies a STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR, intrigued.

TONY
Friday, you up? 

FRIDAY
Yes, sir. 

TONY
I’ve had a mild inspiration, like 
to see if it checks out.  I would 
like to run one last sim before we 
pack it in for the night.  This 
time, in the shape of a Mobius 
Strip, inverted.

31


32

FRIDAY
Processing.

The model forms.

TONY
All right, give me the eigenvalue 
of that particle, factoring in 
spectral decomp.  Run it.  That’ll 
take a second.  And don’t worry if 
it doesn’t pan out, I’m just kind 
of...

THE CAPACITOR GLOWS.  A HOLO-MAN DRIFTS INTO A CIRCULAR 
WORMHOLE, LOOPING...RETURNING TO THE PLACE IT FIRST LEFT.  

FRIDAY
Model rendered.

TONY
(in awe)
Shit.

MORGAN STARK (O.S.)
Shit.

Tony turns to see HIS DAUGHTER in the doorway.

TONY
What are you doing up?

MORGAN STARK
Shit.

TONY
First of all, that’s a Mommy word, 
she coined it.  

MORGAN STARK
Why are you up?

TONY
I just had something on my mind.

MORGAN STARK
Was it juice pops?

TONY
Correct.  Great minds think alike. 
What kind do you want?

32


33

INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, MORGAN’S ROOM - NIGHT

Morgan eats A JUICE POP in bed.  Tony watches.

TONY
You done?  
(finishing her popsicle)
Now you are. 

MORGAN STARK
Tell me a story.

TONY
Once upon a time, Maguna went to 
bed.  The end.

MORGAN STARK
That was a bad story.

He runs his hand over her hair.

TONY
Love you tons.

MORGAN STARK
Love you three thousand.

TONY
Wow, that’s a lot. 

Tony turns out the light, exits.

INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

PHOTOS crowd a side table: Pepper, Morgan, Tony.  Even one of 
HOWARD STARK, PEGGY CARTER & HANK PYM UNDER A SHIELD SYMBOL.  

Find...PEPPER, curled up on the couch reading.  Then... 

TONY (O.S.)
Out like a light.  Don’t know how 
much she loves you but she loves me 
three thousand.

PEPPER POTTS
That’s up there.

TONY
What’re you reading?

PEPPER POTTS
A book about composting-

33


34

TONY
I think I solved it.

Pepper looks up.

PEPPER POTTS
Just so we’re both talking about 
the same thing-

TONY
Time travel.

PEPPER POTTS
That’s amazing.

TONY
Yeah.  

PEPPER POTTS
And terrifying.  

TONY
To say the least.

He sits beside her.  She stares, SHARING IN HIS DILEMMA.

PEPPER POTTS
We got really lucky-  

TONY
I know-

PEPPER POTTS
Not everybody did.

TONY
I can’t help everybody.

PEPPER POTTS
Except, it sort of seems like you 
can.

TONY
Not if I stopped right here.  

PEPPER POTTS
Tony, trying to get you to stop is 
one of the few failures of my life.

TONY
I could just lock the lab, put it 
in a trunk, sink it to the bottom 
of the lake, and go to bed.

34


35

PEPPER POTTS
But could you rest?

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

SCOTT WAITS IN HIS ANT-MAN 2 QUANTUM SUIT IN FRONT OF THE 
OPEN VAN DOORS.  

SCOTT LANG
You’re sure these modifications are 
safe?

He looks over to...SMART HULK, WEARING READING GLASSES, 
MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO A NEW CONTROL PANEL.  

SMART HULK
I reran my calculations three times-

SCOTT LANG
Because the guy who invented this 
thing is pretty much a genius-

SMART HULK
I have seven PhD’s, an MD, the Hans 
Bethe Award for Physics, and I’m 
personal friends with Bill Nye the 
Science Guy.  We’re good. 

SCOTT LANG
Yeah.  And you look like that on 
purpose.

STEVE and NATASHA enter from outside.

STEVE
Breakers are set, emergency 
generator’s on stand-by.

SMART HULK
Good.  If we blow the grid, I don’t 
want to lose Tiny back in the 
‘50’s.

SCOTT LANG
Excuse me?

NATASHA
He was kidding.

SMART HULK
I was kidding.

35


36

NATASHA
(to Hulk)
You were kidding, right?

SMART HULK
Honestly, I have no idea.  We’re 
attempting time travel.  Either 
it’s all a joke, or none of it is.
(loudly to Scott)
We’re good!  Helmet on.

Scott puts on his helmet, slightly dubious.

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Okay.  I’m going to send you back 
one week, give you an hour to look 
around, then bring you back in ten 
seconds.  Make sense?  

SCOTT LANG
Perfectly not confusing.

STEVE
Good luck, Scott.  You’ve got this.

SCOTT LANG
(inspired)
Yes, I do, Captain America.  Yes, I-

SMART HULK PULLS A LEVER.  SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING. 

SMART HULK
Counting down from three, two, 
one...

SUDDENLY SCOTT REAPPEARS...BUT HE’S 12-YEARS-OLD.

SCOTT LANG
Uh, guys?  This doesn’t feel right.

NATASHA
Is that Scott?

SMART HULK
Probably...?

He scrambles, hitting buttons.  SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING.

STEVE
Get him back!

Smart Hulk flips a switch.  SCOTT REAPPEARS...AT AGE 93.

36


37

SCOTT LANG
Oh, my back!

NATASHA
Bruce!  Get it under control.  What 
the hell is going on? 

SMART HULK
I got it, I know exactly what’s 
going on.  Pretty much.

SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING AGAIN.  HULK TYPES FRANTICALLY with 
A PENCIL, fingers too big for the keys.

2-YEAR OLD SCOTT APPEARS.

NATASHA
Oh, my God.

STEVE
It’s a baby.

SMART HULK
It’s Scott.

STEVE
As a baby!

Smart Hulk hits a button.  Baby Scott disappears.

SMART HULK
When I tell you, kill the power!
(throwing a switch)
Now!

NATASHA KILLS THE POWER.  Normal Scott stumbles off the pad.

SCOTT LANG
Somebody peed my pants.  I don’t 
know if it was baby-me or old-me. 
Or just me-me.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

Steve leans on the wall, discouraged.  Then he hears AN 
ENGINE ROAR.  AN AUDI races up the drive.  

It stops, the window rolling down to reveal...TONY.

TONY
Why the long face?  Wild guess, he 
turned into a baby?

37


38

STEVE
Among other things.

TONY
(getting out of the car)
EPR Paradox.  Instead of pushing 
Lang through time, you were pushing 
time through Lang.  It’s dangerous.  
I probably should’ve cautioned you 
against it.

STEVE
You did.

TONY
Thank god, I’m here.  Regardless, I 
fixed it.

He holds up...HIS STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR.

TONY (CONT'D)
That is a fully-functioning, time-
space GPS.  I just want peace. 
Resentment is corrosive.  I hate 
it. 

STEVE
Me, too.

Something eases between them, for the first time in years.

TONY
We’ve got a shot at the Stones.  I 
just need you to know my 
priorities.  Bring back everyone we 
lost, hopefully.  Keep what I 
found, definitely.  And, let’s not 
die trying. 

Steve looks at Tony.  Finally, he offers his hand.

STEVE
Sounds like a deal.

They shake.  This is a long time coming.  Finally...

TONY
But wait, there’s more.   Act now, 
and it comes with a bonus offer.

Tony pops the trunk.  Steve stares, moved, at...HIS SHIELD.  

STEVE
Tony, I don’t know-

38


39

TONY
What’s to know?  He made it for 
you.  Plus, I gotta get it out of 
the garage before Morgan takes it 
sledding. 

Steve finally picks up the shield, SLIDING IT ONTO HIS ARM.

STEVE
Thank you, Tony. 

Tony chokes up, then covers by slamming the trunk.

TONY
Just don’t flaunt it.  I didn’t 
bring enough for the whole team.
We are getting the whole team, 
right?

STEVE
We’re trying.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

SCOTT sits on a bench, eating a hardshell taco.  THEN A 
MASSIVE EXHAUST WIND BLASTS HIM, blowing his taco away.

THE BENATAR lands outside AVENGERS COMPOUND.  NEBULA AND 
ROCKET EMERGE.  Rocket waits at the end of the gangway.

ROCKET
Hey, Humie.  Where’s Big Green?

SCOTT LANG
Um, kitchen, I think.

Scott tries a smile at Nebula.  She just hits her COM:

NEBULA (INTO COM)
Rhodey, careful on re-entry.  
There’s an idiot in the landing 
zone.

She goes in.  THEN, WHAM, WAR MACHINE LANDS, STARTLING SCOTT. 

SCOTT LANG
Oh, my God!

RHODEY
What’s up, Regular-Sized Man?

Rhodey goes inside as SMART HULK walks out, carrying an 
overnight bag.  He hands Scott some tacos.

39


40

ROCKET
Finally.  I ain’t got all day.

SMART HULK
I call shotgun!

As he walks up the Benatar’s gangway, PRE-LAP A METALLIC 
SCRAPING SOUND.

EXT. NEW ASGARD - DAY

The scraping goes on as we see...A NORWEGIAN FISHING VILLAGE.  
Tilt to a sign: “NEW ASGARD,” in English and ASGARDIAN RUNES. 

A PICK-UP passes, scraping the pavement: SMART HULK AND 
ROCKET SIT IN BACK, WEIGHING DOWN THE TRUCK.

EXT. NEW ASGARD, VILLAGE - DAY

SMART HULK AND ROCKET WALK THROUGH TOWN.  ASGARDIANS IN 
EARTHLY CLOTHES EYE THEM WITH SUSPICION.

ROCKET
What the heck are they looking at?

SMART HULK
I’m kind of famous...

ROCKET
Yeah, I’m sure that’s it.  Kind of 
a step down from golden palaces and 
magic hammers...

SMART HULK
They lost Asgard, then half their 
people.  Maybe they’re just happy 
to have a home.

VALKYRIE (O.S.)
You shouldn’t have come.

VALKYRIE approaches from the pier.  Smart Hulk GRINS.

SMART HULK
Hey, Valkyrie!  Great to see you!

He goes for a hug...VAL DOESN’T.  She studies the new him.

VALKYRIE
Uh huh.  I liked you better either 
of the other ways.

40


41

SMART HULK
This is Rocket.

ROCKET
Hey.

VALKYRIE
Hey.
(to both)
He won’t see you.

SMART HULK
We didn’t say we were here to see-

VALKYRIE
Great, then you can hose out the 
gut buckets-

ROCKET
We’re definitely here to see him.

VALKYRIE
He can’t give you what you need.

SMART HULK
It’s that bad?

VALKYRIE
We only see him once a month.  When 
he comes in for “supplies.”

She nods to A DOZEN BEER KEGS STACKED OUTSIDE A PUB.

EXT. NEW ASGARD, CABIN - DAY

Smart Hulk and Rocket knock on the door of A CABIN.  Nothing.

INT. NEW ASGARD, CABIN - DAY

SMART HULK opens the door.  PIZZA BOXES and LIQUOR BOTTLES 
litter the floor.  Rocket recoils.

ROCKET
Something died in here.  

SMART HULK
Hello...?  Thor...?

THOR (O.S.)
Are you here about the cable?

We hear a HEAVY SHUFFLING as someone approaches.

THOR (CONT'D)
Cinemax went out two days ago, and 
the sports are all...fuzzy...

THOR enters, CONFUSED, A LITTLE DRUNK, SHIRTLESS...AND 
TREMENDOUSLY FAT.  Rocket and Hulk stare.

SMART HULK
Thor?

THOR
BROS!  Bring it in!

Thor hugs Smart Hulk.  He turns to Rocket, who steps back.  

ROCKET
Yeah, I’m good.

THOR
Hulk, you know my boys, Korg and 
Miek, right?

KORG and MIEK sit on the couch, playing Playstation 4.

KORG
Beer’s in the bucket.  Feel free to 
log on to the WiFi.

SMART HULK
Hey, guys.  Long time no-

KORG
Thor!  This kid on the TV just 
called me a dickhead!  

THOR
Noobmaster again?

KORG
NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead-

Thor snatches KORG’S HEADSET and hisses into the mic.

THOR
Noobmaster, this is Thor, again. 
God of Thunder.  This is your last 
warning.  Log off this game or I 
will come to your basement, rip off 
your arms and shove them up your 
butt.
(handing the headset back)
Right, who wants a drink?

42

43

SMART HULK AND ROCKET JUST STARE.  Thor pulls a beer from the 
fridge, and whacks the cap against STORMBREAKER.

SMART HULK
Hey, buddy, are you all right?

THOR
Don’t I look all right?

ROCKET
(under his breath)
You look like melted ice cream-

THOR
So, what’s up?  Just here for a 
hang?

SMART HULK
We need your help.  There’s a 
chance we can fix everything.

THOR
Like the cable?  It’s driving me 
bananas.

SMART HULK
Like Thanos.

THOR GRABS HULK’S SHIRT, INTENSE.  KORG RISES FROM THE COUCH.

THOR
Don’t say that name. 

KORG
Yeah, we don’t say that name in 
here.

Smart Hulk looks down at THOR’S HAND STILL ON HIS SHIRT.

SMART HULK
Please take your hand off me.

Thor looks into Hulk’s eyes...and gently removes his hand.

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Now, I know the thought of...that 
guy might scare you-

THOR
Scared?  Why would I be scared of 
that guy?  I’m the one who killed 
that guy, remember? 
(looking around)
Anyone else here kill that guy? 
(MORE)

43


THOR (CONT'D)

44

Didn’t think so.  Korg, tell 
everyone who chopped Thanos’ head 
off.

KORG
Stormbreaker?

Thor uncaps a whiskey bottle.  BLAM, IT SHATTERS IN HIS HAND.  
Reveal...ROCKET, BLASTER SMOKING.

THOR
Not.  Cool.  Man.

ROCKET
Don’t.  Care.  Dude.

SMART HULK
Look, I get it.  You’re in a rough 
patch.  I’ve been there.  But you 
know who helped me out of it?

THOR
Was it Natasha?

SMART HULK
It was you.  You helped me.  And I 
need you to help me again.

THOR
Ask the Asgardians down there how 
much “my help” is worth.  

ROCKET
At least they’re alive-

THOR
They were gods!  Now they’re 
fisherpeople!
(sagging into a chair)
The ones that are left, anyway.

SMART HULK
That’s the thing.  I think we can 
bring them back.

Thor’s tempted, but shakes his head.

THOR
Stop.  Stop.  I know you think I’m 
down here, wallowing in my own self-
pity, waiting to be rescued.  But 
I’m fine.  I’m happy.  Whatever it 
is you’re offering, don’t care.  
Couldn’t care less.

THOR (CONT'D)

44


45

Hulk and Rocket stare at Thor.  

SMART HULK
Come on, pal.  We need you.

He still can’t meet their gaze.  Finally...

ROCKET
There’s beer in the ship.

THOR
(beat)
What kind?

EXT. TOKYO - NIGHT

A KARAOKE BAR LIES IN RUINS AS A TINNY POP SONG PLAYS.

BLOOD POOLS BENEATH DEAD YAKUZA THUGS, UZIS JUST OUT OF REACH 
OF THEIR TATTOOED HANDS.  

TITLE: “TOKYO.”

AS WE PULL BACK...THE MUSIC FADES, REPLACED BY A SOFT CRYING.  
A TERRIFIED HOSTESS DARTS FROM COVER, WIPING AWAY THE CHYRON.

KEEP PULLING BACK...PAST A CAR SMASHED THROUGH THE FRONT 
WINDOW, TATTOOED DRIVER SLUMPED OVER THE WHEEL, GUN IN HAND. 

WE HEAR RAIN, A REVVING ENGINE, AND THEN GUNFIRE.

PULL ONTO THE SIDEWALK, TURNING JUST AS A MOTORCYCLE CRASHES, 
RIDER TUMBLING PAST US IN A WHITE MOHAWKED HELMET.

ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE RACES TOWARD US, BUT...

WHFT-WHFT, TWO ARROWS SEND THE RIDER SKIDDING INTO A WALL, 
TIRES SQUEALING AS THE BIKE SPINS HELPLESSLY ON ITS SIDE.

CAMERA TURNS TOWARD AN ALCOVE, WHERE A YAKUZA THUG TUMBLES 
OFF THE STAIRS AS...

A MASKED FIGURE HEADS UP, STOPPING MOMENTARILY TO DRAW HIS 
TELESCOPING BLADE.

BEHIND THE SMOKED GLASS OF SECOND FLOOR WINDOWS, THE FIGURE 
FIGHTS ANOTHER THUG.  THEN...  

CRASH, THE THUG COMES SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW.  THUD.  

WHIP THROUGH THE RAIN TO THE UPPER FLOORS OF THE BUILDING.  
GUNFIRE FLASHES AS THE FIGHT CONTINUES PAST THREE WINDOWS...

45


46

SUDDENLY, THE FOURTH WINDOW SHATTERS AS A YAKUZA BOSS, 
AKIHIKO, LEAPS OVER THE SIDEWALK...

LANDING ON THE METAL AWNING OF A NOODLE SHOP.  HE ROLLS TO 
THE WET STREET, LANDING HARD ON HIS ANKLE.

THE MYSTERIOUS FIGURE GRACEFULLY LEAPS AFTER HIM, BOUNCING 
OFF THE AWNING AND DROPPING TO THE STREET BELOW.

RACK UP TO GET OUR BEST LOOK YET AT...RONIN.  HARD-SET EYES 
STARE AT AKIHIKO THROUGH A BLACK MASK.  THEY BATTLE. 

AKIHIKO
(Japanese, subtitled)
Why are you doing this?  We never 
did anything to you!

RONIN
(Japanese, subtitled)
You survived.  Half the planet 
didn’t.  They got Thanos.  You get 
me.  

Akihiko attacks.  Ronin slashes him across the middle.

RONIN (CONT'D)
(Japanese, subtitled)
You’re done hurting people.

Akihiko gestures at the bodies in the street.

AKIHIKO
We hurt people?  You’re crazy.

Ronin slashes Akihiko’s throat.  The man drops to his knees.

AKIHIKO (CONT'D)
Wait!  Help me!  I’ll give you 
anything!  What do you want?

RONIN
What I want...you can’t give me.

Ronin finishes him off.  AKIHIKO GOES STILL.  SIRENS WAIL.  
Ronin removes his mask, revealing...

CLINT BARTON, haggard.  He hears A FOOTFALL.  He whirls, 
katana raised...then stops.  His face goes slack as...  

NATASHA STEPS INTO A POOL OF LIGHT, A LARGE BLACK UMBRELLA 
KEEPING HER FROM THE RAIN.  

They stare at each other.  Clint hasn’t seen her in years.  
She hasn’t seen what he’s become.

CLINT BARTON
You shouldn’t be here.

NATASHA
Neither should you.

CLINT BARTON
I’ve got a job to do.

NATASHA
That what you’re calling this?

She moves even closer.  He stiffens.

NATASHA (CONT'D)
Killing these people isn’t going to 
bring your family back.
(beat)
We found something.  A chance, 
maybe...

CLINT BARTON
Don’t.

NATASHA
Don’t what?

CLINT BARTON
Give me hope.

NATASHA
I’m just sorry I couldn’t give it 
sooner.

CLINT DISSOLVES, sagging into her arms.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

THOR STANDS WITH A BEER IN A COZY, staring at A NEW QUANTUM 
TUNNEL (2.0), AFFIXED WITH TONY’S CAPACITOR.

TONY (O.S.)
Out of the way, Lebowski.

Thor shuffles aside as Tony blows past.  

TONY (CONT'D)
Hey, Ratchet, you get lost in 
there?

ROCKET (O.S.)
It’s Rocket, and shut up.  You’re 
only a genius on Earth, pal.

47


48

TONY
And you’re only in there because 
you have tiny hands.

ROCKET, COVERED IN GREASE, WRIGGLES OUT A HATCH.

ROCKET
Fixed it.  

TONY
Thank you.

ROCKET
Get used to saying that.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

SMART HULK fits SCOTT with A BRAND NEW TIME SUIT.  NEBULA 
ASSISTS.  RHODEY enters the workshop, eyeing the suit.

RHODEY
Time travel suit, I like it.

SMART HULK awkwardly tries to fit a pair of RED TEST TUBES 
INTO THE TIME SUIT’S BELT.  

SCOTT LANG
Easy, easy.  Careful with those.

SMART HULK
I’m being very careful-

SCOTT LANG
You’re being very Hulky-

Scott takes the tubes from him and inserts them, himself.

SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
These are Pym Particles.  You can’t 
shrink to the Quantum Realm without 
them, and since Hank Pym got 
snapped out of existence, we can’t 
make any more.  I told you.  We’ve 
only got enough for one round trip 
each, no do-overs.

Scott gently clicks the tubes into their housing.  

SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
Plus two test runs-

SUDDENLY, SCOTT SHRINKS INTO NOTHING, THEN GROWS BACK.  He 
takes that in...

48


49

SCOTT LANG (CONT'D)
One test run.
(embarrassed)
Okay, maybe I’m not ready.

CLINT BARTON (O.S.)
I’m game.

They turn to see CLINT leaning in the doorway.

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
I’ll do it.

TIME CUT:

NOW, CLINT WEARS THE TIME SUIT.  Scott looks on, sulky.  
SMART HULK, RHODEY, and NEBULA attach the Pym housing.

SMART HULK
Okay, Clint, you might feel a 
little disoriented when you 
chronoshift-

RHODEY
Hang on, I’ve got to ask, if we can 
do this, why don’t we just go find 
baby Thanos and, you know...

Rhodey makes a STRANGLING GESTURE.

SMART HULK
Uh, one, because that’s horrible.  
And, two, killing baby Thanos 
doesn’t kill adult Thanos.  Time 
doesn’t work like that.  You can’t 
change the future by changing the 
past.

SCOTT LANG
Sure, we can.  We take the stones 
before Thanos gets them, then he 
doesn’t have them.  Problem solved.

NEBULA
That’s not how it works.

CLINT BARTON
I don’t know.  That is kind of what 
I’ve heard-

SMART HULK
Heard from who?  

49


50

RHODEY
Star Trek.  Terminator.  Bill and 
Ted’s Excellent- 

SMART HULK
WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK THIS?  
THAT’S NOT TRUE.  IF YOU TRAVEL TO 
THE PAST, THEN THAT PAST HAS BECOME 
YOUR PRESENT, AND YOUR FORMER 
PRESENT HAS BECOME THE PAST, WHICH 
NOW CAN’T BE CHANGED BY YOUR NEW 
FUTURE!

NEBULA
Exactly.

RHODEY
Excuse me?

Scott leans over, whispering:

SCOTT LANG
Apparently, Back to the Future is bullshit.

CLINT BARTON
Look, are we doing this or not?

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

CLINT WAITS ALONE ON THE PLATFORM, WEARING THE TIME SUIT.

SMART HULK readies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE as ROCKET, RHODEY, 
NEBULA, THOR, and STEVE look on.

SMART HULK
Okay, Clint.  Starting in three, 
two, one...

Clint nods over at them, determined.  SUDDENLY, HE STRETCHES, 
SHRINKS, AND VANISHES.  WHOOSH. 

EXT. BARTON HOME, BARN - DAY

Through the slats of a barn, we see a tractor.  ENERGY 
FLARES, REVEALING CLINT BARTON IN A TIME SUIT.  

He walks to the open door, staring at...HIS OLD HOME. 

50


51

EXT./INT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY

Clint climbs the porch.  He accidentally kicks...A BASEBALL 
MITT.  Then he hears VOICES.  

He stares into the house through THE SCREEN DOOR.  From the 
sounds of it, LAURA and THE KIDS are making dinner. 

HIS DAUGHTER LAUGHS.  Clint’s face crumples.  Just then...HIS 
QUANTUM CUFF VIBRATES.  A SCREEN COUNTS DOWN: 0:03.

CLINT BARTON
No.  Not yet...
(opening the door)
LILA!

BUT HIS BODY STARTS TO GLOW.  0.01-  CLINT VANISHES.  THE 
SCREEN DOOR SLAMS.  After a moment, LILA runs in.

LILA BARTON
Dad?

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

CLINT APPEARS ON THE PAD, SHAKEN.  TONY and NATASHA approach.  

NATASHA
Are you all right?  Hey, look at 
me.  You okay?

TONY
Tell me something good...

Clint looks up, tearful.  He holds out THE BASEBALL MITT.  

CLINT BARTON
It worked.  It worked.

Reveal Steve, Smart Hulk, Nebula, Rhodey, Scott, Thor, and 
Rocket, looking on.

ROCKET
Holy crap.  We’re freaking time 
travelers.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 1 - DAY (MOCO)

On a HOLO-BOARD: “MIND, SPACE, TIME, POWER, REALITY, SOUL.”  
Above each word hovers...ITS ARTIFACT: 

LOKI’S SCEPTER, THE TESSERACT, THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO, THE ORB, 
THE AETHER CONTAINER, AND A QUESTION MARK.

51


52

STEVE
Okay.  Now that we’ve got how, 
we’re going to need where and when.

NEBULA, TONY, RHODEY, SCOTT, SMART HULK, ROCKET, NATASHA, and 
CLINT look on.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Most folks here have encountered at 
least one of the six Infinity 
Stones-

TONY
I think you mean nearly been killed 
by one of the six Infinity Stones.

SCOTT LANG
I haven’t.
(off their looks)
Just...saying.

SMART HULK
Regardless, we’ve only got enough 
Pym Particles for one round trip, 
each.  And the Stones have been in 
a lot of places throughout history.   

TONY
Our history.  Not all of them are 
going to be a fun drop-in.

CLINT BARTON
Which means we’ve got to pick our 
targets.

STEVE
Exactly.
(he taps “REALITY”)
Let’s start with the Aether.  Thor, 
what do we know?

Everyone looks toward...THOR, slumped over.

NATASHA
Is he asleep?

RHODEY
I’m pretty sure he’s dead. 

DISSOLVE TO:

THOR sulks, looking at the Aether Container Holo: “REALITY”     
Locations are listed: “SVARTALFHEIM, KNOWHERE, LONDON.”

53

THOR
The Aether’s not a stone, it’s more 
of an angry sludge.  My grandfather 
hid it from Dark Elves in a rock 
between dimensions that can only be 
accessed every 5000 years.

HIS ROBOTIC EYE drifts off in the wrong direction.  Thor 
bangs his head, resetting his eye.

THOR (CONT'D)
Or...by Jane.  She stuck her hand 
in a rock.  Then the Aether stuck 
itself inside her.  Then I took her 
to Asgard.  We were dating... 
(depressed)
We’re not anymore.

Everyone stares.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 2 - DAY (MOCO)

CLOSE ON a holo image of THE ORB: “POWER.”  Locations are 
listed: “MORAG ?-2014, KYLN 2014, XANDAR 2014-2018.”

FIND ROCKET AS HE SLURPS FROM A CONTAINER OF LO MEIN.

ROCKET
Quill said he stole the Power Stone 
from Morag.  

He paces on top of the table, past SMART HULK EATING A PINT 
OF “HUNKA HULKA BURNING FUDGE.”

SMART HULK
That’s a person?

ROCKET
It’s a planet.  Quill was a person.

SCOTT LANG
Wait, like a planet...in space?

Rocket pinches Scott’s cheek.

ROCKET
Aw, look.  It’s like a puppy, all 
happy and everything.

You want to go to space, puppy?  
I’ll take you to space. 

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, SITTING AREA - DAY

Scott, Steve, Natasha, Clint, Rocket, and Smart Hulk sit 
quietly, listening to Nebula.

NEBULA
Thanos found the Soul Stone on 
Vormir.

NATASHA
And that is...?

NEBULA
A dominion of death at the very 
center of celestial existence.
(beat)
It’s the place where Thanos 
murdered my sister.

That hangs heavily.  A moment passes.  Then...

SCOTT LANG
Not it.

DISSOLVE TO:

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, OFFICE - DAY, EARLY

Tony, Natasha, and Smart Hulk hash it out.

NATASHA
So this ‘Time Stone’ guy...what 
kind of doctor was he?

SMART HULK
Strange?

TONY
Cross between ear-nose-and-throat 
and rabbit-from-hat.

SMART HULK
Had a nice place in the Village. 

TONY
Yeah.  Sullivan Street.

ROCKET (CONT'D)

54


55

SMART HULK
Bleecker.

TONY
Sullivan and Bleecker.  They’re 
cross streets.

NATASHA
Wait, he lived in New York?  Guys, 
pick the right year and there were 
three stones in New York. 

SMART HULK
(beat)
Shut the front door...

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 3 - DAY

STEVE blocks our view. 

STEVE
Okay, we have a plan.  Six stones, 
three teams, one shot.

He steps away, revealing the board...

EVERYONE EYES THE TANGLE OF LINES CONNECTING SIX STONES TO 
FOUR LOCATIONS TO TWO YEARS TO TEN HEROES.  IT’S INSANE.

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAWN 

DAWN RISES OUTSIDE HUGE WINDOWS.  OUR HEROES MARCH PAST IN 
THEIR TIME SUITS.

STEVE (O.S.)
Five years ago, we lost.  All of 
us.  

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

THE HEROES GATHER ON THE QUANTUM PLATFORM. 

STEVE
We lost friends.  We lost family.  
We lost a part of ourselves.
(beat)
But today we have a chance to take 
it all back.

Steve takes in the groupings of heroes: RHODEY & NEBULA, NAT 
& CLINT, THOR & ROCKET, TONY & SCOTT.

55


56

STEVE (CONT'D)
You have your teams and you have 
assignments.  Get your stone, and 
get back here.  One round trip 
each.  No mistakes.  No do-overs.  

He grips HIS SHIELD.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Most of us are going back to places 
we know.  That doesn’t mean we know 
what to expect.  Be careful.  Look 
out for each other.  Improvise, if 
you have to.
(looking around)
This is the fight of our lives.  
And we’re going to win.  
(beat)
Whatever it takes. 

The platform stays quiet.  Rocket WHISPERS to Scott:

ROCKET
He’s pretty good at that...

Scott nods enthusiastically. 

TONY
(to Smart Hulk)
All right, you heard the man. 
Stroke those keys, Jolly Green.

Smart Hulk taps in commands with HIS PENCIL.  LIGHTS 
ILLUMINATE EACH PAD.

SMART HULK
Tracking beacons engaged.  

Clint checks his pocket: A SHRUNKEN BENATAR sits inside.

ROCKET
You promise to bring that thing 
back in one piece?

CLINT BARTON
Yeah, sure thing.  I’ll do my best.

ROCKET
That’s pretty lame, as far as 
promises go.

SMART HULK STEPS ONTO THE PLATFORM, COMPLETING THE LINEUP.  
THE PLATFORM BEGINS TO VIBRATE.  NATASHA LOOKS AROUND.

56


57

NATASHA
See you in a minute.

SMART HULK
Actually, it’ll be closer to seven 
or eight microseconds, give or-

SUDDENLY, THEY STRETCH AND VANISH, SHRINKING AWAY.  WHOOSH. 

THE QUANTUM CONSOLE STOPS VIBRATING.  HULK’S PENCIL SLOWLY 
ROLLS TOWARD THE EDGE...AND DROPS OFF-

EXT. NEW YORK CITY - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

TITLE: NEW YORK, 2012

THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK RAGES.  IN THE MIDDLE OF IT ALL, THE 
AVENGERS GATHER IN A CIRCLE, FACING IMPOSSIBLE ODDS.

At the same time, just a block away...

EXT. NEW YORK CITY, ALLEY - CONTINUOUS (AVENGERS 1)

FLASH!  STEVE, SMART HULK, TONY, and SCOTT arrive at the 
mouth of an alley, just out of sight.

TONY
Okay, Park Avenue’s that way.  
Let’s huddle up.  Suits off.

They all touch their cuffs, RETRACTING THEIR TIME SUITS. 

STEVE
We’ve all got our assignments.  Two 
stones uptown, one stone down.  
Stay low, keep an eye on time-  

Just then, A1 HULK BOUNDS DOWN THE STREET SMASHING THINGS.

STEVE (CONT'D)
And Bruce?  Maybe smash a few 
things along the way.  For 
appearances.

SMART HULK
(taking off his shirt)
All right, but I have to say, it 
seems gratuitous.

He half-heartedly smashes a few cars. 

57

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Grrr...grrr...

EXT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM, ROOF - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK RAGES.  CHITAURI CHARIOTS ZOOM OVER 
THE VILLAGE.  SUDDENLY...BOOM, THE CHARIOTS EXPLODE.  

ON ONE SIDE OF THE SANCTUM ROOF, A TINY, HOODED FIGURE hurls 
jagged mandalas into the sky.  

ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOF...SMART HULK LANDS.  He heads 
for a door, but...

ANCIENT ONE (O.S.)
I’d be careful going that way...

He turns to find...THE ANCIENT ONE STARING AT HIM.

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
We just had the floors waxed.

SMART HULK THINKS, THEN GROWLS, TRYING TO INTIMIDATE HER.

SMART HULK
Hulk...does what...Hulk want?

ANCIENT ONE
Yes, I suppose that would be the 
case-

JUST THEN, ON THE ROOF OPPOSITE, A1 HULK TACKLES A CHITAURI 
CHARIOT, RIPPING IT IN HALF.  HE ROARS, LEAPING AWAY.

Smart Hulk blinks, sheepish.  The Ancient One looks at him. 

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
Care to explain?

SMART HULK
I’m looking for Dr. Strange.

ANCIENT ONE
You’re about five years too early.  
Stephen Strange is currently 
performing surgery, 20 blocks that 
way.  What do you want with him?

He finally notices THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO HANGING FROM HER NECK.

SMART HULK
Well, that, actually.

58


59

ANCIENT ONE
Ah.  I’m afraid not.

SMART HULK
I’m seriously sorry but...I wasn’t 
asking.

Smart Hulk cracks his knuckles and moves in.  She smiles.

ANCIENT ONE
You don’t want to do this.

SMART HULK
You’re right, I don’t.  But I need 
that stone, and I don’t have a lot 
of time to debate it-

He reaches for it.  THE ANCIENT ONE SLAMS HER PALM INTO HIS 
CHEST AND BLASTS BRUCE BANNER RIGHT OUT OF SMART HULK.

“ASTRAL BANNER” hangs in the air, staring at his frozen Smart 
Hulk body.  He looks at his human hands, overwhelmed.

ASTRAL BANNER
No, no, no-

She topples Smart Hulk’s body with one finger.  Whump.

ANCIENT ONE
Now.  Let’s start over, shall we?

INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2) 

TITLE: ASGARD, 2013

AN ASGARDIAN MAIDEN stands at JANE’S ROOM, handing over A 
GREEN DRESS.

MAIDEN (O.S.)
For you, Lady Jane.

JANE FOSTER (O.S.)
Um, do you have anything 
with...pants?

MAIDEN (O.S.)
Pants?

JANE FOSTER (O.S.)
It’s okay.  Nevermind.  

Pull back to...ROCKET AND THOR, WATCHING from behind a crypt.  
Rocket holds a syringe-like EXTRACTION DEVICE.  

59


60

THOR
That’s Jane.

ROCKET
Okay, here’s the deal.  You’re 
going to charm her, and I’m going 
to poke her with this thing, 
extract the Reality Stone, and get 
gone lickety-split.

Thor looks off in the other direction, anxious.

THOR
Um, I’ll be right back.  The wine 
cellar is just down here.  My 
father used to have this barrel of 
Aakonian ale.  Felt like getting 
hit in the face with a poleaxe. 
I’ll see if the scullery has a 
couple of to-go cups-

They hear SOMEONE APPROACHING.  Rocket yanks Thor back 
as...FRIGGA AND HER HANDMAIDENS ENTER THE CORRIDOR.  

FRIGGA
Send Loki some soup.  I don’t think 
he’s eating.  And ask our 
librarians to pull some volumes 
from the astronomy shelves.  He 
won’t read them, but at least 
they’ll keep him company.

Thor watches Frigga and her coterie disappear down the hall.

ROCKET
Who’s the fancy broad?

THOR
My mother.  She dies today.

ROCKET
Oh, jeez.

Thor starts to sweat.

THOR
I can’t do this.  This is a bad 
idea.  I can’t do this...

Rocket climbs onto a marble monument.

ROCKET
Come here.

60


(MORE)

61

Thor steps closer.  ROCKET SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE.

ROCKET (CONT'D)
You think you’re the only one who’s 
lost people?  What do you think 
we’re doing here?  I lost the only 
family I ever had.  Quill, Groot, 
Drax, the chick with the antenna.  
All gone.  I’ve lived five 
meaningless years without them, and 
every minute has blown Aaskvarian 
gornads.  I get you miss your mom.  
But she’s gone.  Really gone.  
There are plenty of people who are 
only kind of gone.  And you can 
help them.  So, is it too much to 
ask that you brush the crumbs out 
of your beard, make shmoopy talk to 
Prettypants, and when she’s not 
looking, suck out the Infinity 
Stone, and help me get my family 
back? 

Thor stares at him a long moment.  He wipes his tears away.

THOR
I guess not.  

ROCKET
Good.

THOR
Thank you.  I can do this.

ROCKET
Great.

As Rocket scurries to Jane’s door, Thor murmurs to himself.

THOR
I can do this...I can do this...
(beat)
I can’t do this...

ROCKET
(peering through keyhole)
All right, heartbreaker.  This is 
our shot...

Rocket turns to find...THOR NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.

ROCKET (CONT'D)

EXT. MORAG - DAY (GUARDIANS)

TITLE: MORAG, 2014

STIFF WINDS PELT THE SURFACE OF MORAG.  RHODEY STEERS NEBULA 
AS SHE LOWERS THE ESCAPE POD FROM THE NOW FULL-SIZED BENATAR.

RHODEY
That’s it, right on that line, 
Blue.  Keep dropping it.

Nearby, CLINT SURVEYS THE PLANET.  GEYSERS EXPLODE.  CLIFFS 
LOOM.  AN ORLONI bites NATASHA’s boot.  She kicks it away.

CLINT BARTON
(to Rhodey)
Hey, can we hurry it up? 

NATASHA
Yeah, come on, chop chop, we’re on 
the clock, here.

RHODEY
All that?  Really helpful!

TIME CUT:

Clint and Natasha board the Benatar.  Rhodey and Nebula 
remain on the planet’s surface.

NATASHA
Take care of yourself.

RHODEY
Get that stone and come back.  No 
messing around.  You guys watch 
each other’s six. 

TIME CUT:

BESIDE THE POD, RHODEY AND NEBULA WATCH THE BENATAR TAKE OFF.

NEBULA
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in.  
All they have to do is not fall 
out.

INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - DAY (GUARDIANS)

Clint laughs, watching Natasha expertly pilot a spaceship.  

NATASHA
What?

CLINT BARTON
Nothing.  Just...we’re a long way 
from Budapest.

NATASHA
(pushing the throttle)
Further every second.

EXT. MORAG - DAY (GUARDIANS)

RHODEY SCANS THE LANDSCAPE.

RHODEY
So, all we have to do is hang out, 
wait for this Quill guy, and follow 
him to the Power Stone, right?

NEBULA
Let’s take cover.  We’re not the 
only ones in this reality looking 
for the stones.

RHODEY
Hey, who are you talking about 
right now?  Who else is looking for 
the stones?

NEBULA
My father.  My sister.  And me.

MOVE IN ON RHODEY, CONCERNED.

RHODEY
You?  Where are you?

CUT TO:

EXT. BATTLEFIELD, ALIEN PLANET - DAY

BAD NEBULA CUTS DOWN A KORBINITE SOLDIER WITH DUAL BLADES.

She leads Thanos’ troops onward as they lay waste to the 
Korbinite home world.  JUST THEN...

63


64

BLAM!  A GRENADE KNOCKS BAD NEBULA TO HER KNEES.  TWO 
KORBINITE RIFLEMEN BEAR DOWN ON HER.  

Suddenly, A GREEN BLUR LEAPS IN, SLICING THE RIFLEMEN’S 
THROATS.  THE TWO HUGE SOLDIERS DROP...

REVEALING GAMORA looking down at her sister.  Beat.

GAMORA
You’re welcome?

BAD NEBULA
I didn’t ask for your help.

GAMORA
And yet you always need it.  Father 
wants us back on the ship.

Gamora offers her hand.  Bad Nebula stands on her own.

BAD NEBULA
Why?

GAMORA
He’s found an Infinity Stone.

Off Bad Nebula’s intrigued look...

INT. Q-SHIP - DAY

BAD NEBULA and GAMORA study a holo-map.

BAD NEBULA
Where?

GAMORA
On a planet called “Morag.”

EXT. BATTLEFIELD, ALIEN PLANET - DAY

A DARK FIGURE ADVANCES ACROSS THE SMOKY FIELD, RELENTLESS. 

BAD NEBULA (O.S.)
Father’s plan is finally in motion.

GAMORA (O.S.)
One stone isn’t six.

ALIENS RUN FOR COVER, SCREAMING.  SOMETHING CUTS THEM DOWN...

64


65

BAD NEBULA (O.S.)
It’s a start.  If he gets them 
all...

THANOS steps from the smoke, armored, wielding A HUGE BLADE.  

GAMORA (O.S.)
We’ll never have to do this again.

THREE ALIENS CHARGE HIM.  THANOS CUTS THEM DOWN.  He wipes 
blood from his face, and SMILES.

BAD NEBULA (O.S.)
He’ll miss it.

A SMALL FIGHTER FLIES IN, STRAFING HIM.  NEVER BREAKING 
STRIDE, THANOS SLICES IT IN TWO. 

He looks up to his ship.  A BEAM BATHES HIM IN LIGHT...

INT. Q-SHIP - DAY

Bad Nebula and Gamora turn as THANOS ENTERS THE FLIGHT DECK.  

THANOS
Ronan has located the Power Stone.  
I’m dispatching you to his ship.

GAMORA
He won’t like it.

Thanos wipes the blood from his blade.

THANOS
His alternative is death.  Ronan’s 
obsession clouds his judgement.  
After Loki, I’m taking no chances.

BAD NEBULA
We will not fail you, father.

Thanos finally lays his eyes on her.

THANOS
No.  You won’t.

BAD NEBULA
I swear I will make you proud-

SUDDENLY, BAD NEBULA STAGGERS, hand to the wall.

GAMORA
Sister, what’s-

65


66

Thanos watches, curious, as NEBULA DROPS TO A KNEE.  
SUDDENLY, A HOLO-PROJECTION OF RHODEY BEAMS FROM HER EYE.

RHODEY (HOLO)
So, all we have to do is hang out, 
wait for this Quill guy, and follow 
him to the Power Stone, right?

NEBULA (HOLO) (O.S)
Let’s take cover.  We’re not the 
only ones in this reality looking 
for the stones.

BAD NEBULA SLUMPS, breaking the projection.  Gamora goes to 
her, trying to prop her up.

GAMORA
Who was that?

BAD NEBULA
I...don’t know.  My 
head...splitting...

Bad Nebula winces.  Gamora looks to Thanos.

GAMORA
Her synaptic drive was probably 
damaged in battle- 

THANOS
Sshhh...

Thanos looks down at Bad Nebula.  He gently lifts her head 
with his blade.  Something’s not right. 

THANOS (CONT'D)
Bring her to my ship.

EXT. STARK TOWER, PENTHOUSE - DAY (AVENGERS 1) 

Tony swoops onto the helipad outside the wrecked penthouse.

INT. STARK TOWER, PENTHOUSE - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

THE MIND STONE GLOWS IN LOKI’S SCEPTER.  Pull back to see 
it’s in A1 NATASHA’S HANDS, as she stands with...

A1 THOR, A1 STEVE, A1 TONY, A1 HULK, AND A1 CLINT (THE ICONIC 
SHOT FROM AVENGERS 1), all staring down at...LOKI.

66


67

LOKI
If it’s all the same to you...I’ll 
have that drink now.

From behind cover, TONY PEERS AT THE BACK SIDE OF THE 
AVENGERS TABLEAU.

TONY (INTO COM)
Cap, I’ve got to say that outfit 
does nothing for your ass.

STEVE (OVER COM)
No one asked you to look, Tony.

REVEAL TINY SCOTT ON TONY’S SHOULDER.

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
I think you look great, Cap.  As 
far as I’m concerned, that’s 
America’s ass.

A1 NATASHA
Who gets the magic wand?

A1 STEVE
SHIELD’s coming up now.

TONY
Ball’s in play.  Head’s up, Cap.

From hiding, Tony eyes A1 NATASHA WITH LOKI’S SCEPTER.

INTERCUT:

INT. STARK TOWER, HALLWAY - DAY

STEVE negotiates an empty hallway, head on a swivel.  He 
heads for AN ELEVATOR.

TONY (OVER COM)
Mind Stone’s on the move.

STEVE (INTO COM)
I’m in position.

INT. STARK TOWER, PENTHOUSE - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

A1 NATASHA hands LOKI’S SCEPTER to...AGENT SITWELL.  He’s 
about to touch the tip when...

A1 NATASHA
Careful with that.

67


68

A1 CLINT pours himself A DRINK at Tony’s bar.

A1 CLINT BARTON
Unless you want your mind erased.  
And not in the fun way.

Sitwell carries the scepter to THE SERVICE ELEVATOR...WHERE A 
STRIKE TEAM WAITS.  BROCK RUMLOW hits “down.”

BROCK RUMLOW
We promise to be extra careful.

Scott stares at Sitwell and Rumlow. 

SCOTT LANG
Who are these guys? 

TONY
SHIELD.  Actually, Hydra.  But we 
didn’t know that yet. 

SCOTT LANG
Seriously?  ‘Cause it’s kind of 
obvious they’re bad guys. 

TONY
You’re small but you’re talking 
loud.

A1 THOR WALKS LOKI PAST A1 STEVE.

A1 STEVE (INTO COM)
I’m on my way down to coordinate 
search and rescue.

Loki rolls his eyes...AND TRANSFORMS INTO A COPY OF STEVE.

LOKI/STEVE
“I’m on my way down to coordinate 
search and rescue.”  I mean, 
really, how do you keep your food 
down?

Thor slaps A MUZZLE on Loki, who REVERTS TO HIS OWN FORM.  

A1 THOR
Yes, that’s much better.

He steers his brother into THE MAIN ELEVATOR.

A1 THOR (CONT'D)
You coming, Stark?

68


69

Nearby, A1 TONY uses his gauntleted hand to place THE 
TESSERACT into AN ALUMINUM ATTACHE CASE.  

A1 TONY
One sec, just packing my lunch.

TONY
All right, you’re up, Little Buddy.  
There’s our stone

A1 Tony crosses to the elevator.  Scott takes position, 
readying himself.

SCOTT LANG
All right.  Flick me.

Tony flicks Scott with a finger, sending him sailing into the 
ATTACHE CASE.

TONY leaps out the window, Bleeding Edge armor forming around 
him as he falls.

A1 Tony joins the others in the elevator.  Then...

A1 HULK steps up to THE ALREADY CROWDED ELEVATOR.  Avengers 
smile awkwardly.  There’s no room. 

A1 HULK
(angrily)
Hulk take stairs.

EXT. STARK TOWER - DAY

Tony circles around the building...PASSING THE DESCENDING 
SERVICE ELEVATOR, CROWDED WITH RUMLOW’S STRIKE TEAM.

TONY (O.S.)
Okay, Cap, I make ten of them, just 
passing the 80th floor.

STEVE (O.S.)
Got it.  Head to the lobby.

TONY (O.S.)
Already on my way.

INT. STARK TOWER, SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

Sitwell, Rumlow, and the STRIKE TEAM descend.

69


70

AGENT SITWELL (INTO PHONE)
Evidence secured, we are en route 
to Dr. List...No, no hitches at 
all, Mr. Secretary...  

The car stops.  The doors open...AND OUR STEVE GETS ON.  

AGENT SITWELL (CONT'D)
Captain, I thought you were 
coordinating search and rescue?

STEVE
Change of plans.

Steve glances at Rumlow, who’s holding THE SCEPTER. 

BROCK RUMLOW
Cap.

STEVE
Rumlow. 

The doors close.  Everyone rides in silence.  Tension mounts.

STEVE (CONT'D)
I got a call from the Secretary’s 
office.  I’m going to be running 
point on the scepter.

Behind him, Sitwell and Rumlow exchange a glance. 

AGENT SITWELL
Sir?  I don’t understand-

STEVE
We’ve had word there might be an 
attempt to steal it.

Steve reaches for the scepter, but Rumlow holds tight.

BROCK RUMLOW
Afraid we can’t allow that, Cap.  

AGENT SITWELL
(pulling out his phone)
I’ll have to check with the 
Director-

STEVE
No.  Trust me.  It’s okay...

Steve leans in, drawing them all close.  Then he whispers:

70


71

STEVE (CONT'D)
Hail Hydra.

THEIR EYES GO WIDE.

INT. STARK TOWER, 10TH FLOOR - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

The elevator OPENS.  Steve steps out with THE SCEPTER.  
Sitwell and Rumlow stare after him, amazed.  

THE DOORS CLOSE.  STEVE SMILES TO HIMSELF.

INT. STARK TOWER, STAIRWELL - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

A1 HULK lumbers down the stairs, taking chunks out of corners 
in the tiny stairwell.  He snorts, growing more pissed off.

A1 HULK
SO MANY STAIRS!

INT. STARK TOWER, LOBBY - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

A1 TONY carries the TESSERACT CASE through THE LOBBY, 
followed by A1 THOR and LOKI.  

SWAT TROOPERS clear a path.  ONE TURNS ASIDE, RAISING HIS 
MASK, REVEALING...OUR TONY.

TONY (INTO COM)
Okay, Thumbelina, you’re a go.

MOVE IN CLOSE on A1 TONY to see...SCOTT, HIDING IN HIS HAIR.

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
Bombs away.

SCOTT DROPS BENEATH TONY’S BLACK SABBATH SHIRT.

INT. TONY STARK’S SHIRT - CONTINUOUS (AVENGERS 1)

SCOTT slides down Tony’s clavicle to the RT.  He sniffs.

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
Is that...Axe body spray?

TONY (OVER COM)
Yeah, I had a can in the desk for 
emergencies.  Can we focus, please?

71


72

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
I’m going inside you...NOW.

SCOTT SQUEEZES BETWEEN A1 TONY’S SKIN AND THE RT. 

INT. STARK TOWER, LOBBY - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

A1 TONY, A1 THOR, and LOKI approach the door.  ALEXANDER 
PIERCE intercepts them with a team of SHIELD AGENTS.

ALEXANDER PIERCE
Mind if I ask where you’re going?

A1 THOR
We were thinking lunch, then 
Asgard.  And you are?

A1 TONY
Alexander Pierce.  He’s the guy 
behind the guys behind Fury, so 
don’t mess.

ALEXANDER PIERCE
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.
(to Thor)
I have to ask you to turn the 
prisoner over to me.

A1 THOR
Loki will answer to Odin, himself.

ALEXANDER PIERCE
No, he’ll answer to us.  “Odin” can 
have what’s left. 
(to Tony)
And we’ll need the case back, too.  
That’s been SHIELD property for 
over seventy years.  

A1 TONY
I’m not gonna argue who has 
authority here but jurisdictionally 
speaking, we are on Stark property. 
That is my name on the glass...

ALEXANDER PIERCE
Just give me the case.

Across the lobby, TONY OBSERVES FROM BEHIND HIS SWAT HELMET.  

72


73

TONY (INTO COM)
Move it, Stuart Little.  Things are 
getting dicey out here.

INTERCUT:

INT. TONY STARK’S RT - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

Scott studies A TANGLE OF COPPER WIRING.

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
This place is a mess.
(finding a wire)
You promise you won’t die?

TONY (OVER COM)
You’re only giving me a minor 
cardiac dysrhythmia-

SCOTT LANG
That doesn’t actually sound minor-

Tony sees PIERCE reaching for A1 TONY’S CASE.

TONY
Window’s closing.  Pull my plug.

SCOTT LANG
Here goes...

SCOTT YANKS THE WIRE OUT OF ITS SOCKET.

IN THE LOBBY, A1 TONY GRIPS HIS CHEST.

ALEXANDER PIERCE
Stark?

A1 Tony SEIZES, dropping.  THE TESSERACT CASE CLATTERS TO THE 
GROUND.  PIERCE and A1 THOR kneel to assist.

ALEXANDER PIERCE (CONT'D)
MEDIC!

A1 THOR
Stark?  Somebody get some help!  Is 
it your chest machine?

THE LOBBY BUZZES, SHIELD AGENTS RUNNING EVERYWHERE.

In the bustle, SCOTT SLIDES OUT OF A1 TONY’S SLEEVE.  He 
SHOVES THE TESSERACT CASE HARD.  It SPINS across the floor... 

RIGHT INTO TONY’S HAND.  Tony walks toward a side door.

73


74

TONY (INTO COM)
Meet me in the alley.  I’m just 
gonna grab a slice at Famous Ray’s- 

BUT AS TONY PASSES THE STAIRWELL DOOR...HULK BANGS IT OPEN, 
SMASHING TONY IN THE FACE, SENDING HIM TUMBLING. 

A1 HULK BASHES HIS WAY THROUGH THE LOBBY.

The Tesseract Case hits the floor, popping open.  THE 
TESSERACT FALLS OUT, spinning past Tiny Scott...

STOPPING AT LOKI’S FEET.  Loki stares at it in disbelief.  He 
glances at A1 Thor and Pierce giving A1 Tony first aid. 

THEN LOKI CALMLY REACHES DOWN WITH HIS MANACLED HANDS, GRASPS 
THE TESSERACT...AND TELEPORTS AWAY.  Scott stares, stunned.

SCOTT LANG
That wasn’t supposed to happen, was 
it?

A1 THOR LOOKS UP, REALIZING...

A1 THOR
WHERE’S LOKI? 

SHIELD TEAMS FAN OUT, ON ALERT.

INT. STARK TOWER, 14TH FLOOR - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

STEVE heads down a hall, SCEPTER IN HAND. 

SECURITY (OVER SPEAKER)
Building-wide alert, all units.  
Target Loki, maximum force.

STEVE (INTO COM)
Tony?  What’s going on?  Tell me 
you got that cube-

A1 STEVE (O.S.)
Strike Teams, clear Forty, then 
work down.

Before Steve can hide...A1 STEVE ROUNDS THE CORNER.

STEVE
Oh, great.

A1 STEVE (INTO COM)
Disregard.  I have eyes on Loki, 
Fourteenth Floor.

74


75

STEVE GENTLY LAYS THE SCEPTER DOWN, AND PULLS OFF HIS SHIELD.

STEVE
I’m not Loki.  And I don’t want to 
hurt you.

A1 STEVE PULLS HIS SHIELD OFF HIS BACK.

A1 STEVE
You’re not going to get the chance-

A1 STEVE KICKS STEVE IN THE FACE.  Steve stumbles.

STEVE
Forgot about that one.

They grapple.  Both their shields fall to the ground...

THEY BOTH STAMP ON THEM, simultaneously flipping the shields 
back to their arms.  A1 Steve looks impressed.

A1 STEVE SWINGS.  STEVE DUCKS, HAMMERING HIM.  A1 Steve wipes 
the blood from his lip, squaring off.

A1 STEVE
I can do this all day-

STEVE
Yeah, I know...  

They battle on.  A1 Steve tackles Steve, knocking his shield 
aside, RIPPING OPEN ONE OF STEVE’S BELT COMPARTMENTS:

THE COMPASS FALLS OUT, OPENING TO REVEAL PEGGY’S PICTURE.  A1 
Steve goes cold.  He picks up the compass, FLABBERGASTED.

A1 STEVE
Where’d you get this?

STEVE
PX.  Camp Lehigh.  1943.

A1 Steve stares at Steve, eyes narrowing.

A1 STEVE
You’ve got a lot of nerve.

HE HAMMERS STEVE ACROSS THE HALL.  Steve goes skidding.  He 
groans, looking up to see...HE’S INCHES FROM THE SCEPTER.  

A1 STEVE moves in.  STEVE whips around, touching THE SCEPTER 
to A1 Steve’s chest.  A1 STEVE’S EYES GO BLACK.  HE FREEZES.  

75


76

Steve stares, panting.  Finally, he picks up the compass from 
the floor, then considers A1 STEVE’S ASS.

STEVE
That is America’s ass.

EXT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM, ROOF - DAY (AVENGERS 1)

SMART HULK’S BODY lies slumped on an Adirondack chair, a 
floppy sun hat covering his face.  

ANCIENT ONE (O.S.)
I wish I could help you, Bruce...  

THE ANCIENT ONE waters a rooftop garden.  She looks to ASTRAL 
BANNER, who’s only just getting used to being see-through.

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
But if I were to give up the Time 
Stone to help your reality, I’d be 
dooming my own. 

ASTRAL BANNER
Yeah, with all due respect, I’m not 
sure the science supports that.

ANCIENT ONE
And yet, you’re the one currently 
standing in the middle of my 
hydrangeas.

Banner looks down to see, indeed, he has phased through the 
middle of the hydrangeas.  He steps out of it.

ASTRAL BANNER
Lady, I just want to borrow your 
necklace- 

ANCIENT ONE
At what cost? 

SHE CONJURES A MAGICAL PROJECTION OF THE INFINITY STONES, 
SPINNING IN UNISON.  A TUNNEL OF GOLDEN LIGHT POURS FORTH.

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
The Infinity Stones create the 
experience you know as the flow of 
time.  Remove one of the stones, 
and the flow splits.  

She plucks the GREEN TIME STONE out of the array: A SMALLER, 
BLACKENED RIVER BRANCHES OFF FROM THE FIRST.

76

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
Now, your timeline might benefit.  
My new one...would definitely not.

SHE GESTURES.  OUR CAMERA ZOOMS INTO THE BLACKENED TUNNEL...

TUNNEL POV: HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE RUN AS WE FLY OVER A CROWDED 
STREET, UP TO...THE BURNING HONG KONG SANCTUM. 

ANCIENT ONE (O.S.) (CONT'D)
In this new branch reality, without 
our chief weapon against the forces 
of darkness, our world would be 
overrun...

MOVE UP TO SEE DORMAMMU IN THE SKY.  HE OPENS HIS MOUTH...

BACK ON THE ROOF...THE ANCIENT ONE PLUCKS MORE STONES FROM 
THE GOLDEN RIVER, CREATING FIVE MORE BLACKENED TRIBUTARIES.

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
For each stone you remove, you’ll 
create a new, vulnerable timeline.  
Millions will suffer.
(beat)
Now tell me, Doctor.  Can your 
science prevent all that?  

ASTRAL BANNER
No.  But it can erase it.

Astral Banner reaches in and grabs THE VIRTUAL TIME STONE.

ASTRAL BANNER (CONT'D)
Because once we’re done with the 
stones, we can return each one to 
its own timeline.  At the moment it 
was taken.  So chronologically, in 
that reality, the stone never left.  

HE PUTS THE TIME STONE BACK.  THE BLACK TIMELINE DISAPPEARS. 

ANCIENT ONE
You’re leaving out the most 
important part, though.  In order 
to put the stones back, you’d have 
to survive.

ASTRAL BANNER
We will.  I will.  I promise. 

ANCIENT ONE
I can’t risk this reality on a 
promise.

It is the duty of the Sorcerer 
Supreme to protect the Time Stone-

ASTRAL BANNER
Yeah?  Then why the hell did 
Strange give it away?

The Ancient One freezes.

ANCIENT ONE
What did you say?

ASTRAL BANNER
Strange gave Thanos the Time Stone.

ANCIENT ONE
Willingly?  Why?  

ASTRAL BANNER
Don’t know.  Maybe he made a 
mistake.

ANCIENT ONE
Or I did.

The Ancient One looks out over a recovering NYC. 

ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)
Strange is meant to be the best of 
us.

ASTRAL BANNER
Then he must have had a reason.

ANCIENT ONE
I fear you may be right...

Finally, she waves her hand and...WHOOSH!  HE REINTEGRATES 
INTO THE SMART HULK BODY.  Smart Hulk gets up, WOOZY.

SHE REMOVES THE TIME STONE FROM THE EYE, HANDING IT TO HIM.

SMART HULK
Thank you.

ANCIENT ONE
I’m counting on you, Bruce. 
(re. the city behind her)

THANOS
Run diagnostics.  Show me her

At the console, EBONY MAW SCANS NEBULA’S INFORMATION.  
NEBULA’S BODY TWITCHES.

GAMORA WATCHES, TORN.  SOON...AN ALERT FLASHES.

EBONY MAW
Sir, the file appears...entangled.  
It was a memory, but not hers.
(dawning on him)
There’s another consciousness 
sharing her network.  Another 
Nebula.

THANOS
Impossible.

EBONY MAW
This duplicate carries a time 
stamp...from nine years in the 
future.

THANOS
Where is this “other Nebula?”

EBONY MAW
In our solar system.  On Morag.

THANOS
Can you access her?

EBONY MAW
Yes.  The two are linked.

THANOS PEERS INTO BAD NEBULA’S GLASSY EYES...

THANOS
Search the duplicate’s memory for 
Infinity Stones.

Maw works the console.  Thanos steps aside as BAD NEBULA’S 
BODY QUIVERS.  AFTER A BEAT, A BEAM SHOOTS OUT OF HER EYE...

TONY (HOLO)
Our history.  Not all of them are

CLINT BARTON (HOLO)
Which means we’ve got to pick our

STEVE (HOLO)
Exactly.  Let’s start here-

THANOS
Freeze image.

THE IMAGE FREEZES.  THANOS STARES, RECOGNIZING THEM. 

GAMORA
Terrans?

THANOS
Avengers.  Unruly wretches.

He gestures to A BLURRY REFLECTION WITHIN THE HOLOGRAM.

THANOS (CONT'D)
What’s this reflection.  Amplify 
this, Maw.

EBONY MAW ZOOMS IN, REVEALING...A REFLECTION OF NEBULA.

GAMORA
I don’t understand.  Two Nebulas?

Thanos walks into the hologram, studying the faces.

THANOS
No.  The same Nebula.  From two 
different times.

INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2) 

Frigga walks down a corridor, alone.  THOR SNEAKS FROM COLUMN 
TO COLUMN, FOLLOWING HER.  She PAUSES, sensing something.  

Thor HIDES.  When he peers again, FRIGGA IS GONE.  Then he 
turns around to find FRIGGA STANDING BESIDE HIM.  Thor jumps.

FRIGGA
What are you doing?

THOR
Mother!  What?  Nothing.  Hello.

FRIGGA
You’re better off leaving the 
sneaking to your brother. 
(re. his bathrobe)
What are you wearing?

THOR
I always wear this.  It’s one of my 
favorites.

FRIGGA
And what’s wrong with your eye?

THOR
Oh, that.  You remember 
the...Battle of Harokin.  I took 
a...broadsword to the face?

He trails off, at a loss, staring at his dead mom.  Frigga 
gently lays her hand on his cheek...READING HIM.

FRIGGA
Oh.  You’re not the Thor I know at 
all, are you?

THOR
Yes, I am-

FRIGGA
I was raised by witches, boy.  I 
see with more than eyes, you know 
that.
(eyeing him)
I can see the future hasn’t been 
kind to you, has it?

THOR
I didn’t say I was from the 
future...

82

FRIGGA
Thor...

Frigga gives her son a stern, “don’t lie to me” look.  Thor 
stares at his mom a long moment.  Then, he cracks:

THOR
I’m totally from the future.

FRIGGA
Yes, you are.

THOR
I need to talk to you. 

FRIGGA
We can talk. 

Frigga GRABS Thor by the cloak and yanks him away.

HEAD, ABOUT TO JAB...

INT. ASGARD, PALACE, FRIGGA’S CHAMBER - DAY (THOR 2)

FRIGGA sits with THOR in her chambers.

THOR
...and then it was done.  His head 
over there.  Body over there.  And 
me in the middle.  Just an idiot 
with an axe.

FRIGGA
You’re no idiot.  You’re here, 
aren’t you?  Seeking counsel from 
the smartest person in Asgard?

THOR
Yeah, I guess.

FRIGGA
An idiot, no.  A failure, 
absolutely.

82


83

THOR
That’s a little harsh-

FRIGGA
Quite a colossal one, by the sound 
of it.

THOR
Okay, maybe just stop talking.

FRIGGA
And you know what that makes you?  
Just like everyone else.

THOR
I’m not supposed to be like 
everyone else, though.

FRIGGA
Everyone fails at “who they’re 
supposed to be,” Thor.  The measure 
of a person, of a hero, is how well 
they succeed at being who they are.

Thor stares at her, biting back emotions.

THOR
I’ve really missed you, Mum.

INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2)

ROCKET TEARS DOWN THE HALL, EXTRACTION DEVICE IN HAND.  

ROCKET
I got it I got it I got it!

A TROOP OF EINHERJAR CHASE AFTER HIM.

INT. ASGARD, PALACE, FRIGGA’S CHAMBER - DAY (THOR 2)

THOR looks at THE OBSERVATORY: Dark Elves will soon attack.

THOR
Mum, I have to tell you something-

FRIGGA
No, son.  You don’t.  You’ve come 
to repair your future, not mine.   

THOR
But your future-

83


84

FRIGGA
Is none of my business.

Thor stares at her, torn.  THEN ROCKET RACES INTO THE ROOM.

ROCKET
(to Frigga)
Hi.  You must be Mom.  
(to Thor, re. the device)
I got the thing.  Come on, we gotta 
move-

Thor looks to Frigga.

THOR
I wish we had more time-

FRIGGA
This was a gift.  Now, go be the 
man you’re meant to be.  
(beat)
And eat a salad.

Thor smiles.  He and Rocket activate their time suits.

ROCKET
Three...two-

THOR
No.  Wait.

THOR DRAMATICALLY HOLDS OUT HIS HAND.  A long moment passes.

ROCKET
What am I looking at?

FRIGGA
Sometimes it takes a second.

Then...MJOLNIR SAILS INTO HER SON’S HAND.  She grins, proud.

THOR
(relieved)
Still worthy.

Mother and son look at each other for the last time.  

THOR (CONT'D)
Goodbye, Mum.

FRIGGA
Goodbye, Son.

THEN, WHOOSH!  THOR AND ROCKET DISAPPEAR.  

84


85

Suddenly...THE PALACE RUMBLES.  Frigga looks to the window, 
WHERE A DARK ELF WARSHIP DECLOAKS.  SHE REACHES FOR A SWORD.

PRELAP: “COME AND GET YOUR LOVE,” BY REDBONE.

EXT. MORAG, ABANDONED CITY - DAY (GUARDIANS)

PETER QUILL, in RED, PLEATHER TRENCH COAT AND HEADPHONES, 
dances through the ruins of an alien city.

PULL BACK TO...NEBULA AND RHODEY WATCHING FROM BEHIND A ROCK.

RHODEY
So, he’s an idiot. 

NEBULA
Yes.

Quill spins, arms out, eyes shut.  When the horizon finally 
settles...he sees A METAL MAN STANDING THERE WAITING FOR HIM.

QUILL
Oh, fu-

BAM!  RHODEY DECKS QUILL IN THE FACE.  Quill drops, out cold. 

RHODEY
Sorry about that.  I know you guys 
were teammates and everything.

NEBULA
Do you hear me complaining?

Nebula rifles through Quill’s sack.  She pulls out AN 
ELECTRONIC LOCK PICK.

RHODEY
What is that?

NEBULA
The tool of a thief.  Come on.

They set out toward the RUINED CITY.  

INT. MORAG, TEMPLE VAULT - DAY (GUARDIANS)

WHIR, CLICK.  TWO HUGE, STONE DOORS SLIDE OPEN, REVEALING 
NEBULA AND RHODEY.  SHE STEPS IN.  RHODEY TRIES TO STOP HER.

85


86

RHODEY
Hang on.  This would be about the 
time the spikes come out, you know, 
with the skeletons still on them?

NEBULA
What are you talking about?

RHODEY
I’m just saying, when you break 
into a place called, “The Temple of 
the Power Stone”, there are 
usually... 

Ahead, they see...THE POWER STONE ORB HOVERING ABOVE ITS 
PEDESTAL, SURROUNDED BY A WEB OF LASER THREADS.

RHODEY (CONT'D)
Traps and stuff.
(Nebula steps inside)
Okay, don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Rhodey scans the laser web, strategizing.

RHODEY (CONT'D)
These are photovoltaic lasers on a 
constantly shifting matrix.  Gonna 
be damn near impossible to 
neutralize unless we-

SUDDENLY, NEBULA REACHES HER CYBERNETIC ARM THROUGH THE WEB.  
SHE GRABS THE ORB...BUT THE WEB GRIPS HER, FRYING HER ARM.  

She pulls out the orb, but sees Rhodey staring at HER 
BLACKENED CLAW.  

NEBULA
I wasn’t always like this.

He sees actual emotion somewhere inside her.  Favor his 
exoskeletal leg braces as he softens.

RHODEY
Yeah, me either.  I guess we do the 
best with what we’ve got, huh?  

SHE HANDS HIM THE ORB WITH JUST THE GHOST OF A SMILE.

RHODEY (CONT'D)
Let’s get out of here.  Place gives 
me the creeps.  Sync up.  Three... 
two...one...

86


(MORE)

87

RHODEY TAPS HIS CUFF, SHRINKING AWAY.  Nebula goes for 
hers...BUT HER EYES ROLL BACK.  

SHE COLLAPSES, SEIZING VIOLENTLY, THEN GOING STILL.  Her eyes 
snap open, projecting a hologram of...THANOS.

THANOS (HOLO)
What’s wrong?

INT. SANCTUARY-2, INTERROGATION CELL - DAY

BACK IN THE INTERROGATION CELL, BAD NEBULA’S EYE BEAMS: IN 
THANOS’ LODGE, THE AVENGERS SURROUND A ONE-ARMED THANOS.

THANOS STUDIES HIS HOLO-FUTURE-SELF, WATCHING HIS DESTINY 
PLAY OUT IN FRONT OF HIM.

BRUCE BANNER (HOLO)
You murdered trillions.

THANOS (HOLO)
You should be grateful.

NATASHA (HOLO)
Where are the stones?

THANOS SMIRKS, PUTTING THE PIECES TOGETHER.

THANOS (HOLO)
Gone.  Reduced to atoms.  

BRUCE BANNER (HOLO)
You used them two days ago!

THANOS (HOLO)
I used the stones to destroy the 
stones.  The work is done.  It 
always will be...

HE STEPS FORWARD, FINISHING HIS OWN THOUGHT.

THANOS (HOLO) (CONT'D)
I AM INEVITABLE-
THANOS (CONT'D)
I AM INEVITABLE.

Thanos nods to Maw, who freezes the program.  THANOS WALKS 
THROUGH THE HOLOGRAM, STUDYING THE HEROES.

GAMORA
What did you do to them?

THANOS
Nothing.  Yet.
(piecing it together)
(MORE)

87


THANOS (CONT'D)

88

They’re not trying to stop 
something I’m going to do in our 
time.  They’re trying to undo 
something I’ve already done in 
theirs.

GAMORA
(uneasy)
The stones.  

THANOS
I found them all.  I won.  Tipped 
the cosmic scales to balance.

EBONY MAW
Sire.  This is your future?

THANOS
My destiny.  

He stares, mind whirling.  He nods.  THE MEMORY RESUMES.

RHODEY (HOLO)
He’s lying. 

NEBULA (O.S.)
My father is many things.  A liar 
is not one of them.

THANOS (HOLO)
Thank you, daughter.  Perhaps I’ve 
treated you too-

WHUMP.  THOR CUTS OFF THANOS’ HEAD.  THE VIEW LINGERS AS 
“NEBULA” STARES AT HER DEAD FATHER.  

THANOS STUDIES HIS SEVERED HEAD...AND SMILES.

THANOS (CONT'D)
And that is destiny fulfilled.

Gamora stares, torn.  But Ebony Maw fumes on Thanos’ behalf.

EBONY MAW
Sire.  Your daughter is a traitor.

EBONY MAW GESTURES: CABLES WRAP AROUND NEBULA’S NECK.  SHE 
AWAKENS, PANICKED.  She looks up at Thanos.

BAD NEBULA
(choking)
No.  Please, father.  That’s not 
me.  I would never betray you.  
Please-

THANOS (CONT'D)

88


89

Thanos UNWRAPS the cord.  He touches his daughter’s face.

THANOS
Ssh, child.  I know.  And you’ll 
have the chance to prove it...

INT. MORAG, TEMPLE VAULT - DAY (GUARDIANS)

ZZZT.  ON THE FLOOR, NEBULA’S EYES SNAP OPEN, HORRIFIED.

NEBULA
He knows...

EXT. MORAG - DAY (GUARDIANS)

BOOTS POUND ACROSS THE ROCKS.  NEBULA RUNS FLAT OUT, 
DESPERATE, HEADING FOR THE ESCAPE POD. 

INT. ESCAPE POD - DAY (GUARDIANS)

NEBULA rushes to the console and opens A COMMUNICATION LINK.

NEBULA (INTO COM)
Barton, Romanoff, come in.  We have 
a problem.  Thanos knows!  Thanos-

Suddenly, A SHADOW falls over the Pod.  Nebula looks out the 
cockpit window...

AS A TRACTOR BEAM PULLS THE ENTIRE POD SKYWARD.

EXT. NEW YORK CITY, ALLEY - (AVENGERS 1)

IN THE ALLEY, Steve drops down from the building.  He hears A 
WHISTLE.  TONY waves from behind a crashed car.

TONY
We’ve got a problem.

TIME CUT:

STEVE huddles with TONY and SCOTT. 

STEVE
How could you lose it?

TONY
What do you want?  I got hit in the 
head with a Hulk!

89


90

SCOTT LANG
You said we only had one shot.  
This was our shot.  We shot it.  It 
was six stones or nothing!  Six 
stones-

TONY
You’re not helping-

SCOTT LANG
You ruined the Time Heist!  

TONY
Okay, okay, Loki’s from Asgard, 
he’s comfortable there.  Knows the 
restaurants.  It’s a safe bet he 
visits home.  If we can just grab 
This-Thor and explain the 
situation, he and I can fly-

STEVE
Loki could be anywhere in the 
universe.  We’d be old men before 
we found him.

As Steve and Scott debate, MOVE IN ON TONY, MIND WHIRLING...

STEVE (CONT'D)
What other options did we have on 
the Tesseract?  

SCOTT LANG
Whoa, whoa.  We don’t have any 
other options.  We can’t go to any 
other times.  No do-overs!  We’ve 
only got one particle left, each.  
Use it now, that’s it, bye-bye, we 
don’t come home.

STEVE
But if we don’t try, nobody else 
comes home, either.  

TONY
I got it!  There’s another way to 
re-take the Tesseract, and acquire 
new particles.  
(to Steve)
Military installation, Garden 
State.

Steve eyes Tony, BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND.

90


91

STEVE
When were they both there?

TONY
I have a vaguely exact idea. 

STEVE
How vague?

SCOTT LANG
Hang on, what’s in New Jersey?  

TONY
I know they were there, and I know 
how I know.

STEVE STUDIES TONY A LONG MOMENT...

STEVE
Looks like we’re improvising.  

SCOTT LANG
Wait!  What are you improvising?

STEVE HANDS SCOTT THE STAFF.

STEVE
Scott, take this back to the 
Compound.  

TONY
All right, suits on.  Try these 
coordinates. 04-07-19-70... 

SCOTT LANG
Steve- Cap- Captain America, if you 
do this and he’s wrong...you’re not 
coming back.

Steve and Tony let the weight of that sink in.  He’s right.  
Even so, Tony turns to Steve.

TONY
You trust me?

STEVE
I do.

THEY STARE AT EACH OTHER, THEN...CLICK.  THEY BOTH HIT THEIR 
CUFFS.  TONY AND STEVE SHRINK TO NOTHING...

91


92

EXT. NEW JERSEY WOODS - DAY (1970)

CUE MUSIC: “HEY LAWDY MAMA,” STEPPENWOLF.

A 1970 Oldsmobile motors down a wooded road.  The bumper 
sticker reads: “NUFF SAID.”

At the wheel, STAN LEE (48), LONG HAIR, MOUSTACHE, OPEN 
SHIRT, sings along to the radio, TWO LADIES at his side.

He passes by AN ARMY BASE, throwing a peace sign to A GUARD.

STAN LEE
Make love, not war, baby!

He roars off, passing A FADED SIGN: “U.S. ARMY - CAMP LEHIGH - 
BIRTHPLACE OF CAPTAIN AMERICA.”  MOVE INTO THE BASE...

TONY (O.S.)
You weren’t actually born here, 
right?

EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970)

SOLDIERS MARCH PAST AS...

Tony and Steve round the corner, TONY IN A LAB COAT and STEVE 
IN GREEN KHAKIS, LOW-PULLED CAP, AND MIRRORED SUNGLASSES.

STEVE
The idea of me was.

TONY
(looking around)
All right.  If I was SHIELD and I 
wanted to hide my quasi-fascistic 
black site, where would I hide it?

STEVE
In plain sight.

Steve nods at A MAN IN A GRAY SUIT approaching a building, 
“MUNITIONS.”  He opens the door with a retro-tech PUNCH CARD. 

TONY TOUCHES HIS GLASSES: HE X-RAYS INTO THE GROUND, 
ILLUMINATING...TWENTY FLOORS OF SECRET, UNDERGROUND BASE.

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, ELEVATOR - DAY (1970)

Muzak plays as STEVE and TONY ride down with A FEMALE SHIELD 
AGENT.

92


93

She stares awkwardly at Tony.  Steve keeps his hat down.   
Ding.  The doors open.  Tony exits, then turns back to Steve.

TONY
Good luck with that mission, 
Captain.

STEVE
Good luck with your project, 
Doctor.

Tony ducks out.  The doors close.  The Agent turns to Steve.

FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
You new here?

STEVE
Not exactly.

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, ARCHIVES - DAY (1970)

TONY searches HIGH, CROWDED ARCHIVE SHELVES.

TONY
Come on, you little hexahedron, 
where are you hiding?

Finally, he spots A HIGH TECH SAFE.  He grabs a briefcase, 
then NANOS A GAUNTLET, FRYING THE SAFE’S LOCK.  

It opens revealing...THE TESSERACT.  Tony smiles.

TONY (CONT'D)
You may not know it now, but 
someday you’re going to be a real 
pain-in-the-ass.

Just then...THE ARCHIVE DOOR OPENS.

HOWARD STARK (O.S.)
Hey, Arnim, you in here?

TONY LOCKS THE CUBE IN THE BRIEFCASE JUST BEFORE...

HOWARD STARK (49) APPEARS, carrying ROSES AND A CAN OF 
SAUERKRAUT.  TONY STARES, STUNNED.

HOWARD STARK (CONT'D)
Hey, I’m looking for Dr. Zola.  You 
seen him?

TONY
No.  Haven’t seen a soul.

93


94

Tony stands in front of his father, overwhelmed.  Howard 
looks at him, a bit suspicious. 

HOWARD STARK
I know you?  

From his pocket, TONY GENERATES A BADGE OUT OF NANO-TECH.   
  
He holds it out.

TONY
No, sir.  Just visiting from MIT.  

HOWARD STARK
That so?  Got a name?  

TONY
Howard...

HOWARD STARK
Easy to remember-

TONY
Potts.

HOWARD STARK
I’m Howard Stark.
(shaking hands)
You seem a little green around the 
gills, Potts.  Need some air? 

TONY
That’d be swell. 

Tony distractedly walks away, leaving the briefcase.  

HOWARD STARK
Need the briefcase? 

PRE-LAP A RINGING PHONE...

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PYM’S LAB - DAY (1970)

CLOSE ON: AN ANT.  A phone continues to ring.  Then...

HANK PYM (O.S.)
Hello?

PULL BACK: THE ANT CRAWLS IN AN ANTFARM ON A LAB SHELF.

STEVE (OVER PHONE)
Dr. Pym?

94


95

HANK PYM (O.S.)
That would be the number you 
called, yes.

PAN across the shelf to A CHART OF WASP MATURATION.

STEVE (OVER PHONE)
This is Captain Stevens, from 
shipping.  We have a package for 
you.

KEEP PANNING to A PROTOTYPE ANT-MAN HELMET.

HANK PYM (O.S.)
So bring it up.

STEVE (OVER PHONE)
That’s the thing, sir, we can’t.

ARRIVE ON...HANK PYM (20’s), in brown hair and lab coat.

HANK PYM
Maybe I’m confused.  Isn’t that 
your job?

STEVE (OVER PHONE)
It’s just...sir, the box is 
glowing.  And to be honest, a 
couple of our mail guys aren’t 
feeling great-

HANK PYM
They didn’t open it, did they?!

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY (1970)

A DOOR MARKED, “DR. HENRY PYM,” flies open.  Hank exits, 
fuming, brushing past...STEVE.

Steve watches Hank stalk off...THEN DUCKS INTO HANK’S LAB.

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, ELEVATOR - DAY (1970)

HOWARD and TONY step onto AN ELEVATOR.  The doors shut.

TONY
Sauerkraut and a bouquet...big 
night planned? 

95


96

HOWARD STARK
(lifting one at a time)
My wife’s expecting.  And too much 
time at the office.

Tony puzzles the dates out in his head...

TONY
Congratulations.

HOWARD STARK
Thanks.

TONY
How far along is she?

HOWARD STARK
Gee, I suppose...
(indicating)
...this far.  She’s at the point 
where she can’t stand the sound of 
my chewing.  So I guess I’ll be 
eating in the pantry again.

TONY
I have a little girl.

TONY SMILES.  He’s talking about the man-he’s-talking-to’s 
granddaughter, fifty years before she’s born.

HOWARD STARK
A girl would be nice.  Less chance 
she’d turn out exactly like me. 

TONY
Would that be so bad?

HOWARD STARK
Let’s just say the greater good 
hasn’t always outweighed my own  
self interest.  

The elevator doors open.

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PYM’S LAB - DAY (1970)

STEVE searches Hank’s lab, finally opening the fridge to 
find...A TRAY OF BRAND NEW PYM PARTICLES.

96


97

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, HALLWAY - DAY (1970)

Steve exits Hank’s lab and heads for the elevator.  But it 
opens, revealing THE FEMALE AGENT FROM EARLIER, WITH AN M.P.  

M.P.
You’ve never seen either of these 
men before?

FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
No.  But I have an eye for this. 
Something looked fishy.

M.P.
Describe ‘fishy’.

FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
One of them had a hippie beard.

M.P.
We talking Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

FEMALE SHIELD AGENT
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

M.P.
(over walkie-talkie)
This is Chesler.  We need every 
available agent to sub-level 6.  We 
have a potential breach.

Steve ducks through the nearest door...

INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PEGGY’S OFC. - DAY (1970)

Steve enters a darkened office.  A glass wall separates it 
from another bullpen.

Then he sees something on the desk.  He stares, stunned, at 
two photos: one features PEGGY CARTER STANDING WITH JFK. 

THE OTHER IS OF SKINNY STEVE.

Steve turns the desk nameplate around: “MARGARET CARTER.”

Steve realizes that even twenty-five years later, Peggy never 
forgot about him.  

Just then, THE BULLPEN DOOR FLIES OPEN.  LIGHTS SNAP ON, 
revealing PEGGY CARTER (49), talking to someone in the hall.

PEGGY CARTER
So, send them in.

97


98

MALE AGENT
They’re trying, ma’am, but 
Braddock’s unit has been stopped by 
lightning strikes.

PEGGY CARTER
Oh, for the love of- I’ll find the 
weather projections.  You call 
Braddock and tell him to shelter in 
place.  Assuming he’s bright enough 
to come out of the rain. 

MALE AGENT (O.S.)
Yes, ma’am. 

Steve stares at her from the darkness, STUNNED.

Peggy rifles through a file cabinet.

PEGGY CARTER
Here we are...

She flips through a file, reading.  In the darkness behind 
her, Steve approaches.  Peggy reads something disturbing.

PEGGY CARTER (CONT'D)
Crikey O’Reilly.
(calling out)
Sergeant?  Hang up and call Air 
Command.  Braddock needs back up, 
immediately.

MALE AGENT
Ma’am?

PEGGY CARTER
Those aren’t lightning strikes he’s 
looking at...

She slaps the file closed and hurries out.  

Steve stares after her a long moment.

EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970)

Howard and Tony approach a WAITING LIMO. 

TONY
Got any names, yet?

HOWARD STARK
If it’s a boy, my wife likes 
Elmonzo. 

98


99

TONY
You might let that stew a while. 
You’ve got time. 

HOWARD STARK
What are you, couple years older 
than me?

TONY
Yeah.  I guess.

HOWARD STARK
Let me ask you a question.  When 
your kid was born...were you 
nervous?  

TONY
Wildly.

HOWARD STARK
Did you feel qualified?  Like you 
had any idea how to successfully 
operate that thing?

TONY
I pieced it together as I went 
along.  I thought about what my dad 
did...

HOWARD STARK
My old man never met a problem he 
couldn’t solve with a belt.

TONY
I tried to hold onto the good 
stuff.  Dad dropped the odd pearl, 
here and there.

HOWARD STARK
Like what?

TONY
“No amount of money ever bought a 
second of time.”  

HOWARD STARK
That’s good.  Smart guy.

TONY
He did his best.

99


100

HOWARD STARK
I tell you, this kid’s not even 
here yet, but there’s nothing I 
wouldn’t do for him.

Tony takes this in, GRATIFIED.  Just then...EDWIN JARVIS (56) 
opens the limo door.

HOWARD STARK (CONT'D)
Besides, if I fall down on the 
fathering job, old Jarvis is ready 
to pick up the slack.  Isn’t that 
right?

EDWIN JARVIS
Indeed, sir.  I shall endeavor to 
teach the lad the rudiments of 
judo.

Tony smiles at his old friend.  As Jarvis gets in the car, 
Tony notices...STEVE WAITING BEHIND A JEEP.  TIME TO GO. 

Howard turns to shake Tony’s hand.

HOWARD STARK
Well, good to meet you, Potts.

TONY
You’re going to do fine, Howard.

HOWARD STARK
Thanks.  See you around?

TONY
Count on it...

As he gets into his car, Howard looks to Jarvis.

HOWARD STARK
Have we met him before?

EDWIN JARVIS
We’ve met a lot of people, sir.

HOWARD STARK
Seems very familiar.  
(beat)
Weird beard.

EXT. SANCTUARY 2 - SPACE

INT. SANCTUARY-2, PRISON CELL - DAY

WHACK!  NEBULA GOES TUMBLING ACROSS THE FLOOR.  She gets to 
her knees, looking up at...BAD NEBULA, GLARING DOWN AT HER. 

BAD NEBULA
You’re weak.

NEBULA
I’m you-

BAD NEBULA
Shut up!

BAD NEBULA PUNCHES GOOD NEBULA DOWN.  GOOD NEBULA GROANS AS 
BAD NEBULA RIPS OFF HER TIME-SPACE GPS.

THEN GAMORA ENTERS.  Nebula softens, taking in her (once 
dead) sister.

NEBULA
You could stop this.  You know you 
want to.  
(off Gamora’s look)
Did you see what happens in the 
future?  Thanos finds the Soul 
Stone.

MOVE IN ON GAMORA, WHEELS TURNING...  

NEBULA (CONT'D)
You want to know how he does that?  
You want to know what he does to 
you-

BAD NEBULA
ENOUGH!

BAD NEBULA SMACKS HER THE HARDEST YET, THEN LEANS IN WITH A 
JAGGED INSTRUMENT OF TORTURE.  

BAD NEBULA (CONT'D)
You disgust me...but that doesn’t 
mean you’re useless.

SHE PRIES OFF THE ORANGE PANEL FROM GOOD NEBULA’S HEAD. 

Gamora takes in this new development...

INT. SANCTUARY-2, THRONE ROOM - DAY

Bad Nebula enters to find Thanos on his throne.  She hands 
him Good Nebula’s TIME-SPACE GPS.  He smiles.

Bad Nebula affixes Good Nebula’s orange panel onto her head.

BAD NEBULA
How do I look?

EXT. BENATAR - SPACE

THE BENATAR approaches Vormir.

TITLE: VORMIR, 2014

INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - SPACE 

NATASHA and CLINT stand on the flight deck, staring at THE 
MAJESTIC, PURPLE PLANET.

CLINT BARTON
Under different circumstances, this 
would be totally awesome.

EXT. VORMIR - DAY

Clint and Natasha eye THE BENATAR resting on a sand dune.  
Clint fires a Pym Particle.

WHOOSH, THE ENTIRE SHIP DISAPPEARS.  CLINT lifts THE SHRUNKEN 
BENATAR and tucks it in his pocket.  

CLINT AND NATASHA TREK ACROSS THE DUNES OF VORMIR, 
TOWARD...THE MOUNTAIN.

EXT. VORMIR, MIDWAY UP THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

Natasha and Clint climb, ragged.  They approach AN ARCHWAY.  

CLINT BARTON
Really starting to regret my choice 
here.

NATASHA
Yeah.  I’m gonna bet the raccoon 
didn’t have to climb a mountain.  

CLINT BARTON
I don’t think technically he’s a 
raccoon...

NATASHA
Whatever.  He eats garbage-

102


103

THEY HEAR SOMETHING.  THEY WHIRL, WEAPONS UP.  A HOODED 
FIGURE APPROACHES.   

HOODED FIGURE 
I assure you, you have nothing to 
fear from me.

CLINT BARTON
Creepy.

HOODED FIGURE
Welcome Natasha, daughter of Ivan.  
Clint, son of Edith.  

CLINT BARTON
Creepier.

NATASHA
Who are you?

RED SKULL
Consider me a guide.  To you, and 
to all who seek the Soul Stone. 

NATASHA
Great.  You show us where it is, 
and we’ll be on our way.

The figure removes his hood, revealing...THE RED SKULL. 

RED SKULL
Oh, liebchen.  If only it were that 
easy...

EXT. VORMIR, MOUNTAIN TOP - DAY   

START ON JAGGED ROCKS.  TILT UP TO SEE SKULL, NATASHA, and 
CLINT staring down from the ALTAR.

RED SKULL
What you seek lies in front of you.  
As does what you fear.

NATASHA
The Stone is down there?

RED SKULL
For one of you.  For the other...
(smiling it away)
The Stone demands a sacrifice.  In 
order to take it, you must leave 
behind that which you love.

SKULL POINTS A BONY FINGER DOWN THE WELL.

RED SKULL (CONT'D)
A soul for a soul.  

Natasha and Clint stare down the well, stunned.

TIME CUT:

RED SKULL STARES DOWN THE WELL, robes whipping in the wind.  

CLINT BARTON (O.S.)
Maybe he’s full of shit.  

FIFTY FEET AWAY, AT THE MONOLITHS, NATASHA AND CLINT HUDDLE.

NATASHA
I don’t think so.

CLINT BARTON
Why, because he knew your daddy’s 
name?

NATASHA
I didn’t.
(off his look)
Thanos left here with the stone,  
and without his daughter.  You 
really think that’s a coincidence?

They both look out at the well, heavy. 

NATASHA (CONT'D)
(under her breath)
Whatever it takes...

CLINT BARTON
(under his breath)
Whatever it takes...

Natasha goes to Clint, resolved.

NATASHA
If we don’t get the stone, billions 
of people are going to stay dead.

CLINT BARTON
Then I guess we both know who it 
has to be.

NATASHA
Yeah.  Guess we do.

They take each other’s hand.  A long goodbye beat.  Except...

104


105

CLINT BARTON
I’m starting to think we don’t mean 
the same person.

NATASHA
For the last five years, I’ve been 
trying to do one thing -- get to 
right here.  This is all it’s been 
about.  Bringing everybody back. 

CLINT BARTON
Do not get all decent on me- 

NATASHA
You think I want to do it?  I’m 
trying to save your life, you idiot-

CLINT BARTON
And I don’t want you to.
(beat)
Nat.  You know what I’ve done.  
What I am now.  Your life’s worth 
ten of mine-

NATASHA
I don’t judge people by their worst 
mistakes-

CLINT BARTON
Maybe you should-

NATASHA
You didn’t.

That stops him.  He looks in her eyes, then down, giving in.  

CLINT BARTON
You’re a pain in my ass, you know 
that?

She relaxes for the briefest moment.  Just then, CLINT SWEEPS 
OUT HER LEGS, PINNING HER DOWN.

CLINT BARTON (CONT'D)
Tell my family I love them.

SHE REVERSES, SENDING HIM TUMBLING.

NATASHA
Tell them yourself.

SHE FIRES A WIDOW’S BITE INTO HIS CHEST AND MAKES A BREAK FOR 
THE CLIFF.  SHE’S HALFWAY THERE WHEN...

105

---


106

BOOM!  AN EXPLODING ARROW KNOCKS HER OFF HER FEET.  

Clint races past her...leaping off edge of the cliff.  Just 
as he falls...

NATASHA TACKLES HIM IN MID-AIR.  They drop, but NATASHA 
SHOOTS HER GRAPPLING LINE INTO THE CLIFF.

THEY SLAM INTO THE CLIFFSIDE.  She attaches the other end of 
her grappling line to Clint’s belt...saving his life.  

She slides, but he reaches out and grabs her...saving hers.

CLINT BARTON
Damn you.

They hang there a long, terrible moment.  CLINT’S GRASP 
STARTS TO LOOSEN.  Finally, she looks him in the eye.

NATASHA
Let me go.

CLINT BARTON
No.  Please no...

The two friends stare at each other, a lifetime between them.

NATASHA
It’s okay...

CLINT BARTON
Natasha, no-

Then Natasha Romanoff kicks off the cliff wall, yanking out 
of Clint’s grasp.

She falls...  

Clint dangles from the grappling hook, staring down, 
helpless, stifling his scream.  

WHOOSH!  THE WHOLE WORLD GOES WHITE.

EXT. VORMIR, BOTTOM OF THE MOUNTAIN - DAY

When the light fades, CLINT LIES FLOATING IN SPACE.  The 
camera rotates until we see...IT’S A REFLECTION OF THE SKY.

CLINT LIES IN THE POOL AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN.  He sits 
up and opens his hand to see THE SOUL STONE.  His eyes well.  

106


107

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

THE PENCIL FINALLY CLATTERS TO A STOP AS... WHOOSH, CLINT 
GROWS INTO THE PRESENT ALONGSIDE THE OTHERS:

SMART HULK HOLDS THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO, SCOTT HAS THE SCEPTER, 
RHODEY THE ORB, ROCKET & THOR THE EXTRACTION DEVICE, AND TONY 
& STEVE THE TESSERACT.  NEBULA RETRACTS HER TIME SUIT.

Everyone looks around, exhausted.  Amazed.

RHODEY
Are you telling me that actually 
worked?

SMART HULK
Did we get them all?

CLINT DROPS TO HIS KNEES.  Steve turns, concerned.

STEVE
Clint?  Are you okay?

Clint stares, haunted.  SMART HULK realizes...

SMART HULK 
Where’s Nat?  
(everyone stares)
WHERE’S NAT?!

Clint looks up at them, eyes glassy.  

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVER - DAWN

SMART HULK, eyes red, stands beside a bench on the dock.  
Behind him, STEVE, TONY, THOR, AND CLINT STARE OUT, GRIEVING.

TONY
Do we know if she had family?

STEVE
Yeah.  Us.

Thor turns, thrown.

THOR
Why are you doing that?

TONY
I’m just asking a question-

107


108

THOR
Why are we talking as if she’s 
dead?  We have the stones.  Bring 
her back.  C’mon, stop this shit.

Clint squeezes away tears.

CLINT BARTON
We can’t get her back.  

THOR
What’s he talking about?  Of 
course, we can.  

CLINT BARTON
It can’t be undone.  That’s why. 

THOR
No offense, but you’re...a very 
earthly being.  We’re talking about 
space magic, here.  “Can’t” seems a 
little definitive, don’t you think?

CLINT BARTON
Well, I know I’m a little outside 
my pay grade here, but, she still 
isn’t here, is she? 

THOR
That’s my point-

CLINT BARTON
It can’t be undone.  At least 
that’s what the red, floating guy 
said.  But why don’t you go talk to 
him, okay?  Why don’t you grab your 
hammer and fly to that place and 
talk to him.  IT CAN’T BE UNDONE. 
(beat)
It was supposed to be me.  She 
sacrificed her life for that 
goddamn stone.  She bet her life on 
it.

That lands heavily on all of them.  A moment passes.

THEN SMART HULK HURLS THE BENCH INTO THE WATER.  It skips 
across the surface like a stone.  

SMART HULK
She’s not coming back.  We have to 
make it worth it.  We have to.

108


109

STEVE
We will.

PULL BACK, LEAVING OUR MOURNERS IN TABLEAU...

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

ALL SIX INFINITY STONES rest behind safety glass.  SOON, 
ROBOTIC ARMS ENTER FRAME, PLUCKING UP THE POWER STONE.  

TONY operates the arms as ROCKET and SMART HULK watch.

The robot arms swing the stone over to...A NEW IRON MAN 
GAUNTLET.  NANO-TECH SHIFTS AND SLIDES, HOLDING IT IN PLACE.

Smart Hulk releases a deep breath.

TIME CUT:

THE COMPLETED GAUNTLET sits in a cradle, SIX INFINITY STONES 
EMBEDDED IN THE BACK.  Pull back to find...

SCOTT, THOR, CLINT, RHODEY, and STEVE watching TONY AND 
ROCKET FINE TUNE THE GLOVE.

ROCKET
All right.  The glove’s ready.  
Question is, who’s gonna snap their 
freaking fingers?

Everyone stares a beat.  Then, THOR REACHES FOR THE GAUNTLET.

THOR
I’ll do it.  

TONY
Whoa, whoa, what are you doing-

STEVE
Thor, we haven’t decided who’s 
putting that on.

THOR
Oh.  Were all of you just waiting 
for the right opportunity?

ROCKET
Maybe I was getting around to it-

SCOTT LANG
We should at least discuss it-

109


110

THOR
Staring at the thing isn’t going to 
bring everybody back, is it?  Look, 
I’m the strongest Avenger.  It’s my 
responsibility.  Fate wills it so.

TONY
Hold on, hold on-  

THOR
Stop it!  Let me do this.  Let me 
do something good.  Something right-

TONY
That thing is channeling enough 
energy to light up a continent. 
You’re in no condition-

THOR
What do you think is coursing 
through my veins right now?

RHODEY
Cheez Whiz?

THOR
Lightning.

Smart Hulk steps toward the Gauntlet.

SMART HULK
Lightning won’t help you, pal.  
It’s gotta be me.
(approaching)
You saw what those stones did to 
Thanos.  They almost killed him.  
None of you could survive.

STEVE
And how do we know you can?

SMART HULK
We don’t.  But the radiation’s 
mostly gamma.  
(beat)
It’s like I was made for this...

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

THE QUANTUM TUNNEL LIES IN DARKNESS.  Then, clack, the lights 
come on, revealing...

NEBULA, STARING UP AT THE WAITING MACHINE.

110

111

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

SMART HULK STUDIES THE GAUNTLET.  The moment of truth.

TONY
Good to go?

SMART HULK
Let’s do it.

TONY
Okay, remember, everyone Thanos 
snapped away five years ago, you’re 
just bringing them back...to today.  
Don’t change anything from the last 
five years.  Got it?  

SMART HULK
Got it.  

PAN AROUND as the Avengers ready themselves:  

STEVE steps forward, shield on his arm.  SCOTT deploys his 
helmet.  RHODEY readies his repulsors. 

ROCKET covers his raccoon junk and hides behind THOR.  TONY 
armors up, then nanos a shield to protect CLINT beside him. 

TONY
Friday, why don’t you go ahead and 
activate Barn Door Protocol?

STEEL DOORS SLIDE SHUT ALL AROUND THE WORKSHOP.

FINALLY, SMART HULK HOLDS UP THE GAUNTLET.

SMART HULK
(under his breath)
Everybody’s coming home...  

HE SLOWLY SLIPS HIS HAND IN THE GLOVE.  SUDDENLY, HE SPASMS, 
TAKING IN THE POWER AS THANOS DID IN ML1.  HE STRUGGLES.  

THOR
What’s happening?  Take it off, 
take if off!

STEVE
Bruce, you okay?  

TONY
Talk to me, Banner. 

111


112

SMART HULK
I’m...okay... 

THEN SMART HULK REACHES OUT HIS HAND...AND SNAPS HIS FINGERS.

CRAAAACK!  THE STONES FLARE.  A BRIGHT SURGE OF ENERGY RACES 
UP SMART HULK’S ARM.  HE ROARS AS HIS EYES BLAZE GREEN.

A BLAST WHITES OUT THE SCREEN.  

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY

NEBULA studies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE.  She takes off her glove, 
revealing A PERFECTLY INTACT ARM.  THIS IS BAD NEBULA.

SHE OPENS A PANEL IN HER ARM, SNAKES OUT A CABLE...AND JACKS 
INTO THE CONSOLE.  THE QUANTUM TUNNEL boots up. 

AS SHE HURRIES AWAY...

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY

FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE SEE THE TIME ENERGY SIGNATURE SHOOT 
FROM THE HANGAR.  AN OMINOUS RIPPLE WARPS ACROSS THE SKY...

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY

WHOOSH!  EVERYTHING COMES BACK INTO VIEW.  THE GAUNTLET FALLS 
OFF, ROLLING ACROSS THE FLOOR.

SMART HULK COLLAPSES, ARM WITHERED, SIDE BURNT BLACK. 
EVERYONE RUSHES OVER.  Steve checks Smart Hulk’s pulse.

STEVE
Bruce!

TONY
Don’t move him! 

Then THE BLAST DOORS OPEN, revealing the sound of...CHIRPING.  
SCOTT walks toward the courtyard.

Smart Hulk’s eyes clear.  He grasps Steve’s arm.

SMART HULK
Did it work?

They pause, as if it only just now occurred to them.  

JUST THEN...A CELL PHONE BUZZES.  

112


113

A STUNNED CLINT TURNS AND APPROACHES HIS PHONE.  On the home 
screen, we see A PHOTO OF HIS WIFE: “LAURA CALLING.”

CLINT FINALLY PUTS THE PHONE TO HIS EAR. 

CLINT BARTON
Honey?

AT THE WINDOW, SCOTT STARES AT A BIRD FEEDER.  DOZENS OF 
CARDINALS AND FINCHES NIBBLE ON THE SEED.

SCOTT LANG
Guys, I think it-

BOOM!  THE BUILDING EXPLODES.  DEBRIS SWALLOWS THE CAMERA.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY

A MUSHROOM CLOUD BILLOWS OVER AVENGERS COMPOUND.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY

Nothing moves.  The smoke clears, revealing...A BOMBED OUT 
CRATER A MILE WIDE.  Avengers Compound has been destroyed.  

Then the light changes...AND THE SANCTUARY-2 parts the 
clouds.  It hovers over the ruins like a vulture.

AN ENERGY BEAM drops to the ground, releasing...

THANOS, FLANKED BY A SQUAD OF OUTRIDERS.  The Mad Titan looks 
around at the devastation he has wrought.  

THANOS (INTO COM)
Daughter?  

BAD NEBULA (OVER COM)
Yes, father...

OUT OF THE SMOKE WALKS ”BAD” NEBULA.  Bruised and dirty. 

THANOS
So this is the future.  Well done.  

She tears off THE ORANGE HEAD-PLATE.

BAD NEBULA
Thank you, Father.  They suspected 
nothing. 

THANOS
The arrogant never do.

113


114

Thanos takes off his helmet, staring up at the crater’s edge.

THANOS (CONT'D)
Go.  Find the stones.  Bring them 
to me.

BAD NEBULA
What will you do?

THANOS
Wait.

INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY

THE UNDERGROUND GARAGE LIES HALF-COLLAPSED.

SMART HULK GRITS HIS TEETH, HOLDING UP THE CEILING WITH ONE 
GOOD ARM, HIS OTHER ARM BURNED AND LIFELESS.  BELOW... 

RHODEY LIES IN THE RUBBLE, WAR MACHINE SUIT SPARKING. 

RHODEY
Canopy!  Canopy!

Rhodey’s suit RATCHETS OPEN.  HE HAULS HIMSELF FREE to 
see...ROCKET TRAPPED UNDER RUBBLE.  AS HE CRAWLS TO HIM...  

THE CEILING RUMBLES.  SMART HULK WAVERS, MUSCLES QUIVERING. 

RHODEY (INTO COM) (CONT'D)
Mayday!  Tony.  Cap.  Does anybody 
hear me?!

HE FINALLY REACHES ROCKET.  Rocket wheezes, in pain.

RHODEY (CONT'D)
Hang on!

RHODEY WEDGES A PIECE OF REBAR INTO THE DEBRIS.  HE HEAVES, 
finally managing to lever it off of Rocket.  THEN... 

THE CRACKED CEILING GIVES WAY.  A MILLION GALLONS OF RIVER 
WATER RUSH IN.  RHODEY TRIES TO KEEP HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER.  

RHODEY (INTO COM) (CONT'D)
Mayday!  Mayday!  We are taking on 
water!

INT. TOOL SHOP, RUINS - DAY

CLOSE ON SCOTT LANG lying on a SILVER, METAL FLOOR.

114


115

RHODEY (OVER COM)
...anyone...Mayday...Mayday-

Scott groans, coming to.

SCOTT LANG
Wait, what...?

REVEAL, TINY SCOTT LYING IN THE RUINS OF THE ARMORY...ON THE 
IRON PATRIOT HELMET. 

ROCKET (OVER COM)
Tell ‘em to...hurry...asses up-

RHODEY (OVER COM)
...trapped...drowning...no time...

Scott jumps to his feet.

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
No!  Wait, I’m here!

Scott spots WATER TRICKLING THROUGH THE CRACKED FLOOR.

INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - DAY

WATER DRIPS FROM A HOLE IN THE ROOF OF AN ACCESS 
TUNNEL...ONTO CLINT BARTON, LYING FACEDOWN.  He groans.  

He opens his hand to find HIS CELLPHONE: HIS WIFE SMILES ON 
THE SCREEN.  “LAURA, ONE MISSED CALL.”  Clint stares, amazed.  

He winces, finding he’s been lying atop...THE GAUNTLET.  It’s 
bashed out of shape, BUT ALL SIX STONES STILL GLEAM.

CLINT BARTON (INTO COM)
Cap?  Stark?  Anyone?

STATIC.  Then, he hears...A SCRAPING SOUND, TALONS ON CEMENT.  

He peers down a darkened tunnel, then unshoulders his bow.  
HE LOOSES A FLARE ARROW, revealing... 

DOZENS OF OUTRIDERS SCRABBLING ALONG THE WALLS AND CEILING.  
CLINT GRABS THE GAUNTLET AND RUNS.  THE CREATURES GIVE CHASE.

INT./EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LAB, RUINS - DAY

FIRES SMOULDER BENEATH THE COLLAPSED CEILING.  MOVE THROUGH 
SMOKE TO FIND...STEVE, out cold.  SOMEONE SHAKES HIM.  

He wakes to see TONY, HOLDING HIS SHIELD.

115


116

TONY
You lose this again, I’m keeping 
it.

STEVE
What happened?

TONY
Told you.  We messed with time.  
Time messed back.

Woozy, Steve follows Tony through the ruins of the lab.

STEVE
Where are the others?

TONY
I read life signs, maybe 800 feet 
down, but it’s hard to tell.  

They reach the edge of the crater where THOR LOOKS DOWN 
AT...THANOS.  Sitting on a rock.  Waiting.

TONY (CONT'D)
What’s he been doing?

THOR
Absolutely nothing.   

The three of them stare a long moment.  Then, as if sensing 
them, Thanos turns his head...AND LOOKS THEIR WAY.

STEVE
Son of a bitch.

TONY
Yeah.

STEVE
Where are the stones?

TONY
Somewhere under all of this.  All I 
know is...he doesn’t have ‘em.

STEVE
So we keep it that way.

That lands.  This is their chance.

THOR
You know it’s a trap.

TONY DEPLOYS HIS ARMOR.

116


(MORE)

117

TONY
Don’t think I care.

THOR
Just so we’re all in agreement.

Thor holds out his hand: MJOLNIR FLIES INTO IT.  He holds out 
his other hand: STORMBREAKER SLAPS INTO HIS PALM.

CRACK!  LIGHTNING STRIKES AS HE’S COVERED IN CAPE AND ARMOR.

THOR (CONT'D)
Let’s kill him properly this time.

STEVE TIGHTENS HIS SHIELD, LEADING THEM INTO THE CRATER...

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY

Thanos sits on his rock, contemplative.

THANOS
You could not live with your own 
failure.  And where did that bring 
you?  Right back to me.  

TONY APPROACHES, WARY, AS IF SNEAKING UP ON A RABID DOG.  
STEVE AND THOR FAN OUT ON EITHER SIDE.

THANOS (CONT'D)
I thought by eliminating half of 
life, the other half would thrive.  
But you’ve shown me that’s 
impossible.
(beat)
Life clings to the past with bloody 
fingernails.  As long as there are 
those who remember what was, there 
will be those unable to accept what 
can be.  They will resist.

TONY
Yep.  We’re all kinds of stubborn.

THANOS
I’m thankful.  Because now I know 
what I must do.

Thanos reaches for his helmet.

THANOS (CONT'D)
I will shred this universe down to 
its last atom.  
(MORE)

117


THANOS (CONT'D)

118

And then, with the stones you’ve 
collected for me, create a new one, 
teeming with life that knows not 
what it has lost, but only what it 
has been given.  A grateful 
universe.

STEVE
Born out of blood.

Thanos studies Steve as if seeing him for the first time.

THANOS
They’ll never know it.

THANOS DRAWS A BLADE OFF HIS BACK, TOWERING OVER THEM.

THANOS (CONT'D)
Because you won’t be alive to tell 
them.

Tony glances over at Steve.  Ready?  Steve nods...

JUST AS THOR CHARGES THANOS.  WHAM!  ALL THREE AVENGERS 
ATTACK, USING THEIR SKILLS IN CONCERT.

THANOS STUMBLES, ON HIS HEELS.  THE HEROES PUNISH HIM, 
RELENTLESS. 

PULL UP THROUGH THE HAZE, TO THE SANCTUARY-2...

INT. SANCTUARY-2, INTERROGATION CELL - DAY

NEBULA huddles alone in A PRISON CELL.  After a beat...THE 
DOORS RATCHET OPEN.  She stares into the shadows.

NEBULA
What do you want?

GAMORA STEPS INTO THE CELL.  THE TWO SISTERS FROM DIFFERENT 
ERAS STARE AT EACH OTHER.

GAMORA
In the future...what happens to you 
and me?

NEBULA
I try to kill you.  Several times.  
But, eventually...we become 
friends.  We become sisters.

GAMORA
That’s hard to believe.

THANOS (CONT'D)

118


119

NEBULA
A lot of things that happen will be 
hard to believe. 

Gamora nearly smiles.  She takes a long look at Nebula.  
Finally...SHE HOLDS OUT HER HAND.  

GAMORA
Come on.  We can still stop him.

Nebula takes a deciding moment.  Then SHE GRABS GAMORA’S 
HAND.  One sister pulls the other to her feet.

INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY

SMART HULK STRAINS AGAINST THE CEILING.  RHODEY HANGS ONTO A 
PIPE AS THE WATER RISES.

SMART HULK
Rhodey.  Rocket.  Get out of here. 
Save yourselves.

ROCKET SURFACES FROM BELOW, GASPING.

ROCKET
No good.  Couldn’t even...find a 
hole...small enough to abandon you 
through.

Suddenly, Smart Hulk snarls in pain as THE CEILING DROPS A 
FOOT.  His legs buckle as he struggles against the weight.  

Finally he sets his jaw...AND STRAIGHTENS HIS LEGS.  

SMART HULK
AAARRRGH!

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - CONTINUOUS

THE BUILDING RIGHTS ITSELF, LEVELING OUT. 

INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY

A RAGING RIVER ROARS THROUGH THE RUINS.  AFTER A BEAT...SCOTT 
LANG ZOOMS PAST, RIDING A PLASTIC BOTTLE CAP.  

RHODEY (OVER COM)
MAYDAY!  MAYDAY!

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
HANG ON!  I’M COMING!

119


120

INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - DAY

SHRIEKING OUTRIDERS CHASE BARTON THROUGH THE TUNNELS.  CLINT 
AFFIXES ARROW-CHARGES TO THE WALLS AS HE RUNS.  

Just as the Outriders are about to overtake him, Clint hits a 
button on his bow, DETONATING THE CHARGES...

BRINGING THE ROOF DOWN ON TOP OF THE OUTRIDERS.

Clint rolls, coming up directly underneath A VERTICAL SHAFT.

A cluster of Outriders escape the collapse, lunging for him.

Clint shoots a grappling arrow up the shaft, ascending...BUT 
SO DO THE OUTRIDERS, skittering up the sides.

Clint draws his katana, slashing the aliens just as...

INT. ACCESS TUNNEL, UPPER CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS

HE TUMBLES INTO THE UPPER CHAMBER.  He gasps, safe.  Then he 
looks up to see (BAD) NEBULA, LOOMING OVER HIM.

CLINT BARTON
Oh, hey.  I know you.

She gently takes the Gauntlet.

BAD NEBULA (INTO COM)
Father.  I have the stones.

CLINT BARTON
What-

Clint tries to get up, but Nebula puts a boot in his chest 
and A BLASTER TO HIS HEAD...

GAMORA (O.S.)
Stop.

COVERING CLINT, BAD NEBULA TURNS TO SEE...GAMORA, GUN RAISED.

BAD NEBULA
You’re betraying us?

GAMORA
Not you.

GOOD NEBULA steps from the shadows, hands raised, placating.  
Bad Nebula stares at her future self.

120


121

NEBULA
You don’t have to do this.  

BAD NEBULA
I am this.

GAMORA
No.  You’re not.

Good Nebula takes a tiny step forward.  She taps her head.

NEBULA
You’ve seen what we become-

GAMORA
Sister, listen to her-

BAD NEBULA
Shut up.  You’re a traitor!

NEBULA
You can change.

Bad Nebula struggles, her face a twisted grimace.

BAD NEBULA
He won’t let me.

BAD NEBULA FIRES AT GAMORA, JUST AS GOOD NEBULA DRAWS A GUN 
AND SHOOTS HER DOWN.  BAD NEBULA DROPS.

Good Nebula stares at her dead younger self, conflicted. 

Clint picks up the gauntlet, very confused.

CLINT BARTON
I’m not even gonna ask.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY

TONY’S HUD: TONY GLARES RIGHT AT US, AS...

THOR SMASHES HIS HAMMERS TOGETHER, HURLING LIGHTNING INTO THE 
BACK OF THE IRON MAN SUIT.

TONY SENDS THE RESULTING OVERLOAD AT THANOS...BUT THANOS 
PROPELLERS HIS BLADE, HOLDING BACK THE BLAST.

THOR USES STORMBREAKER TO BAT MJOLNIR AT THANOS...

THANOS SNATCHES TONY BY THE ANKLE  AND USES HIM AS A SHIELD 
AGAINST THE ONCOMING HAMMER.  WHACK! 

121


122

MJOLNIR PLOWS INTO THE DIRT.  TONY GOES TUMBLING, OUT COLD.

TONY’S HUD: FRIDAY TRIES TO REVIVE HIM.

FRIDAY (O.S.)
Boss?  Wake up!

INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY

ROCKET, RHODEY, AND SMART HULK GULP AIR, INCHES FROM THE 
CEILING, FACING THE END.  RHODEY GLANCES OVER AT SMART HULK.

RHODEY
See you on the other side, man.

They take a last breath, THEN THE WATER HITS THE CEILING.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY

Steve slashes at Thanos.  The Titan brutally bats him aside.  

Thor attacks, but Thanos drives him through walls of debris.  
THANOS SMASHES HIS FIST INTO THOR’S FACE, OVER AND OVER.

Thor calls for Stormbreaker, but Thanos intercepts it.  He 
presses the blade into Thor’s chest, trying to drive it home.

Then, across the field...MJOLNIR RISES INTO THE AIR.

THANOS GRINS, ABOUT TO FINISH THOR OFF, WHEN...MJOLNIR FLIES 
IN, KNOCKING THE AXE OUT OF HIS HAND.

Follow the hammer as it flies back to the only other man 
worthy enough to wield it...STEVE ROGERS.  

Half-conscious, THOR SEES STEVE HOLDING MJOLNIR.  

THOR
I...knew...it...

STEVE ATTACKS, CRACKING THANOS IN THE JAW.  THANOS TUMBLES.

BEFORE THE TITAN CAN GET UP, STEVE CALLS DOWN THE LIGHTNING 
AND SENDS IT CRACKLING INTO THANOS’ BODY.

Steve leaps, trying to finish Thanos off...BUT THANOS ROLLS 
ASIDE, HEAD-BUTTING STEVE BACKWARDS.

THANOS GETS TO HIS FEET, A FAINT SMILE ON HIS FACE.  

HE WHIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND ATTACKS STEVE WITH HIS BLADE.  
BLOW AFTER BLOW.  IT’S ALL STEVE CAN DO TO GET HIS SHIELD UP.  

122


123

THANOS HACKS THE SHIELD TO PIECES, FINALLY KNOCKING STEVE 
ACROSS THE FIELD. 

Steve lies beaten, half a shield still attached to his arm.

THANOS 
In all my years of conquest...

Thanos looks out at the tiny human struggling to stand.

THANOS (CONT'D)
Of violence and slaughter...it was 
never personal.

Thanos gestures behind him as A RUMBLE ECHOES.  

THOUSANDS OF ALIENS RING THE LIP OF THE CRATER: THE BLACK 
ORDER LEADS A PLATOON OF CHITAURI, SAKAARANS, AND OUTRIDERS.  

THANOS (CONT'D)
But I’ll tell you now, the things 
I’m about to do to your stubborn, 
annoying, little planet...

Q-SHIPS, DROPSHIPS, NECROCRAFT, AND LEVIATHANS BUZZ ABOVE.  

THANOS (CONT'D)
I’m going to enjoy it.  Very, very 
much.

Steve stares at Thanos and his army.  And even in the face of 
such overwhelming odds...he gets to his feet.

THANOS stares, almost sad, as Steve tightens the broken 
shield on his arm...AND STARTS WALKING TOWARD HIM.

One man against thousands.  All alone.

But just then, Steve’s COM CRACKLES.  He strains to hear.  
The com crackles again.  We can make out A MUFFLED VOICE.

MUFFLED VOICE (ON COM)
-ap-...-comin-...-ot-

Steve shakes his head, trying to clear it.  Slowly, SOUND 
RETURNS...AND THE WORDS RING CLEAR:

SAM WILSON (O.S.)
Cap.  On your left.

PULL BACK...TO SEE A PORTAL OPENING IN THE DISTANCE.  OUT OF 
IT FLIES...SAM WILSON.

123


124

Steve watches Sam soar over the field, then turns AS EVEN 
MORE PORTALS OPEN.

FROM ONE: DR. STRANGE, PETER QUILL, DRAX, MANTIS, PETER 
PARKER...AND KRAGLIN AND THE RAVAGERS.

FROM ANOTHER: T’CHALLA, OKOYE, SHURI, M’BAKU, WANDA, BUCKY, 
GROOT...AND THE WAKANDAN ARMY.

FROM A THIRD: VALKYRIE, KORG, MIEK...AND AN ASGARDIAN ARMY.

FROM A FOURTH: PEPPER POTTS (IN RESCUE ARMOR), HOPE VAN DYNE, 
AND WONG LEADING A SQUAD OF SORCERERS.

THOR gets to his feet, calling Stormbreaker to his hand 
as...TONY regains consciousness, staring out at the cavalry.

Wong and Strange quickly find each other.

DR. STRANGE
Is that everyone?

WONG
You wanted more?!

JUST THEN, THE GROUND SHAKES AND RUBBLE EXPLODES UPWARDS 
AS...GIANT-MAN BURSTS FROM BELOW.

SCOTT LANG
Top floor, everybody out!

HE OPENS HIS HUGE HAND, RELEASING ROCKET, SMART HULK, AND 
RHODEY, NOW IN HIS COSMIC IRON PATRIOT ARMOR.  

STEVE TAKES IN HIS REINFORCEMENTS, THEN STARES OUT AT THANOS.

PAN ACROSS OUR HEROES AS STEVE CALLS MJOLNIR TO HIS HAND.

STEVE
Avengers...assemble.

THOR LETS LOOSE A BATTLE CRY AS HE CHARGES!  EVERYONE FOLLOWS 
SUIT AS OUR HEROES FLOOD THE FIELD.  

ACROSS THE WAY, THANOS SMILES AND POINTS HIS BLADE.

TWO MIGHTY ARMIES RACE TOWARD EACH OTHER UNTIL...CLASH!  

GIANT-MAN SLUGS A LEVIATHAN IN THE JAW.  

DRAX launches himself onto a CULL currently choking the life 
out of KORG.

124


125

TONY blasts overhead.  RESCUE joins him.  Together, they 
strafe the field.  

STEVE and THOR fight together.  Both hold out their hands.  
Stormbreaker returns to Steve, Mjolnir to Thor, who frowns.

THOR
No.  You take the little one.

Elsewhere, TONY BATTLES SEVERAL CULLS.  One knocks him into 
an Outrider, who’s about to rip his armor off when...

THWIP.  PETER PARKER webs the Outrider, yanking him into the 
path of...GIANT-MAN’S FOOT.  SQUISH.

Tony stares at Peter, emotional.  They retract their helmets.

PETER PARKER
Mr. Stark.  Holy cow, you would not 
believe what’s been going on.  Do 
you remember when we were in space?  
And I got all dusty?  I must’ve 
passed out, because I woke up and 
you weren’t there, but Dr. Strange 
was, and he was like, “it’s been 
five years, they need us.”  And he 
started doing that yellow sparkly 
thing he does-

But Tony just wraps his arms around him, smashing Peter’s 
face into his chest plate.

PETER PARKER (CONT'D)
(muffled)
Oh.  This is nice. 

ACROSS THE FIELD...QUILL flies, firing down on Sakaaran 
soldiers.  One leaps off an outcropping...

TACKLING QUILL INTO A WRECKED FUSELAGE, WHERE ANOTHER 
SAKAARAN WAITS.

Quill drops one, but the other raises his weapon to strike.  
THEN BLAM!  The Sakaaran drops dead on top of Quill.

He pushes the body off to see...GAMORA, BLASTER STILL 
SMOKING.  Quill stares, amazed.

QUILL
Gamora?

HE APPROACHES, OVERWHELMED, EMOTIONAL. 

125


126

QUILL (CONT'D)
I thought I lost you.

He tenderly strokes her face...and she knees him in the nuts.  
Twice.  He goes down, gasping.

QUILL (CONT'D)
You missed the first time...then 
you got ‘em both the second time.

She stares down at him as...NEBULA JOINS HER.

GAMORA
This is the one?  Seriously?  

NEBULA
Your choices were him or a tree.

ACROSS THE FIELD...CLINT RUNS WITH THE GAUNTLET, PURSUED BY A 
CHITAURI APE.  Just before the ape tramples Clint...

SAM WILSON SWOOPS IN, CUTTING THE CREATURE DOWN.

Clint runs on.  The heroes confer over coms.

CLINT BARTON
What do you want to do with this 
thing? 

STEVE
Get those stones as far away as 
possible!

SMART HULK
No!  We need to send them back 
where they came from.

TONY
There’s no way to send them back.   
Thanos destroyed our time machine.

SCOTT LANG
Hold on! 
(shrinking to normal size)
That wasn’t our only time machine. 

He clicks the KEYS TO LUIS’ VAN.  From a distance, we hear, 
“LA CUCARACHA.”  Steve immediately gets it.

STEVE
Does anyone see an ugly, brown van 
out there?

ABOVE, VALKYRIE SCANS THE FIELD FROM HER PEGASUS.

126


127

VALKYRIE 
Yeah.  But you’re not going to like 
where it’s parked.

LUIS’ VAN SITS SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF ALIENS, DEEP BEHIND 
ENEMY LINES.

STEVE SURVEYS THE FIELD: AN ARMY STANDS BETWEEN THEM AND THE 
VAN, AIR AND GROUND CHOKED WITH ENEMIES. 

TONY (INTO COM)
Scott, how long do you need to get 
that thing working?

SCOTT LANG
Uh, maybe ten minutes.

STEVE
Get it started.  We’ll get the 
stones to you.

HOPE VAN DYNE
We’re on it, Cap.

SCOTT glances at her.  Cap?  THEY SHRINK DOWN AND FLY AWAY.

TONY FLIES UP TO DR. STRANGE, HOVERING.

TONY
Doc.  You said we win one in 14 
million.  Is this how it goes down?

DR. STRANGE
If I tell you what happens, it 
won’t happen.

TONY
You better be right. 

Tony rockets away.  Strange coolly watches him go.

ACROSS THE FIELD...EBONY MAW RUSHES TO THANOS.

EBONY MAW
Sire, the stones! 

THANOS TURNS TO SEE...CLINT FIGHTING THROUGH THE HORDE, 
CARRYING THE GAUNTLET.

A CULL HAMMERS CLINT, BUT THEN...T’CHALLA SLASHES THE CULL.

T’CHALLA
Clint, give it to me. 

127


128

CLINT HANDS THE GAUNTLET TO T’CHALLA, WHO TUCKS IT AND RUNS.

ACROSS THE FIELD...SCOTT AND HOPE FLY OVER A LONG PLATOON OF 
CHITAURI, TOWARD LUIS’ VAN.

INT./EXT LUIS’ VAN - CONTINUOUS

They GROW TO NORMAL SIZE in the front seat.  Out the 
windshield, THANOS’ HORDE CHARGES AT THEIR FRIENDS.

SCOTT LANG
(digging around)
Ignition’s broken.  I’ll hotwire it-

HOPE VAN DYNE
Wait, you know how to do that?

Scott splices wires.  Sparks fly.

SCOTT LANG
I was in prison.  I know how to do 
a lot of things.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY

T’CHALLA RACES THROUGH THE HORDE...BUT THEN THANOS KNOCKS HIM 
OFF HIS FEET.  THE GAUNTLET GOES TUMBLING.

AS THANOS MOVES IN ON T’CHALLA...ALL AROUND, WRECKAGE BEGINS 
TO FLOAT.  THANOS LOOKS UP TO SEE...

WANDA, HOVERING IN THE AIR, WAITING FOR HIM.

WANDA
You took everything from me.

Thanos takes THE BLADE off his back.

THANOS
I don’t even know who you are.

WANDA
You will.

WANDA UNLEASHES A STORM OF RED ENERGY, HURLING WRECKAGE AT 
HIM.  AS THANOS FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH IT...

T’CHALLA DIVES FOR THE FALLEN GAUNTLET.  SUDDENLY...EBONY MAW 
MANIPULATES THE EARTH, PULLING THE GAUNTLET TOWARD HIM.  

T’CHALLA WRAPS HIMSELF AROUND THE GLOVE, GETTING DRAGGED.

128


129

PETER PARKER (O.S.)
I GOT IT!  

T’CHALLA TURNS TO SEE PETER WHIZZING PAST.  HE HURLS THE 
GAUNTLET...THWIP!  Peter snatches it out of the air.

HE LANDS, ONLY TO FIND HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY OUTRIDERS.

PETER PARKER (CONT'D)
Activate instant kill!

His robotic arms slash with expert precision.

ACROSS THE FIELD...WANDA LIFTS THANOS INTO THE AIR, RIPS HIS 
ARMOR OFF IN PIECES, THEN SLAMS HIM BACK TO THE GROUND.  

Thanos groans, outmatched.

THANOS (INTO COM)
Rain fire.  Wipe them all out.

CORVUS GLAIVE FIGHTS GROOT. 

CORVUS GLAIVE
But, sire, our troops-

THANOS (INTO COM)
Just do it!

HIGH ABOVE...THE SANCTUARY-2 DESCENDS, CANNONS OPENING UP.

BELOW...WANDA looks up, raising a force field just as...

THE SANCTUARY-2 FIRES DOWN WITH EVERYTHING IT HAS.  SAKAARANS 
AND JABARI ALIKE GO FLYING AS EVERY SQUARE INCH GETS HIT.

THE BARRAGE HAMMERS THE RIVERBANK.  CRACKS FORM.

PEPPER CUTS DOWN AN ALIEN, THEN SPOTS SOMETHING OFF SCREEN.

PEPPER POTTS (INTO COM)
Um, is anyone else seeing this?

TONY, SMART HULK, AND GAMORA turn to see...WATER GUSHING AS 
THE RIVERBANK THREATENS TO COLLAPSE.  SUDDENLY... 

STRANGE AND WONG CONJURE TWO HUGE RUNE SHIELDS TO SHORE UP 
THE BANK.  MORE WIZARDS JOIN, CREATING A HUGE “RUNE LEVEE.”  

THE SANCTUARY-2 MAINTAINS ITS BARRAGE.

ACROSS THE FIELD...STEVE spots PETER PARKER gradually being 
overwhelmed by Outriders.

129


130

PETER PARKER
I got this...I got this...I don’t 
got this.

STEVE
Hey, Queens!  Heads up!

STEVE HURLS MJOLNIR OVER THE THRONG.  PETER WEBS ON...LETTING 
THE HAMMER PULL HIM OUT OF DANGER.  

A MORTAR BLAST KNOCKS HIM OUT OF THE SKY, BUT PEPPER POTTS 
RESCUES HIM.

PEPPER POTTS
Hang on, kid.  I’ve got you.

She drags him above the fray, then tosses him to...VALKYRIE 
FLYING PAST.  PETER PERCHES ATOP PEGASUS.

PETER PARKER
Hey, nice to meet you-aaaaarg!

VALKYRIE SPURS INTO HIGH GEAR, DODGING CANNON FIRE... BUT NOT 
FAST ENOUGH.  A BLAST KNOCKS PETER TO THE GROUND.  

HE GASPS, COVERED IN DEBRIS, STILL CLUTCHING THE GAUNTLET.  

ALL AROUND THE FIELD, THE RELENTLESS BARRAGE PINS DOWN OUR 
HEROES.  ALL HOPE IS LOST.

Rocket and Groot dive for cover.  Groot wraps his branches 
around them both.

ROCKET
At least we’re going out together 
this time...

SUDDENLY, EVERYTHING GOES SILENT.  ROCKET PEERS OUT FROM 
COVER TO SEE...THE CANNONS SWIVELING UP TOWARD THE CLOUDS.

SAM WILSON flies overhead.

SAM WILSON
What the hell is this?

TONY’S HUD: TONY FLIES OVERHEAD, SEARCHING UPWARD.

TONY
Friday, what are they firing at?

FRIDAY (O.S.)
Something just entered the upper 
atmosphere.

130


131

Rocket looks up at...A COMET HEADING STRAIGHT FOR EARTH.

GROOT
(nervous)
I am Groot.

Rocket grins, knowing what’s coming.

ROCKET
Just wait for it.

SUDDENLY, THE COMET VEERS...RIGHT TOWARD THE SHIP.  

BOOM!  THE COMET TEARS THROUGH THE SANCTUARY-2, RIGHT OUT THE 
OTHER SIDE, REVEALING...CAROL DANVERS.

ROCKET (CONT'D)
Oh, yeah! 

CAROL GLOWS BRIGHTER AS SHE GOES BINARY, ROCKETING AGAIN 
THROUGH THE HULL.  BOOM!  THE SHIP LISTS, ENGINES EXPLODING.  

CAROL EYES THE BATTLEFIELD, EXHAUSTED, LIGHT FADING. 

STEVE (OVER COM)
Danvers!  We’re gonna need an 
assist down here!

CAROL DANVERS (INTO COM)
(under ragged breath)
Roger...Rogers...

INT. VAN - DAY

Scott twists wires on the Quantum Tunnel, hotwiring it.

SCOTT LANG (INTO COM)
I’m almost there.  Where’s the 
glove?

EXT. CRATER - DAY

CAROL LANDS IN FRONT OF A DAZED PETER PARKER, WHO STILL HOLDS 
THE GAUNTLET TIGHT.  HE LOOKS UP, CONFUSED.

PETER PARKER
Uh, hey.  I’m Peter Parker.

CAROL DANVERS
Hey, Peter Parker.  You got 
something for me?

131


132

Peter hands it over, staring out at the approaching horde.

PETER PARKER
I don’t know how you’re gonna get 
it through all that-

WANDA (O.S.)
Don’t worry, kid...

Peter turns to see...

WANDA, OKOYE, GAMORA, NEBULA, VALKYRIE, HOPE, AND SHURI 
WAITING.  Wanda’s hands begin to glow.

OKOYE
She’s got help.

Carol glances at PEPPER and MANTIS, then tucks the gauntlet 
under her arm AND LEADS THEM OUT.

AT THE RIDGE...Thanos spots THE WOMEN OF MARVEL BLASTING 
THROUGH HIS TROOPS.  HE TRACKS THEIR PATH TO...THE VAN.

SCOTT KICKS THE REAR DOORS OPEN, EXPOSING THE QUANTUM TUNNEL.

SCOTT LANG
Thirty seconds!

Thanos understands immediately.  HE GRABS PROXIMA’S SPEAR 
FROM HER, AND STARTS RUNNING...

ACROSS THE FIELD...EBONY MAW SENDS WANDA TUMBLING, BUT SHURI 
BLASTS HIM OUT OF THE SKY.

CULL OBSIDIAN HAMMERS VALKYRIE, BUT NEBULA TAKES HIM OUT.

CAROL KEEPS GOING, GAUNTLET TUCKED UNDER HER ARM, GETTING 
CLOSER AND CLOSER TO...

THE VAN...WHERE THE QUANTUM TUNNEL BURSTS TO LIFE.

ACROSS THE FIELD...GROUNDED HEROES LOOK UP TO SEE CAROL NOW 
JUST YARDS AWAY FROM THE GOAL. 

SHE PUTS HER HEAD DOWN, FLYING FOR ALL SHE’S WORTH.  BUT JUST 
AS SHE REACHES THE GAPING VAN DOORS...

THANOS THROWS THE SPEAR...

BOOM!  THE VAN EXPLODES, SENDING SCOTT AND CAROL FLYING, 
TAKING OUT SOME OF THE WIZARDS HOLDING BACK THE RIVER.

THANOS CATCHES PROXIMA’S RETURNING SPEAR.

132


133

TIME SLOWS AS...STEVE, THOR, AND TONY SPOT...THE GAUNTLET, 
LYING UNGUARDED IN THE DIRT.

The problem is...SO DOES THANOS.

TIME RESUMES AS...THEY ALL SCRAMBLE FOR THE STONES.  THEY 
COLLIDE.  THANOS SNATCHES UP THE GAUNTLET, KICKING THOR DOWN.  

THANOS KNOCKS TONY ASIDE, THEN SQUEEZES THE CRUSHED GAUNTLET, 
POPPING IT OPEN...JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO PUT HIS HAND INSIDE.  

STEVE LUNGES, BUT THANOS THROTTLES HIM.  FINALLY CLEAR, 
THANOS SLIPS ON THE GAUNTLET.  BUT BEFORE HE CAN SNAP...

CAROL ARRIVES.  SHE GRABS THE GLOVE, PREVENTING HIM FROM 
CLOSING HIS FIST.  HE HEADBUTTS HER...BUT SHE DOESN’T MOVE.

CAROL PRESSES THANOS DOWN, BUT BEFORE HE FALLS...

THANOS PULLS THE POWER STONE FROM ITS HOUSING AND PUNCHES 
CAROL, SENDING HER FLYING.

THE FIELD GOES QUIET.  NOW, NOTHING STANDS IN THANOS’ WAY.

Tony gets to his knees, realizing...

The Avengers are going to lose.  

ACROSS THE FIELD...WATER STARTS TO SPILL INTO THE CRATER.  

STRANGE TRIES TO HOLD IT BACK...BUT IT’S A LOSING BATTLE.  He 
looks to Tony...

Tony meets his eye.  And in that moment, all Strange can do 
is hold up a single finger.  “One.”

ACROSS THE FIELD...THANOS RETURNS THE POWER STONE TO THE 
GAUNTLET.  JUST AS THE ENERGY SURGES THROUGH HIM...

TONY LUNGES FOR THE GAUNTLET IN THANOS’ HAND, NANO-CLAMPING 
IT IN A VISE.  THANOS KNOCKS HIM ASIDE.

HE LIFTS HIS HAND IN THE AIR, TRIUMPHANT.

THANOS
I am...inevitable. 

THANOS SNAPS HIS FINGERS.  But nothing happens.  Confused, 
Thanos turns the glove over to find...THE STONES ARE GONE. 

He looks to see...TONY, NANO-PARTICLES SLIDING AND SHIFTING, 
FORMING A NEW GAUNTLET ON HIS OWN WRIST:

133


134

COMPLETE WITH SIX INFINITY STONES.  POWER SURGES THROUGH 
TONY, EXCRUCIATING, BUT HE STILL LIFTS HIS HAND...

TONY
And I...am Iron Man.

SNAP!

WHOOSH.  THE TIDAL WAVE EVAPORATES INTO MIST.

ALL AROUND THE FIELD, SAKAARANS AND OUTRIDERS FOLD IN ON 
THEMSELVES, ATOMS DISINTEGRATING.  

THANOS LOOKS AROUND, WATCHING HIS TROOPS DISAPPEAR.  SHIPS 
VANISH FROM THE SKY.  CULLS, CHITAURI, ALL BLOW AWAY...

LEAVING THANOS STANDING ALONE.  AFTER A LONG MOMENT, HE SITS 
DOWN ON A ROCK...AND ACCEPTS HIS FATE.  He watches as...

HIS ATOMS DISSOLVE.  FINALLY, THANOS DISAPPEARS.

ACROSS THE FIELD, QUILL turns to GAMORA...BUT FINDS HER GONE.

QUILL
Babe?  Gamora?

ACROSS THE FIELD...TONY STARK FALLS BACK AGAINST THE UPTURNED 
ROOTS OF A TREE, ARMOR SMOKING, ARM WITHERED AND BLACKENED.  

Dying.

RHODEY RUSHES TO HIM, BUT WITH ONE LOOK, HE KNOWS IT’S TOO 
LATE.  TONY EXHALES, ALMOST LETTING GO.  Then...

PETER PARKER lands, kneeling, taking Tony’s hand.

PETER PARKER
Mr. Stark...Tony...it’s okay, it’s 
okay...Mr. Stark, we won.  You did 
it, sir...

But Tony gazes past him.  Rhodey puts his hand on Peter’s 
shoulder, guiding him away...

AS PEPPER ARRIVES.  She kneels, heartsick.

PEPPER POTTS
Hey, Friday, what’ve we got?

FRIDAY (O.S.)
Life functions critical.

Pepper stares into her husband’s eyes...and knows.

134


(MORE)

135

PEPPER POTTS
Tony, look at me.  We’re going to 
be okay... 

He stares at her, tears welling.  I’m sorry.

She touches his face, then leans in to kiss him.

PEPPER POTTS (CONT'D)
You can rest now.

When she pulls back, she sees his eyes, fixed and glassy.  

Everything goes quiet.  All around, OUR HEROES GATHER, the 
full weight of what’s happened dawning on them.  

Tony Stark is gone.

FADE TO BLACK.

EXT. HIGH SCHOOL NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT

PETER PARKER enters a hallway teeming with students.  He 
searches the crowd, finally finding...NED LEEDS.  

As they embrace...

EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

Fireworks explode over the skyline of San Francisco.

TONY (O.S.)
Everybody wants a happy ending.  
But it doesn’t always roll that 
way.  Maybe this time.  

On Cassie’s porch, SCOTT watches with HOPE and CASSIE, all of 
them grinning.

EXT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY

TWO BIKES lean on the porch of THE BARTON FARM HOUSE.  Then 
the front door opens...and COOPER and LILA BARTON step out.

TONY (O.S.)
I’m hoping if you play this back, 
it’s in celebration.  
(MORE)

135


TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

(MORE)

136

I hope families are reunited, I 
hope we get it back and something 
like a normal version of the planet 
has been restored.  If there ever 
was such a thing.

She looks up at...A QUINJET descending from the sky.

EXT. WAKANDA - SUNSET

ON THE PALACE BALCONY...T’CHALLA embraces his mother, 
RAMONDA.  Shuri turns from them to the magnificent sunset.

TONY (O.S.)
God, what a world.  Universe, now. 
If you’d told me ten years ago that 
we weren’t alone, let alone to this 
extent, I probably wouldn’t have 
been surprised.  But come on...

EXT BARTON HOME - DAY

The Quinjet touches down.  The rear jump door opens, 
revealing CLINT.  He stares at Lila and Cooper, overwhelmed.

TONY (O.S.)
Who knew what epic forces of dark 
and light would come into play?  
For better or worse, that’s the 
reality our children get to grow up 
in.

They throw themselves into his arms.  He kisses their heads, 
tears in his eyes.  Finally, he looks up to see...

LAURA BARTON, beaming, tearful, holding THREE YEAR-OLD 
NATHANIEL’S HAND.  Clint gathers them all into a hug.

INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LIVING ROOM - DAY

A HOLOGRAM of TONY STARK projects from an IRON MAN HELMET on 
the table.

TONY (O.S.)
That’s why I thought I’d probably 
better record a little greeting, in 
the case of…an untimely death on my 
part.  

TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

(MORE)

136


TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

137

I mean, death at any time is 
untimely, but...this “time travel” 
thing we’re going to try to pull 
off tomorrow has me scratching my 
head about the “survivability” of 
it all.  But that’s the hero gig, 
right?  Part of the journey is the 
end. 

REVERSE to find PEPPER, MORGAN, HAPPY HOGAN, RHODEY, THOR, 
STEVE, SMART HULK, and CLINT, all dressed in black, watching.

TONY (CONT'D)
What am I even tripping for? 
Everything is going to work out 
exactly the way it’s supposed to. 

HOLO TONY seems to look out at the gathered heroes...and 
Morgan in particular.

TONY (CONT'D)
I love you 3000. 

He switches off the camera, vanishing.  

Tears streaming, Pepper kisses Morgan’s forehead.

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, BACK STAIRS - DAY

PEPPER and MORGAN slowly descend the stairs, carrying an RT 
RINGED WITH FLOWERS.  The Avengers follow, somber.

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LAKESIDE - DAY

PEPPER RESTS THE FLOWERS ON THE WATER.  

CLOSE ON THE RT: “Proof That Tony Stark Has A Heart.”

Pull back, past Morgan and HAPPY HOGAN...

PAST STEVE, SAM, RHODEY, AND WANDA... 

PAST CLINT, LAURA, LILA, COOPER, and NATHANIEL...

PAST THOR AND SMART HULK...

PAST SCOTT, HOPE, HANK PYM, and JANET VAN DYNE...

PAST PETER PARKER and AUNT MAY...

PAST T’CHALLA, OKOYE, and SHURI, 

TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D)

137


138

PAST STRANGE and WONG...

PAST QUILL, NEBULA, GROOT, MANTIS, and ROCKET...

PAST BUCKY BARNES... 

PAST SECRETARY ROSS and HARLEY KEENER...

PAST MARIA HILL, CAROL DANVERS, and, finally, NICK FURY.

THE MOURNERS MOVE TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE.

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LAKESIDE - DAY

LATER...CLINT looks out at the lake.  WANDA approaches.

CLINT BARTON
I just wish there were some way I 
could let her know that we won.  
That we did it.  

WANDA
She knows.  They both do.

Clint puts his arm around her.  They stare out at the water.

EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, PORCH/BACK STAIRS- DAY

ON THE PORCH, HAPPY HOGAN HOLDS MORGAN’S HAND.

HAPPY HOGAN 
How are you doing, squirt?  You 
hungry?

MORGAN STARK
Uh, huh.

HAPPY HOGAN
What do you want?

MORGAN STARK
Cheeseburgers?

Happy takes a beat, choked up.  Like father like daughter.  

HAPPY HOGAN
Did you know your dad liked 
cheeseburgers?

MORGAN STARK
No, I didn’t know that.

138


139

HAPPY HOGAN
I’m going to get you all the 
cheeseburgers you want.

EXT. NEW ASGARD, HILLSIDE - DAY

THOR and VALKYRIE look down on NEW ASGARD.

VALKYRIE
So when can we expect you back?

THOR
About that...

VALKYRIE
Thor, your people need a king.

THOR
They already have one.  And she’s a 
far better king than I could ever 
be.

VALKYRIE
Are you serious?

THOR
It’s time to be who I am, rather 
than who I’m supposed to be.  And a 
leader is who you are.

She processes this.  Does she want it?  She does.

VALKYRIE
You know, I’d make a lot of changes 
around here.

THOR
I’m counting on it, Your Majesty.

Emotional, Val finally SHAKES HIS HAND.  

VALKYRIE
What will you do?

THOR
I’m not entirely sure.  For the 
first time in a thousand years, I 
have no path.  
(beat)
But I do have a ride.

REVEAL...THE BENATAR parked behind them, Rocket alongside.

139


140

ROCKET
Move it or lose it, Hairbag.

INT. BENATAR - DAY

THOR drops his duffle bag on the deck of the Benatar.  QUILL, 
MANTIS, DRAX, NEBULA, and ROCKET ready the engines.  

THOR
Home sweet home.  Tree!  Good to 
see you.  The Asgardians of the 
Galaxy, together again.

He settles beside Quill, who holomaps their course. 

THOR (CONT'D)
All right, where first?

He swipes through images on the screen.

QUILL
You know, I’m still in charge, 
here, right?

THOR
Of course.  Of course...

Thor swipes the map again.

QUILL
See, when you keep swiping my map, 
that sounds kind of like, “of 
course, I know you think you’re 
still in charge-”

THOR
Quail, that’s your own insecurities 
bubbling up.

DRAX
You should fight one another for 
the honor of leadership.

NEBULA
Sounds fair. 

QUILL
That’s not necessary...

ROCKET
I’ve got some blasters right here. 
Unless you want to use knives.

140


141

MANTIS
Oh, yes, please, use knives-

QUILL
No one’s using knives!

GROOT
I am Groot!

Quill and Thor exchange nervous laughter.

THOR
There’ll be no knifing young Quail 
today.  Everyone knows who’s in 
charge.

A long awkward moment passes.

QUILL
Me.
(sotto, to Thor)
Right?

Thor just smiles...

EXT. NEW ASGARD, HILLSIDE - DAY

The ship rises.  WHOOSH.  IT MAKES THE JUMP AND DISAPPEARS.

EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY

CONSTRUCTION CREWS REMOVE RUBBLE FROM AVENGERS COMPOUND.  A 
COMMAND TENT stands in a clearing beside...

A NEW QUANTUM TUNNEL (3.0).  

As STEVE, SAM, and BUCKY wait, SMART HULK makes last minute 
adjustments.  He finally opens A CASE:

THE SIX INFINITY STONES GLOW INSIDE.

SMART HULK
Remember, you’ll have to return the 
stones to the exact moment they 
were taken.  Otherwise, we’re still 
looking at a whole bunch of nasty 
alternate realities.

STEVE
Got it.  I’ll clip all the 
branches.  

141


142

Steve takes the case.

SMART HULK
You know, I tried.  When I had the 
gauntlet.  I really tried to bring 
her back. 
(beat)
I miss her.

STEVE
Me, too. 

SMART HULK
You’d better get going.  We’re 
almost ready for you.

Steve and Sam approach the platform.  

SAM WILSON
You look a little nervous going by 
yourself.  Ask nicely, I’ll go with 
you. 

STEVE
You’re a good man, Sam.  But this 
one’s on me.

When Steve reaches the platform, BUCKY stops him, pointed.

STEVE (CONT'D)
Don’t do anything stupid ‘til I get 
back, okay?

BUCKY BARNES
How can I?  You’re taking all the 
stupid with you.

Steve grins.  Bucky gives him a long hug.

BUCKY BARNES (CONT'D)
Gonna miss you, buddy.

STEVE
It’s going to be okay, Buck.

Steve picks up Mjolnir and takes his place on the platform.

SAM LOOKS TO SMART HULK AT THE CONSOLE.

SAM WILSON 
How long’s this gonna take?

142


143

SMART HULK
For him, as long as he needs.  For 
us, five seconds.  
(calling out)
Ready, Cap?  You’re good to go.  
Meet you right back here, okay?

Steve glances at Bucky as he answers.

STEVE
You bet.

SMART HULK
Going Quantum in three, two, one.

STEVE TAPS HIS CUFF AND SHRINKS TO NOTHING.  

SMART HULK (CONT'D)
Aaand, returning in five... 
four...three...two...one-

Silence.  Nothing happens.

SAM WILSON 
Where is he?

SMART HULK
I don’t know.  He blew past our 
time stamp.  He should be here.  

SAM WILSON
Get him back!  

SMART HULK
I’m trying. 

SAM WILSON
Get him the hell back-

SMART HULK
I’M TRYING!

Just then...Bucky looks out to the water.

BUCKY BARNES
Sam.

Sam turns...

EXT AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS

Work crews have cleared a space overlooking the river.  
There, AN OLD MAN sits on a bench, staring out at the Hudson.

143


144

Move around him to find SAM watching from A FEW YARDS AWAY.

SAM WILSON
Hey, Cap.

The man turns and we now see: STEVE ROGERS, age 112.

OLD STEVE
Hi, Sam.

SAM WILSON
Something go wrong...or something 
go right?

OLD STEVE
I thought, after everything that’s 
happened...maybe I should try out 
some of that life Tony always told 
me to get. 

SAM WILSON
How was it?

Steve looks at the river, 112 years of emotion in his face.

OLD STEVE
It was beautiful.  

SAM WILSON
I’m happy for you.  Really.

OLD STEVE
Thanks.

SAM WILSON
Only thing bumming me out is now I 
live in a world without Captain 
America.

Steve pulls up A CASE from beside him, giving it to Sam.

OLD STEVE
That’s kind of why I’m here.

Sam unzips it, revealing...A BRAND NEW SHIELD.

SAM WILSON
Where did you even get this?

OLD STEVE
I had a little time to travel. 
(beat)
Try it on.

144


145

Sam hesitates.  He glances back at Bucky, who nods.  Then Sam 
picks up the shield...and puts it on.

OLD STEVE (CONT'D)
How does it feel?

SAM WILSON
Like it’s someone else’s.

OLD STEVE
It isn’t.

Sam tries to check his emotion.  He shakes Steve’s hand.

SAM WILSON
Thank you.  I’ll try my best.

Steve rests his other hand on Sam’s.

OLD STEVE
That’s why it’s yours.

Sam smiles, noticing...STEVE’S TARNISHED WEDDING RING.

SAM WILSON
You gonna tell me about her?

Steve smiles to himself at the end of a long, long life.

OLD STEVE
Nope.  I don’t think I will.

Space, a floating staircase among the rocks...THE OTHER
speaks to a DISEMBODIED FIGURE in a chair.

THE OTHER (V.O)
The Tesseract has awakened. It is
on a little world, a human world.
They would wield its power.

THE OTHER hands LOKI a scepter with a glowing blue gem...

THE OTHER (V.O)
But our ally knows its workings as
they never will. He is ready to
lead. And our force...

The CHITAURI put on their face mask and get ready.

THE OTHER (V.O)
...our Chitauri, will follow. The
world will be his...the universe,
yours. And the humans, what can
they do but burn?

A 3d model of the Tesseract, we move inside it slowly

This base is grand beyond belief. There is a frantic
evacuation in progress. AGENTS, SCIENTISTS, and PERSONNEL
rush around the base frantically.

INTERCOM VOICE
All personnel, evacuation order has
been confirmed. Proceed to your
designated vehicles...

A man flushes people by. The sign on the building reads:

JOINT DARK ENERGY MISSION; WESTERN DIVISION; PROJECT
PEGASUS, NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY, S.H.I.E.L.D
ACCELERATOR TEST FACILITY

There is a man in suit waiting. This is AGENT PHIL COULSON.

ON THE CHOPPER: The door slides open. Out comes a female,
this is AGENT MARIA HILL. Following behind her is NICK FURY.

Fury and Hill walk over to Coulson.

FURY
How bad is it?

AGENT COULSON
That’s the problem, sir. We don’t
know.

An elevator rushes down. It’s going fast.

AGENT COULSON (V.O)

Coulson, Fury, and Hill make their way through the crowds of
evacuating personnel.

AGENT COULSON
...energy surge from the Tesseract
four hours ago.

FURY
NASA didn’t authorize Selvig could
go to test B.

AGENT COULSON
He wasn’t testing it. He wasn’t
even in the room. Spontaneous
event.

MARIA HILL
It just turned itself on?

FURY
Where are the energy levels now?

AGENT COULSON
Climbing. When Selvig couldn’t shut
it down we ordered evac.

FURY
How long to get everyone out?

AGENT COULSON
Campus should be clear in the next
half hour.

FURY
Do better.

Fury and Hill continue on as Coulson turns around and heads
the other way.

INT. STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER (EARLY NIGHT)

Fury and Hill make their way down to the lower levels.

MARIA HILL
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

FURY
We should tell them to go back to
sleep?

MARIA HILL
If we can’t control the Tesseract’s
energy there may not be a minimum
safe distance.

FURY
I need you to make sure the Phase
Two prototypes are shipped out.

MARIA HILL
Sir, is that really a priority
right now?

FURY
Until such time as the world ends
we will act as though it intends to
spin on. Clear out the tech below.
Every piece of Phase Two on a truck
and gone.

Fury makes his way over to ERIK SELVIG.

FURY
Talk to me, Doctor.

SELVIG
Director.

FURY
Is there anything we know for
certain?

SELVIG
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

FURY
Is that supposed to be funny?

SELVIG
No, it’s not funny at all. The
Tesseract is not only active, she’s
misbehaving.

FURY
How soon can you pull the plug?

SELVIG
She’s an energy source. We turn off
the power, she turns it back on. If
she reaches peak level-

FURY
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

SELVIG
We don’t have the harness. My
calculations are far from complete.
She’s throwing off interference,
radiation. Nothing harmful, low
levels of Gamma radiation.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (2)

FURY
That can be harmful. Where’s agent
Barton?

SELVIG
The hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.

CLINT BARTON, also known as HAWKEYE, is on a balcony,
observing the lab.

FURY
(over Barton’s radio)
Agent Barton. Report.

Barton zip-lines down a rope.

FURY (V.O)
(sturn)
I gave you this detail so you could
keep a close eye on things.

Fury and Barton walk together toward the Tesseract machine.

BARTON
I see better from a distance.

FURY
Have you seen anything that might
set this thing off?

A NASA SCIENTIST calls for Selvig.

NASA SCIENTIST
Doctor! It’s spiking again.

Barton and Fury step onto the platform, in front of the
Tesseract machine.

BARTON
No one’s come and gone. And
Selvig’s clean. No contacts, no IM.
If there’s any tampering, sir, it
wasn’t this end.

While Barton is talking Selvig walks over to the computer
where the NASA SCIENTIST is. He looks concerned and worried.

FURY
(a little confused)
At this end?

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (3)

BARTON
Yeah. The Cube is a doorway to the
other end of space, right?
Doors
open from both sides.

The Cube sparks.

SELVIG
What’s that?

It sparks again.

Coulson stands. The grounds of the campus shakes. He grabs
the truck.

Hill turns and looks around her, hearing a creaking noise as
the building shakes.

11
INT. TESSERACT CHAMBER ROOM - CONTINUOUS
11

The Cube sparks some more, bigger each time. A beam of
energy which opens into a portal. There is an explosion.

A could from the beam floats to the top of the chamber. On
the platform is LOKI, God of Mischief and Lies, kneeling.
Several GUARDS move in slowly.

TIGHT ON LOKI: He looks up, grinning menacingly. She stands.

DOLLY IN: Fury and Barton stare in shock.

ON SELVIG: He is in awe and horror.

Loki looks around. Fury is ready to act.

FURY
(to Loki)
Sir, please put down the spear!

Loki looks at his scepter then fires a stream on blue light
from it. Barton pushes Fury out the way. The guards open
fire. Loki jumps at them, firing more energy and fighting.
Shooting scientists and agents. Barton moves towards him but
Loki grabs his arm.

LOKI
You have heart.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (2)

Loki touches the tip of the spear to Barton’s chest and his
eyes become ice blue. He puts his gun away. Loki moves to
another agent and does the same as he’s done to Barton.

Fury pulls the Cube from the machine it was in and shuts it
in a briefcase, then moves to leave.

LOKI
(to Fury, turning around)
Please don’t. I still need that.

FURY
This doesn’t have to get any
messier.

LOKI
Of course it does. I’ve come too
far for anything else. I am Loki,
of Asgard. And I am burdened with
glorious purpose.

Selvig, checking the pulse of NASA SCIENTIST, hears and
approaches.

SELVIG
Loki, brother of Thor?

FURY
We have no quarrel with your
people.

LOKI
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

FURY
You planning to step on us?

LOKI
I come with glad tidings, of a
world made free.

FURY
Free from what?

LOKI
Freedom. Freedom is life’s great
lie. Once you accept that, in your
heart-

Loki turns and places the spear tip on Selvig’s chest.
-you will know peace.

Barton sees the Tesseract portal cloud, brewing and moves to
Loki.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (3)

FURY
Yeah, you say peace. I kinda think
you mean the other thing.

BARTON
(to Loki)
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.
This place is about to blow and
drop a hundred feet of rock on us.
He means to bury us.

FURY
Like the pharaohs of old.

SELVIG
He’s right. The portal is
collapsing in on itself. We’ve got
maybe two minutes before this goes
critical.

LOKI
Well then.

Barton quickly draws his gun and shoots Fury, who drops the
case. Barton picks up as he, Loki, Selvig and another agent
leave the room.

12
INT. SECURITY LEVEL FOUR - A FEW SHORT MOMENTS LATER

Barton and the others walk under the closing gate. Hill
comes out from the back room.

BARTON
We need this vehicles.

MARIA HILL
(seeing Loki)
Who’s that?

BARTON
Didn’t tell me.

The roof is slowly crumbling. Loki gets onto a SHIELD pickup
truck. Selvig enters the passenger seat, holding the case.

Coulson is assisting evacuation, supervising guards as the
wheel crates. An explosion rocks the building. They all fall
as the roof dissolves faster. The four guards try to pick up
the case-

Let’s just go. No-no-no! Leave it,
leave it. GO!

A train speeds by. CAMERA PULLS through the warehouse window
and MOVES UP to the third floor where NATASHA ROMANOFF aka
BLACK WIDOW, is tied to a chair. A man slaps her. She
screams.

GEORGI LUCHKOV

This isn’t how I wanted this
evening to go.

NATASHA

I know how you wanted this evening.
Believe me this is better.

TALL THUG walks over to Natasha and leans the chair over a
pit. She becomes scared.

GEORGI LUCHKOV (CONT’D)

Does he think we have to go through
him to move our cargo?

NATASHA
(in Russian)
I thought General Solohob is in
charge of the export business.

GEORGI LUCHKOV
(in Russian)
Solohob. A bagman, a front. Your
outdated information betrays you.
The famous Black Widow is just
another pretty face.

NATASHA
(in Russian)
You really think I’m pretty?

TALL THUG grabs her jaw and forces it open as Luchkov walks
to the table behind him.

GEORGI LUCHKOV
(in Russian)
Tell Lermentov we don’t need him to
move the tanks. Tell him he is out.
Well...

Luchkov picks up a tool of the table and plays with it.
...You may have to write it.

Suddenly a phone rings. WEASELLY THUG answers his phone.

WEASELLY THUG
It’s for her.

Luchkov takes the phone.

GEORGI LUCHKOV
(in Russian; into cell)
You listen carefully-

AGENT COULSON (V.O)
(over the cell)
You’re at 1- 14 Silensky Plaza, 3rd
floor. We have an F-22 exactly
eight miles out. Put the woman on
the phone or I will blow up the
block before you can make the
lobby.

Luchkov hands the phone to Natasha, who balances it on her
shoulder.

We need you to come in.

NATASHA

Are you kidding? I’m working.

AGENT COULSON
(over the cell)
This takes precedence.

NATASHA

I’m in the middle of an
interrogation, and this moron is
giving me everything.

GEORGI LUCHKOV

I not- give everything.

Natasha gives Luchkov a look.

BEGIN INTERCUT: COULSON / NATASHA

NATASHA

Look, you can’t pull me out of this
right now.

AGENT COULSON
(into cell)
Natasha...Barton’s been
compromised.

NATASHA
(into cell)
Let me put you on hold.

Luchkov moves in for the cell phone. Natasha kicks him
between the legs and headbutts him. WEASELLY THUG swings his
fist at her and she kicks him back. TALL THUG runs up and
she spins around -- and the chair legs hit him.

WEASELLY THUG jumps to his feet. Natasha rolls with the
chair and drops the legs on his feet. She whips her head at
him and hits him in the nose then trips him.

As she fights the TALL THUG, Coulson listens to the fight
over the phone. He stands quiet -- waiting as he hears the
groaning, kicking, and punching.

Natasha spring boards off TALL THUG’s back, somersaults, and
breaks the chair on WEASELLY THUG. TALL THUG grabs her and
Natasha bends his hand then hits him with the chair leg. She
does a front dropkick against TALL THUG then pushes herself
off the ground with both hands.

She runs toward TALL THUG, who is out of breath, and flips
him with her thighs. Luchkov stands and she swiftly walks
over to the chain hanging from the ceiling. As he approaches
she hits him with it, wraps one leg in it, and throws him
into the pit. She leaves him upside down and picks up the
cell and her high heels.

NATASHA (CONT’D)
(into cell)
Where’s Barton now?

AGENT COULSON
(over cell)
We don’t know.

NATASHA
But he’s alive?

AGENT COULSON
(into phone)
We think so.

Coulson is looking at a screen that’s playing a video of
Hawkeye & Black Widow in Budapest.
We’ll brief you on everything when
you get back.

Coulson is handed a folder. He walks down some stairs as he
talks.
But first, we need you to talk to
the big guy.

NATASHA
(into cell)
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts
me about as far as he can throw me.

AGENT COULSON
Oh I’ve got Stark! You get the big

into a house and up the stairs.

CALCUTTA WOMAN approaches her. BRUCE BANNER, the alter ego
of the Incredible Hulk, is treating the ill in the b.g.

CALCUTTA WOMAN

Who are you? Get out! There is
sickness here!

YOUNG GIRL

Are you the doctor? I need a
doctor. My father. My father’s not

moaning but his eyes won’t open.

Banner hears and moves over to the YOUNG GIRL. He kneels
before her.

BANNER

Slow down.

YOUNG GIRL

Natasha reveals herself to Banner from behind a curtain.

Avoiding stress isn’t the secret.

NATASHA
Then what is it? Yoga?

BANNER
And you brought me to the end of

NATASHA
No, no. Of course not. I’m here on
behalf of SHIELD.

BANNER

SHIELD. How’d they find me?

NATASHA
We never lost you, Doctor. We’ve
kept our distance, even helped keep
some other interested parties off
your scent.

BANNER
Why?

NATASHA
Nick Fury seems to trust you. But
now we need you to come in.

BANNER
What if I say no?

NATASHA
(seductive, sturn, smiling)
I’ll persuade you.

BANNER
(a little sad and reluctant)
And what if the- Other Guy says no?

BANNER
(chuckles)
Oh those I actively try to avoid.

NATASHA
This (takes a seat) is the
Tesseract.

Natasha slides a cell phone along the table. On it is an
image of the Tesseract.
It has the potential energy to wipe
out the planet.

Banner puts on his glasses, approaches and picks up the
touch screen cell phone.

BANNER
What does Fury want me to do?
Swallow it?

NATASHA
He wants you to find it. It’s been
taken. It emits a Gamma signature
that’s too weak for us to trace. No
one knows Gamma radiation like you
do. If there was, that’s where I’d
be.

BANNER
So Fury isn’t after the monster?

NATASHA
Not that he’s told me.

BANNER
And he tells you everything?

NATASHA
Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.

BANNER
(immediate response)
He needs me in a cage?

(CONTINUED)

NATASHA
No one’s going to put you in a-

BANNER
STOP LYING TO ME!

Banner yells, crashing his hands down on the table. Natasha
stands, pulling a gun and aims at him. He draws back,
smiling.
I’m sorry. That was mean. (smiles)
I just wanted to see what you’d do.

Natasha stares at him, a little teary, scared out of her
mind.
Why don’t we do this the easy way
where you don’t use that and the-
Other Guy doesn’t make a mess?
Okay?....Natasha.

Natasha lowers her weapon and speaks into an earpiece.

NATASHA
(quietly into her earpiece)
Stand down. We’re good here.

The horde of armed guards surrounding the shack lower their
weapons.

BANNER
Just you and me?

Natasha realizes he knows and stands silent.

Fury is talking with the Council, four shadowy figures on
screens.

COUNCILMAN
This is out of line, Director.
You’re dealing with forces you
can’t control.

FURY
You ever been in a war, councilman?
In a fire fight? Did you feel an
over abundance of control?

COUNCILMAN
You’re saying that this Asgard is
declaring war on our planet?

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (2)
21.

FURY
Not Asgard, Loki.

COUNCILWOMAN
He can’t be working alone. What
about the other one, his brother?

FURY
Our intelligence says Thor is not a
hostile. But he’s worlds away and
we can’t depend on him to help
either. It’s up to us.

COUNCILMAN
Which is why you should be focusing
on Phase Two, it was designed for
exactly this purpose.

FURY
Phase Two isn’t ready; our enemy
is. We need a response team.

COUNCILMAN
The Avengers Initiative was shut
down.

FURY
This isn’t about the Avengers.

COUNCILMAN
We’re running the world’s greatest
covert security network and you’re
gonna leave the fate of the human
race to a handful of freaks.

FURY
I’m not leaving anything to anyone.
We need a response team. These
people may be isolated, unbalanced
even, but I believe, with the right
push, they can be exactly what we
need.

COUNCILWOMAN
You believe!

COUNCILMAN
War isn’t won by sentiment,
Director.

FURY
No, It’s won by soldiers.

STEVE ROGERS, alter ego of Captain America, is hitting a
punching bag in a gym. He has several flashbacks of World
War Two. During his flashbacks...

CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O)
There’s not enough time. I gotta
put her in the water.

...he hits the bag harder, faster...

PEGGY CARTER (V.O)
You won’t be alone.

...he hits the bag even faster.

SCIENTIST (V.O)
Oh my God. This guy’s still alive.

Steve throws the hardest punch he has left and it knocks the
bag across the room. Breathing hard, Steve picks up another
bag from a line on the floor and hangs it up. He begins to
hit it. And-

FURY
(across the room)
Trouble sleeping?

STEVE
(hitting the bag)
Slept for seventy years, Sir. I
think I’ve had my fill.

Fury slowly approaches Steve.

FURY
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

STEVE
When I went under, the world was at
war. I wake up- they say we won.
They didn’t say what we lost.

FURY
We’ve made some mistakes along the
way, some very recently.

STEVE
(removing hand wrap)
You here with a mission, Sir?

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (2)

FURY
I am.

STEVE
(removing other hand wrap)
Trying to get me back in the world?

FURY
Trying to save it.

Fury hands Steve a folder with information on the Tesseract
in it.

STEVE
HYDRA’s secret weapon.

FURY
Howard Stark fished that out of the
ocean when he was looking for you.
He thought what we think. The
Tesseract could be the key to
unlimited sustainable energy.
That’s something the world sorely
needs.

STEVE
Who took it from you?

FURY
He’s called Loki. He’s- not from
around here. There’s a lot we’ll
have to bring you up to speed on if
you’re in. The world has gotten
even stranger than you already
know.

STEVE
At this point I doubt anything
would surprise me.

Steve gets up, grabs his duffel bag, and another punching
bag while Fury is talking.

FURY
Ten bucks says you’re wrong.
There’s a debriefing packet waiting
for you back at your apartment. Is
there anything you can tell us
about the Tesseract that we ought
to know now?

IRON MAN
Good to go on this end. The rest is

PEPPER (V.O)

We’ve got to go wider on the public

Iron Man flies over a overpass & up the side of Stark Tower.

PEPPER (V.O)
(over Iron Man headset)
I’m in DC tomorrow. I’m working on

Pepper stands in front of a holographic display, a little
confused.

PEPPER
Levels are holding steady- I think.

Tony approaches Pepper.

TONY
Of course they are, I was directly
involved. Which leads me to my next
question. How does it feel to be a
genius?

Tony turns off the display and Pepper and he face each
other.

PEPPER
Well, ah, I really wouldn’t know
now would I?

TONY
What do you mean? All this came
from you.

PEPPER
No, all this came from that.

Pepper taps Tony’s arc reactor.

TONY
Give yourself some credit, please.
Stark Tower is your baby. Give
yourself- twelve percent of the
credit.

PEPPER
Twelve percent?
TONY
An argument can be made for
fifteen.

Pepper walks toward the living room.

PEPPER
Twelve percent of my baby?

TONY

Well, I did do all the heavy
lifting. Literally, I lifted the
heavy things and sorry but, the
security snafu? That was on you.

PEPPER
Oh!

TONY
My private elevator.

Pepper pours champagne in two glasses.

PEPPER
You mean our elevator.

TONY
Yeah, it was teeming with sweaty
workmen. I’m going to pay for that
comment about percentages in some
subtle way later aren’t I?

PEPPER
Not gonna be that subtle.

TONY
I’ll tell you what, next building
is gonna say ’Potts’ on the tower.

PEPPER
On the lease!

TONY
Call your mum, can you bunk over?

JARVIS
Sir, the telephone. I’m afraid my
protocols are being overridden.

TONY
Ah-

Tony picks up his high-tech phone and holds up.

AGENT COULSON
(on phone screen)
Mr. Stark, we need to talk.

TONY
You have reached the Life Model
Decoy of Tony Stark. Please leave a

AGENT COULSON

Pepper and Tony walk over to Coulson, who is entering

TONY
Phil?

AGENT COULSON
I can’t stay.

TONY
Uh, his first name is Agent.

PEPPER
Come on in, we’re celebrating.

TONY
(fake smiling)
Which is why he can’t stay.

AGENT COULSON
(handing Tony the laptop)
We need you to look this over, as
soon as possible.

Tony stares at the laptop.

TONY
I don’t like being handed things.

PEPPER
That’s fine because I love to be
handed things. So, let’s trade.

Pepper swaps with Coulson -- he has with her glass and she
has the laptop. She then takes Tony’s glass and passes the
laptop on to him.
Thank you.

TONY
Official consulting hours are

Thursday.

AGENT COULSON
This isn’t a consultation.

PEPPER
Is this about the Avengers?

Coulson looks at Pepper
Which I know nothing about.

TONY
The Avengers Initiative was
scrapped, I thought, and I didn’t
even qualify.

PEPPER
I didn’t know that either.

TONY
Yeah, apparently I’m volatile,
self-obsessed, don’t play well with
others.

PEPPER
That I did know.

AGENT COULSON
This isn’t about personality
profiles anymore.

TONY
Whatever! Ms. Potts, got a sec?

PEPPER
Half a moment.

Pepper leaves Coulson at the door and goes over to Tony.

TONY
You know, I thought we were having
a moment.

PEPPER
I was having twelve percent of a
moment.

Tony gives Pepper a look.
This seems serious. Phil looks
pretty shaken.

TONY

Holograms fill the room, each is a article on one of the
Avengers.
...this!

They both look upon the screens, observing them.

PEPPER
I’m going to take the jet to DC
tonight.

TONY
Tomorrow.

PEPPER
You have homework. You have a lot
of homework.

TONY
Well, what if I didn’t?

PEPPER
If you didn’t? You mean when you
finished? Well, um, then-

She leans in and whispers in Tony’s ear.

TONY
Square deal. Fly safe.

They kiss. Coulson looks away.

PEPPER
Work hard.
(approaching Coulson)
So, any chance you’re driving by
LaGuardia?

AGENT COULSON
I can drop you off.

PEPPER (O.S)
Fantastic. Ooh, I want to hear

Coulson stands from a chair and walks over to Steve.

STEVE
So, this Doctor Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on
me?

AGENT COULSON
A lot of people were. You were the
world’s first superhero. Banner
thought Gamma radiation might hold
the key to unlocking Erskine’s
original formula.

STEVE
Didn’t really go his way, did it?

AGENT COULSON
Not so much. When he’s not that
thing though, guy’s like a Stephen
Hawking.

Rogers looks confused.
He’s like a- smart person. I gotta
say- it’s an honor to meet you,
officially. I sort of met you, I
mean, I watched you while you were
sleeping. I mean, I was, I was
present, while you were unconscious

AGENT COULSON
Oh you are, absolutely. Ah- we made
some modifications to the uniform.
I had a little design input.

STEVE
The uniform? Aren’t the stars and

You don’t have the Tesseract yet.

The Chitauri creature lunges at Loki, hissing.
I don’t threaten. But until I open
the doors, until your force is mine
to command, you are but words.

THE OTHER
You will have your war, Asgardian.
If you fail, if the Tesseract is

STEVE
Trading cards?

NATASHA
They’re vintage. He’s very proud.

They see Banner who is bumping into people while he observes
the carrier.

STEVE

Oh, yeah, hi. They told me you’d be

Once we get our hands on the

Well where are you with that?

Cell phones...

Steve stands in the b.g. confused of what’s being said.
While Coulson is talking, Natasha moves over to a computer
screen where we see Barton’s face trace in progress. She
checks the stats.

SELVIG
Yeah. Iridium. It’s found in

BARTON
You’re going to have to contend
with him sir. As long as he’s in

he’ll be putting together a team.

LOKI
Are they a threat?

BARTON
To each other more than likely. But
if Fury can get ’em on track, and
he might, they could throw some
noise our way.

LOKI
You admire Fury.

BARTON
He’s got a clear line of sight.

LOKI
Is that why you failed to kill him?

BARTON
It might be. I was disoriented, and
I’m not at my best with a gun.

LOKI
I want to know everything you can
tell me about this team of his. I

Is not this simpler? Is this not

Loki fires his scepter but Captain America jumps in front of
the man -- deflecting the beam off his shield causing it to
hit Loki, who falls to the ground.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
You know, the last time I was in
Germany and saw a man standing
above everybody else, we ended up
disagreeing.

LOKI
The soldier-

Loki rises to his feet.
-the man out of time.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
I’m not the one who’s out of time.

The quinjet comes in behind Cap with Black Widow inside. A
gun unfolds from the underside of the plane.

NATASHA
(over speaker)
Loki, drop the weapon and stand
down.

Loki fires at the jet and it banks hard to avoid it. Cap
attacks Loki and the two fight. Loki knocks Cap’s shield to
the side and forces him down with his scepter.

LOKI
Kneel!

CAPTAIN AMERICA
Not today.

Cap jumps up and does a spin-kick to Loki’s face. The two
continue to fight.

Natasha, in her Black Widow suit, is trying to figure out

NATASHA

Guy’s all over the place.

TONY
(over earpiece)
Agent Romanoff, you miss me?

The computer screen shows the message ’PA SYSTEMS OVERRIDE’,
and AC/DC’s, ’Shoot to Thrill’ begins to play. Natasha
smiles heavily. Iron Man flies down and fires a repulsor
blast, knocking Loki down.

IRON MAN
Make a move reindeer games.

Loki’s Asgardian garb fades away and he raises his hands.
Good move.

Cap walks over to Iron Man. The quinjet begins to land in

Natasha is piloting the plane. Loki is strapped down in the
back of the plane. Cap, in suit but no cowl, and Tony, in
the suit but without the helmet, is standing behind the
cockpit and they talking.

FURY

He saying anything?

NATASHA

Not a word.

STEVE
What?

TONY
It’s like calisthenics. You might

Y’know, doing time as a Cap-sicle.

STEVE
Fury didn’t tell me he was calling
you in.

TONY
Yeah, there’s a lot of things Fury
doesn’t tell you.

There’s a flash of lightening and a roar of thunder.

NATASHA
Where’s this come from?

Loki leans forward, looking around.

STEVE
(to Loki)
What’s the matter? Scared of a
little lightening?

LOKI
I’m not overly fond of what

Loki looks to the sky.

jet.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
What are you doing?

Thor enters, jumping down on the ramp. He hits Iron Man
away, causing him to fall on Cap. He grabs Loki by the neck
and jumps out of the plane.

IRON MAN
Now there’s that guy.

NATASHA
Another Asgardian?

CAPTAIN AMERICA
That guy’s a friendly.

NATASHA
Doesn’t matter. If he frees Loki,
or kills him, the Tesseract’s lost.

Iron Man begins walking to the edge of the ramp.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
Stark, we need a plan of attack.

IRON MAN
I have a plan. Attack!

Iron Man flies out of the jet and Cap makes for a parachute.

NATASHA
I’d sit this one out, Cap.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
I don’t see how I can.

NATASHA
These guys come from legend,
they’re basically Gods.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
There’s only one God ma’am, and I’m
pretty sure he doesn’t dress like
that.

Cap straps on the chute, grabs his shield, and dives out the
plane, head first.

EXT. CLIFF TOP - NIGHT

Thor and Loki crash down on a cliff. Thor throws Loki to the
ground, he groans.

THOR
Where is the Tesseract?

LOKI
Oh-ho, I missed you too.

THOR
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

LOKI
Oh, you should thank me. With the
Bifrost gone, how many dark energy
did the All-Father
have to muster
to conjure you here? Your precious
Earth.

Thor drops his hammer, Mjolnir, and pulls Loki to his feet.

THOR
I thought you dead.

LOKI
Did you mourn?

THOR
We all did. Our father-

LOKI
Your father. He did tell you my
true parentage, did he not?

THOR
We were raised together, we played
together, we fought together. Do
you remember none of that?

LOKI
I remember a shadow, living in the
shade of your greatness. I remember
you tossing me
into an abyss. I
who was and should be king!

THOR
So you take the world I love as
recompense for your imagined
slights? No. The Earth is under my
protection, Loki.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (2)
48.

LOKI
Well yes.

THOR
Then you miss the truth of ruling,
brother. Throne would suit you ill.

Loki pushes past Thor and walks away, Thor follows.

LOKI
I’ve seen worlds you’ve never known
about. I have grown, Odinson, in my
exile. I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract, and when I wield
it-

THOR
Who showed you this power? Who
controls the would-be-king?

LOKI
I am a king!

THOR
Not here. You give up the
Tesseract; you give up this
poisonous dream! You come home.

LOKI
I don’t have it.

Thor summons Mjolnir and holds it ready.
You need the Cube to bring me home
but I’ve sent it off I know not
where.

THOR
You listen well brother-

Iron Man flies in, knocking him and Thor out of frame. Loki
stands waiting.

LOKI
I’m listening?

Thor and Iron Man crash through the trees to the ground,
Tony lifts his faceplate.

THOR
Do not touch me again.

TONY
Then don’t take my stuff.

THOR
You have no idea what you’re
dealing with.

TONY
Uh- Shakespeare in the park? Doth
mother know you wear-th her drapes?

THOR
This is beyond you, metal man. Loki
will face Asgardian justice.

TONY
He gives up the Cube, he’s all
yours. Until then-

Faceplate drops.

IRON MAN
-stay out of the way.

Iron Man takes a few steps.
Tourist.

Thor throws
Mjolnir, hitting Iron Man square in the chest,
sending him flying, landing on his back.

INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET:

TONY
Okay!

BACK TO SCENE:

Loki smirks from the cliff top as Thor summons Mjolnir then
swings it in circles. Iron Man gets to his feet and fires a
repulse blast at Thor, then flies at him, kicking him
through a tree.

Thor stands, summoning a bolt of lightning as Loki watches
in the distance. Thor sends the bolt at Iron Man.

INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET:

JARVIS

TONY
How bout that?

BACK TO SCENE:

Iron Man fires at Thor. The two stand ready then fly at each
other, smashing through the trees and scraping up a cliff
side.

Trees are toppled as they crash to the forest grounds. Thor
and Iron Man stand quickly. Thor sends in a left hook so
Iron Man is about to punch but Thor grabs his fist. Iron Man
is about to send in his left hook and Thor grabs that too.

Thor begins to crush Iron Man’s right gauntlet with ease.

INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET:

Tony looks at the HUD which is alerting him. He groans and
thinks.

BACK TO SCENE:

Iron Man lifts his palm, that is being crushed, and he fires
a blast at Thor’s face -- it does nothing to Thor so he head
butts him. Thor headbutts him back. Iron Man flies back,
coming to a stop before launching himself at Thor.

Iron Man throws Thor into a broken tree. Thor then stands
and the two go at it for a bit longer -- a fist fight. Thor
summons his hammer about to slam down on the chest of Tony
but Iron Man ditches, causing Thor to fall.

Behind the rising Thor, Iron Man swoops in and punches him.
They get ready to sends blows at each other until Cap’s
shield ricochets off both their chest.

CAPTAIN AMERICA (O.S)
Hey!

Cap catches his shield.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
That’s enough!

He jumps down of the tree and approaches Thor and Iron Man.
Now I don’t know what you plan on
doing here-

THOR
I’ve come here to put an end to
Loki’s schemes!

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (4)

CAPTAIN AMERICA
Then prove it. Put that hammer
down.

IRON MAN
Uh, yeah! No! Bad call, he loves
his hammer-

Thor swings his hammer back, sending Iron Man behind him.

THOR
You want me to put hammer down?

Thor leaps, swinging Mjolnir, Cap raises the shield over his
head. When the two connect there is a loud boom and a flash
of light. The three are thrown backwards. They slowly get to
their feet and come together.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
Are we done here?

Thor looks around.

Banner is working. Loki smiles through the window at him.
Banner removes his glasses and rubs his temples.

Loki is locked in a cylindrical glass cage. Fury walks in
and over to a control panel.

FURY
In case it’s unclear, you try to
escape- you so much as scratch that
glass-

Fury pushes a button and the floor beneath the cell drops
away to nothing, the wind screams.
Thirty thousand feet straight down
in a steel trap. You get how that
works?

He pushes a button and closes the floor. He gestures first
to Loki.
Ant. (gestures to panel) Boot.

LOKI
It’s an impressive cage. Not built,

camera)...

INT. CONFERENCE TABLE, BRIDGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS

On the glass table a monitor is up -- Loki on it, watching
it is Natasha. As Loki talks she looks up at Banner. Banner
looks at her, smirking about her cage comment earlier.
...A mindless beast- makes play
he’s still a man...

We see Thor listen intently.
...How desperate are you, that you
call on such lost creatures to
defend you?

FURY (V.O)
How desperate am I?...

77
INT. CYLINDRICAL GLASS CAGE, CARRIER - CONTINUOUS (NIGHT) 77

Fury moves toward the cage slowly.
...You threaten my world with war,
you steal a force you can’t hope to
control, you talk about peace and
you kill ’cause it’s fun. You have
made me very desperate. You might
not be glad that you did.

LOKI
Ooh. It burns you to have come so
close, to have the Tesseract, to
have power- unlimited power, and
for what? (smiles and faces the
camera) A...

wants a magazine or something.

Fury exits.

The monitor on Cap’s side of the table turns off. Steve, in
suit with no cowl, looks up.

BANNER
He really grows on you doesn’t he?

STEVE
Loki’s gonna drag this out. So,
Thor, what’s his play?

THOR
He has an army called the Chitauri.
They’re not of Asgard nor any world
known. He means to lead the against
your people. They will win him the
Earth, in return, I suspect, for
the Tesseract.

STEVE
An army, from outer space?

BANNER
So, he’s building another portal.
That’s what he needs Erik Selvig
for.

THOR
Selvig?

BANNER
He’s an astrophysicist.

THOR
He’s a friend.

(CONTINUED)


CONTINUED: (2)

NATASHA
Loki has them under some kind of
spell- along with one of ours.

STEVE
I wanna know why Loki let us take
him. He’s not leading an army from
here.

BANNER
I don’t think we should be focusing
on Loki. That guy’s brain is a bag
full of cats, you can small crazy
on him.

THOR
Have care how you speak. Loki is
beyond reason but he is of Asgard,
and he is my brother.

NATASHA
He killed eighty people in two
days.

THOR
He’s adopted?

BANNER
I think it’s about the mechanics.
Iridium, what do they need the
Iridium for?

Tony and Coulson come walking in.

TONY
It’s a stabilizing agent.
(to Coulson, quietly)
I’m saying, take a weekend; I’ll
fly you to Portland. Keep love
alive.

Coulson peels off from Tony, who is heading over to Thor.
Means the portal won’t collapse on
itself like it did at SHIELD.
(to Thor)
No hard feelings point break, you
got a mean swing.

Thor gives Tony a look as he walks to the control panels.

TONY
Also, means the portal can open as
wide and stay open as long as Loki
wants.

(to SHIELD personnel)
Ah, raise the mizzen mast, ship the
topsails.

The personnel look at him strangely.
That man is playing Galaga! Thought
we wouldn’t notice, but we did.

Standing now at the command area of the ship, Tony covers
one eye.
(to Hill)
How does Fury even see these?

MARIA HILL
(attitude)
He turns!

TONY
Sounds exhausting!

He begins messing with the screens, sticking something to
the underside of a desk.
The rest of the raw materials,
Agent Barton can get his hands on
pretty easily. Only major component
he still needs is a power source-
of high energy density. Something
to- kick start the Cube.

MARIA HILL
When did you become an expert in
thermonuclear astrophysics?

TONY
Last night. The packet, Selvig’s
notes, the extraction theory
papers- am I the only one who did
the reading?

STEVE
Does Loki need any particular kind
of power source?

BANNER
He’s have to heat the Cube to a
hundred and twenty million kelvin
just to break through the Coulomb
barrier.

TONY
Unless, Selvig has figured out how
to stabilize the Quantum Tunneling
effect.

BANNER
Well, if he could do that he could
achieve heavy-ion fusion at any
reactor on the planet.

TONY
Finally. Someone who speaks
English.

STEVE
(to the others)
Is that what just happened?

Stark and Banner shake hands.

TONY
It’s good to meet you, Doctor
Banner. Your work on
anti-electronic collisions is
unparalleled. And I’m a huge fan of
the way you- lose control and turn
into an enormous green rage
monster.

BANNER
...Thanks.

Fury enters.

FURY
Doctor Banner is only here to track
the Cube. I was hoping you might
join him.

STEVE
I’d start with that stick of his.
It may be magical but it works an
awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.

FURY
I don’t know about that, but it is
powered by the Cube. And I like to
know how Loki used it to turn two
of the sharpest men I know into his
personal flying monkeys.

THOR
Monkeys? I do not understand-

STEVE
I do!

The entire room goes instantly silent, staring at Steve.

Banner and Stark are working on tracking the Cube. Banner is
scanning the scepter with a device.

BANNER
The Gamma readings are definitely
consistent with Selvig’s reports on
the Tesseract. But it’s gonna take
weeks to process.

Stark works on a screen.

TONY
If we bypass their mainframe and
direct route to the Homer cluster
we can clock this at around six
hundred teraflops.

BANNER
All I packed was a toothbrush.

TONY
(giggles a bit)
You know, you should come by Stark
Tower some time. Top ten floors-
all R and D. You’d love it, it’s a
candy land.

BANNER
Thanks but...last time I was in New
York I kind of broke...Harlem.

TONY
Well, I promise a stress free
environment. No tension, no
surprises.

STEVE
Hey!

TONY
Nothing?

Steve approaches.

STEVE
Are you nuts?

TONY
Jury’s out!
(to Banner)
You really have got a lid on it,
haven’t you? What’s your secret?
Mellow jazz, bongo drums, huge bag
of weed?

STEVE
Is everything a joke to you?

TONY
Funny things are.

STEVE
Threatening the safety of everyone
on this ship isn’t funny. No
offense, Doc.

BANNER
No it’s alright. I wouldn’t have
come aboard if I couldn’t handle
pointy things.

TONY
You’re tip-toeing, big man. You
need to strut.

STEVE
And you need to focus on the
problem, Mister Stark.

TONY
You think I’m not? Why did Fury
call us in? Why now, why not
before? What isn’t he telling us? I
can’t do the equation unless I have
all the variables.

STEVE
You think Fury’s hiding something?

TONY
He’s a spy. Captain, he’s the spy.
His secrets have secrets.

He gestures to Banner.
It’s bugging him to, isn’t it?

BANNER
Uh, Aah, I just wanna finish my
work here and-

STEVE
Doctor?

BANNER
A warm light for all mankind,"
Loki’s jab at Fury about the Cube.

STEVE
I heard it.

BANNER
Well, I think that was meant for
you.

He gestures to Stark, who offers him a blueberry.
Even if Barton didn’t tell Loki
about the tower, it was still all
over the news.

STEVE
The Stark Tower? That big ugly-

Stark gives him a look.
-building in New York?

BANNER
It’s powered by an arc reactor,
self-sustaining energy source. That
building will run itself for, what,
a year?

TONY
It’s just the prototype.
(to Rodgers)
I’m kind of the only name in clean
energy right now, that’s what he’s
getting at.

(CONTINUED)

BANNER
So, why didn’t SHIELD bring him in
on the Tesseract project? What are
they even doing in the energy
business in the first place?

TONY
I should probably look into that as
soon as my decryption program
finishes breaking into all of
SHIELD’s secure files.

STEVE
I’m sorry did you say-

TONY
JARVIS has been running it since I
hit the bridge. In a few hours I’ll
know every dirty secret SHIELD has
ever tried to hide. Blueberry?

STEVE
Yet you’re confused about why they
didn’t want you around.

TONY
An intelligence organization that
fears intelligence? Historically,
not awesome.

STEVE
I think Loki’s trying to wind us
up. This is a man who means to
start a war and if we don’t stay
focused he’ll succeed. We have
orders, we should follow them.

TONY
Following’s not really my style.

STEVE
And you’re all about style, aren’t
you?

TONY
Out of the people in this room,

That’s the guy my dad never shut up
about? Wondering if they shouldn’t
have kept him on ice.

BANNER
Guy’s not wrong about Loki, he does
have the jump on us.

TONY
What he’s got is an ACME dynamite
kit. It’s gonna blow up in his
face, and I’m gonna be there when
it does.

BANNER
I’ll read all about it.

TONY
Mhm, or, you’ll be suiting up with
the rest of us.

BANNER
Now, you see I don’t get a suit of
armor. I’m exposed, like a nerve,
it’s a nightmare.

TONY
You know, I’ve got a cluster
shrapnel, trying every second to
crawl its way into my heart. This
stops it-

He taps the arc reactor.
-this little circle of light. It’s
part of me now, not just armor.
It’s a terrible privilege.

But you can control it.

So you’re saying that the Hulk- the
Other Guy- saved my life? That’s

Coulson and Thor begins walking, through the bridge.

AGENT COULSON
He talks about you a lot. You
changed his life. You changed
everything around here.

THOR
They were better as they were. We
pretend on Asgard that we’re more
advanced, but we- we come here
battling like Bildschneip.

AGENT COULSON
Like what?

THOR
Bildschneip. You know, huge, scaly,
big antlers. You don’t have those?

AGENT COULSON
No.

THOR
Huh! Well they are repulsive, and
they trample everything in their
path.

Thor moves over to a large window.
When I first came to earth, Loki’s
rage followed me here and your
people paid the price. And now
again. In my youth I courted war.

FURY
War hasn’t started yet. You think
you can make Loki tell us where the
Tesseract is?

I do not know. Loki’s mind is far
afield, it’s not just power he
craves, it’s vengeance upon me.
There’s no pain would prise his

Before I worked for SHIELD, I uh-
well, I made a name for myself. I
have a very specific skill set. I
didn’t care who I used it for, or
on. I got on SHIELD’s radar in a
bad way. Agent Barton was sent to
kill me, he made a different call.

LOKI
And what will you do if I vow to
spare him?

NATASHA
Not let you out.

LOKI
Ah, no. But I like this. Your world
in the balance, and you bargain for

It’s really not that complicated. I
got red in my ledger. I’d like to
wipe it out.

LOKI
Can you? Can you wipe out that much
red? Drakov’s daughter? Sao Paulo?
The hospital fire? Barton told me
everything. Your ledger is
dripping, it’s gushing red, and you
think saving a man no more virtuous
than yourself will change anything?
This is the basest sentimentality.
This is a child, a prayer. Pathetic

Natasha becomes scared out of her mind.
And then he’ll wake just long

Natasha begins to exit the room.

NATASHA

You’re supposed to be locating the

BANNER
We are, the model’s locked and

Thor and Natasha enter. Banner looks to her.

BANNER
Did you know about this?

NATASHA
You wanna think about removing
yourself from this environment,

BANNER

THOR
Me?

FURY
Last year earth had a visitor from
another planet who had a grudge

hilariously, out-gunned.

THOR
My people want nothing but peace
with your planet.

FURY
But you’re not the only people out
there, are you? And, you’re not the
only threat. The world’s filling up
with people who can’t be matched,
they can’t be controlled.

STEVE
Like you controlled the cube!

THOR
Your work with the Tesseract is
what drew Loki to it, and his
allies. It is the signal to all the
realms that the earth is ready for
A HIGHER FORM OF WAR.

STEVE
A higher form?!

STEVE

He stops, everyone is staring at him.
I got low. I didn’t see an end so I

You wanna know my secret, Agent

Everyone is watching Banner, Fury and Natasha reach for

Banner looks down, surprised, to see the spear in his hand.
The monitor makes a noise, signaling the Tesseract has been

His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is
morphing to a growled threat. Banner begins to transform
into the Hulk, shirt tearing, he throws himself away from
Romanoff, who looks terrified, then he turns to look at her,
transforming -- just as the lights go out.

NATASHA
Bruce.

The transformation completes and Banner’s alter ego, the
Hulk, gets unsteadily to his feet, and roars. Romanoff
wrenches her foot free and stands looking -- and the Hulk
turns to look at her. She turns and runs up the catwalk
stairs as the Hulk chases her.

She swings over a catwalk, and rolls under a turbine, as the
Hulk tears down the stairs. Natasha jumps through small

Suddenly, the Hulk jumps at her, roaring. Romanoff fires her
gun at a pipe over his head and gas shoots out. She runs
along a narrow passage, the Hulk crashing through behind
her. He comes up on her fast. In slo-mo he catches up to her
as she is about to run off the passage -- he back hands her
against a wall.

scared. He raises a fist, about to strike, when he is

Natasha and Barton are still fighting. Natasha grabs Barton
arm and thrusts it back. He groans as he throws the dagger
to his free hand. Natasha grabs that hand too but he hoists
her against a wall.

Barton grabs Natasha’s hair and pulls, exposing her neck to
his dagger. Romanoff sinks her teeth into his arm and he
lets go, trying to force her down when she spins, throwing
Barton into the railing. He falls to the ground, groaning,
then looks up.

BARTON

Thor trying desperately to break free from the cell,

AGENT COULSON
You’re going to lose.

LOKI
Am I?

AGENT COULSON
It’s in your nature,

LOKI
your heroes are scattered, your
floating fortress falls from the
sky. Where is my disadvantage?

AGENT COULSON
You lack conviction.

LOKI
I don’t think I-

Coulson fires the weapon, which shoots a blast of fire
similar to that of the Destroyer, sending Loki flying
through a wall.

AGENT COULSON
So that’s what it does.

TONY
Cap hit the lever!

Cap still hangs from the side of the ship by a power cord.

STEVE

Cap hauls himself up.

Iron Man is pushed back up against one of the rotors, now
spinning too fast for him to escape.

INSIDE IRON MAN HELMET:

TONY (CONT’D)
Uh-oh.

BACK TO SCENE:

Iron Man is sucked into the blades and is spun wildly around

Steve, Tony, and Fury are gathered at a table. Hill stands
to the side.
Fury pulls a handful of cards out.

FURY
These were in Phil Coulson’s
jacket. Guess he never did get you
to sign them.

Fury scatters them on the table. Some are wet with blood.
We’re dead in the air up here. Our
communications, location of the
cube, Banner, Thor. I got nothing
for you. Lost my one good eye.
Think I had that coming.

Fury begins to make his way around the table to Steve and
Tony.
Yes, we were going to build an
arsenal with the Tesseract. I never
put all my chips on that number,
though, because I was playing
something even riskier. There was
an idea, Stark knows this, called
the Avengers Initiative.

Fury reaches a chair between Tony and Steve
The idea was to bring together a
group of remarkable people, see if
they could become something more.
See if they could work together
when we needed them to, to fight
the battles that we never could.
Phil Coulson died still believing
in that idea, in heroes.

Tony stands and walks out.
Well, it’s an old fashioned notion.

You fell out of the sky.

BANNER
Did I hurt anyone?

SECURITY GUARD
There’s nobody around here to get
hurt. You did scare the hell out of
some pigeons though.

BANNER
Lucky.

SECURITY GUARD
Or just good aim. You were awake
when you fell.

BANNER
You saw?

Banner steps down from the pile of rubble in the warehouse,
pulling on the shirt.

SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
So, which one is it?

BANNER
Sorry?

SECURITY GUARD
Are you a big guy that gets all
little, or a little guy that, ah-
sometimes blows up large?

BANNER
You know- I’m not even sure.

SECURITY GUARD
You got somewhere to go?

BANNER
Stark Tower. I- no.

The Security Guard looks at him.
Yes.

SECURITY GUARD
I’d expect some confusion of the
mind, since your body’s kind of all
over the place, but it has to be
one or the other.

The Security Guard gestures Banner to follow him.

BANNER
I know where I could do the most
good, but it’s where I can do the
most harm.

SECURITY GUARD
Well, that’s no different than
anybody else.

They walk out the doors.

Barton is strapped to a hospital bed. Natasha sits by him as
he strains against the bonds, breathing hard and shaking his
head.

NATASHA
Clint, you’re gonna be alright.

BARTON
You know that? Is that what you
know? I gotta go in though. I have
to flush him out.

NATASHA
You gotta level out, it’s gonna
take time.

BARTON
You don’t understand. Have you ever
had someone take your brain and
play? Pull you out and stuff
something else in? You know what
it’s like to be unmade?

NATASHA
You know that I do.

BARTON
Why am I back? How did you get him

NATASHA
Cognitive recalibration. I hit you
really hard in the head.

BARTON
Thanks.

Natasha begins to remove the strap restraints.
Natasha, how many agents?

NATASHA
Don’t. Don’t do that to yourself,
Clint. This is Loki. This is
monsters and magic and nothing we
were ever trained for.

BARTON
Loki. He get away?

NATASHA
Yeah. I don’t suppose you know
where?

BARTON
Didn’t need to know. Didn’t ask.
He’s gonna make his play soon
though. Today.

Natasha walks to the door.

NATASHA
We gotta stop him.

BARTON
Yeah? Who’s we?

NATASHA
I don’t know. Whoever is left.

BARTON
Well, if I put an arrow through
Loki’s eye socket I’d sleep better
I suppose.

NATASHA
Now you sound like you.

BARTON
But you don’t. You’re a spy, not a
soldier. Now you want to wade into
a war. Why? What did Loki do to
you?

NATASHA
He didn’t, I just-

STEVE
Was he married?

TONY
No. There was a uh- cellist, I
think.

STEVE
I’m sorry. He seemed like a good
man.

TONY
He was an idiot.

Tony and Steve slowly move toward each other.

STEVE
Why? For believing?

TONY
For taking on Loki alone.

STEVE
He was doing his job.

TONY
He was out of his league. He should
have waited. He should have-

STEVE
Sometimes there isn’t a way out,
Tony.

TONY
Right. How did that work for him?

a soldier?

TONY
We are not soldiers! I’m not

STEVE
Neither am I. He’s got the same
blood on his hands that Loki does,
but right now we gotta put that
behind us and get this done. Now
Loki needs a power source, if we
can put together a list-

Tony looks down at the place Coulson fell, there is a dent
in the wall.

TONY
He made it personal.

STEVE
That’s not the point.

TONY
That is the point. That’s Loki’s
point. He hit us all right where we
live. Why?

STEVE
To tear us apart.

TONY
Yeah, divide and conquer is great
but- he knows he has to take us out
to win, right? That’s what he
wants. He wants to beat us, he
wants to be seen doing it. He wants
an audience.

STEVE
Right. I caught his act in
Stuttgart.

TONY
Yeah. That’s just previews, this
is- this is opening night. And
Loki, he’s a full-tail diva. He
wants flowers, he wants parades, he

IRON MAN
Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

JARVIS
It’s too late! She can’t stop now.
She wants to show us something! A

IRON MAN

Okay.

He fires at the barrier around the device, but the Tesseract
deflects it, sending the energy outwards, knocking Selvig
out and Iron Man back.

JARVIS
The barrier is pure energy. It’s
unbreachable.

Yeah, I got that.

Iron Man looks down to see Loki on the platform outside the

LOKI
You should have left your armor on

TONY
Yeah, it’s seen a bit of mileage.
You’ve got the uh- blue stick of
destiny. Would you like a drink?

LOKI
Stalling me won’t change anything.

TONY
No, no, no- threatening. No drink?
You sure? I’m having one.

LOKI
The Chitauri are coming, nothing
will change that. What have I to
fear?

’Earth’s Mightiest Heroes’ type of
thing.

Loki turns away and Tony slips a pair of bracelets onto his
wrists.
A super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend;
a man with breath-taking anger
management issues; a couple of
master assassins, and you, big
fella, you’ve managed to piss off
every single one of them.

LOKI
That was the plan.

Tony begins to walk to the center of the penthouse where
Loki is.

TONY
Not a great plan. When they come,
and they will, they’ll come for
you.

LOKI
I have an army.

TONY
We have a Hulk.

LOKI
Oh, I thought the beast had
wandered off.

TONY
Yeah- you’re missing the point.
There’s no throne, there is no
version of this, where you come out
on top. Maybe your army comes and
maybe it’s too much for us, but
it’s all on you. ’Cause if we can’t
protect the earth, you can be
damned well sure we’ll avenge it.

Loki walks over to Tony, pointing his scepter.

LOKI
How will your friends have time for
me, when they’re so busy fighting
you?

Loki walks up to Tony, and places the tip of the scepter
over his heart. It clinks against the arc reactor.
This usually works.

Well, performance issues. You know?

stop his fall moments before he hits the ground and flies
back up to Loki at the window.

And there’s one other person you
pissed off! His name is Phil.

Iron Man fires a repulsor blast at Loki and he is knocked
down. Meanwhile the device has powered up and shoots a

three Chitauri aliens.

Cap leaves the other two fighting and jumps off an overpass,
rolling onto a bus and into the street.

Barton helps people off a bus as Natasha shoots her pistols

on his neck.

Natasha picks up a Chitauri weapon and is using it to fight
off the warriors. One warrior tries to slice her head off
and she slides, dodging it. She jumps to her feet and hits
it in the head with the sharp part of the weapon.

Barton knocks over another warrior. He grabs an arrow and
shoots behind himself, killing another warrior. He marches
over to another Chitauri and battles him. Meanwhile Natasha
is taking on three warriors by herself. She shoots one, then
spins around and stabs one in the neck.

Barton is tackled to the cement by a warrior. He groans and
stabs one with a arrow, then throws the warrior to the
ground. Out of nowhere, another Chitauri attacks him and
kicks him onto the trunk of a cab.

Natasha stabs a warrior with the Chitauri weapon. She hits
the other over the head. She spins to her knees, aims in one
direction, and fires. Another Chitauri charges, she spins
the weapon in that direction and fires. She continuously
fires as Barton fights more aliens in the background.

Barton’s head is slammed into the roof of a car. He is then
thrown to the ground by a warrior. He’s tired, but he
continues to fight.

Natasha takes on two more Chitauri. They back her onto a
taxi cab. They hit after her but she moves her head out of
the way. She gets her footing, and tries to hit them with
the weapon but a warrior grabs it and throws her feet into
the air. She lands on the car and screams in pain, breathing
heavily.

Barton shoots more warriors around them, they are becoming
overwhelmed but they keep on. Natasha regains her strength,
runs to the aid of Barton by firing at Chitauri as he slides
and shoots at Chitauri. Natasha and Barton are becoming
surrounded by Chitauri and Cap rejoins them -- hitting
Chitauri out the way. Thor drops down from the tower and
kills Chitauri with a bolt of lightening.

CAPTAIN AMERICA

THOR
I have unfinished business with
Loki.

BARTON

Oh yeah! Get in line.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
Save it. Loki’s gonna keep this
fight focused on us and that’s what
we need. Without him these things
could run wild. We got Stark up

He stops, seeing Banner arrive on a motorbike. Cap and the

Banner turns an begins to walk away, towards the Leviathan.

CAPTAIN AMERICA
Doctor Banner, now might be a

Banner transforms into the Hulk and punches the Leviathan,

perimeter. Anything gets more than
three blocks out, you turn it back
or you turn it to ash.

BARTON

Wanna give me a lift?

IRON MAN
Right. Better clench up, Legolas.

Iron Man grabs Barton and flies him up to the top of a

EXT. DEEP SPACE 

A dark 
screen 
is lit 
up by twinkling 
stars
. 

SON 
Baba? 

FATHER 

Yes, my son? 

SON 
Tell 
me a story
. 

FATHER 
Which one? 

SON 

The story 
of home . 

A meteorite 
drifts 
into 
frame , heading 
towards 
tiny 
Earth 
off 
in the distance. 

FATHER 

Millions 
of years 
ago , a meteorite 

made of vibranium, 
the strongest 
substance 
in the universe 
struck 
the continent 
of Africa 
affecting 
the plant 
life 
around 
it. 

The meteorite 
hits 
Africa 
and we see plant 
life 
and animals 
affected 
by vibranium. 

FATHER (CONT'D) 
And when the time of man came , five 
tribes 
settled 
on it 
and called 
it 

Wakanda. The tribes 
lived 
in 
constant 
war with 
each other 
until 

a warrior 
shaman received 
a vision 
from the Panther 
goddess 
Bast who 

led him to the Heart 
Shaped Herb, 
a 
plant 
that 
granted 
him super 
human 
strength
, speed, 
and instincts
. 

A visual 
representation 
of the 
five 
tribes 
emerges 
as hands 

from the 
sand animation, 
and we see them unite
, and then 
break 
apart 
as conflict 
arises
. Bashenga 
rises 
above the 
conflict 
and eats 
the Heart 
Shaped Herb, 
proceeding 
to unite 
the tribes
. 

FATHER (CONT'D) 
The warrior 
became King and the 
first 
Black Panther
, the protector 
of Wakanda . 

(MORE) 


FATHER (CONT'D) 
Four tribes 
agreed 
to live 
under 
the King's 
rule
, but the 
Jabari 
tribe 
isolated 
themselves 
in the 
mountains
. 

2 . 

We see the 
Jabari 
striding 
off 
towards 
the 
isolated 
mountain 

region. 

FATHER (CONT'D) 
The Wakandans 
used vibranium 
to 

develop 
technology 
more advanced 
than 
any other 
nation
, but 
as 

Wakanda thrived 
the world 
around 
it 

descended 
further 
into 
chaos . 

We see images 
of war and slavery 
just 
outside 
Wakanda ' s 
secretive 
border
. 

FATHER (CONT'D) 
To keep vibranium 
safe
, the 

Wakandans 
vowed to hide 
in plain 
sight, 
keeping 
the 
truth 
of their 
power from the 
outside 
world. 

We see the 
protective 
barrier 
rise 
around 
the 
Wakandan city
, 

as we pull 
back on the 
Earth 
as it 
spins, 
now zooming 
in on 
another 
part 
of the world ..• 

SON 
And we still 
hide 
Baba? 

FATHER 
Yes . 

SON 

Why?

An African 
man , N'JOBU (30s) 
sorts 
through 
firearms 
and goes 
over maps with 
another 
man , JAMES (20s , African 
American). 

Live news footage 
of the

N'JOBU 
Hey look , if we get in and out

Suddenly, 
N'Jobu 
hears 
something 
that 
we don't ... 
a familiar 
sound. 

N'JOBU (CONT'D) 

Hide the 
straps. 

James quickly 
moves into 
action, 
hiding 
the 
guns in the walls 
as N'Jobu 
peers 
out a window , then 
clears 
the maps from the 
table 
and unrolls 
a tapestry 
on the wall , hiding 
a bulletin 

board. 
James cocks 
a handgun. 

JAMES 
Is it 
the 
Feds? 

N'JOBU 
No. 

A KNOCK rattles 
the door . 

James walks 
over and looks 
out of a peep hole, 
then 
turns 
back with 
a confused 
expression
. 

JAMES 
It's 
two Grace Jones 
looking 
chicks •.. 
they're 
holding 
spears . . . 

N'JOBU 

Open it. 

JAMES 

You serious? 

N'JOBU 
They won't 
knock again . 

James opens the door and TWO DORA MILAJE (members of the All 
Female Wakandan Special 
Forces) 
slowly 
enter 
carrying 
LARGE 
SPEARS. They eye N' Jobu. 

DORA MILAJE 1 (SUBTITLE) 
(in Xhosa) 

Who are 
you? 

N'JOBU 

Prince 
N'Jobu , son of Azzuri
. 


DORA MILAJE 1 
(in Xhosa) 
Prove to me you are one of us .

N'Jobu 
grabs 
his bottom 
lip 
and flips 
it, 
revealing 
a 
vibranium 
threaded 
TATTOO glowing 
blue 
with Wakandan script. 
The Dora SWIFTLY SLAM their 
spears 
down in unison
, making the 
sound of an EMP. All electronics 
in the 
room instantly 
DIE 
OUT. 

INT. N'JOBU'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 

The room is pitch 
black , then .. . BOOM. The Dora hit 
the 
floor 
with their 
spears 
again 
and the 
lights 
come back ON, but now 
YOUNG T' CHAKA (dressed 
in t he ceremonial 
garb of the Black 
Panther) 
stands 
before 
them . 

N'Jobu 
kneels 
at the 
sight 
of him . He swats 
James , urging 
him 
to do the 
same . 

N'JOBU 
(in Xhosa) 
My King . .. 

Young T'Chaka 
looks 
at James , who gapes 
in awe . 

YOUNG T'CHAKA 
Leave us . 

N'JOBU 
This is James . I trust 
him with my 
life
. He stays
, with 
your 
permission
, King T'Chaka . 

Young T'Chaka 
looks 
at him for a long beat . 

YOUNG T' CHAKA 
As you wish . At ease .•. 

Young T' Chaka removes 
his mask , hands it 
off 
to the Dora and 
the women step 
out into 
the hall
, closing 
the 
door behind 
them . 

YOUNG T' CHAKA (CONT'D) 
(in Xhosa) 
Come baby brother
. 

(in English) 
Let me see how you're 
holding 
up . 

N'Jobu 
stands. 
T'Chaka 
walks 
over to him and they 
embrace. 

YOUNG T'CHAKA (CONT' D) 
You look strong
. 


N'JOBU 
Glory to Bast . I am in good health. 
How is home? 

Young T'Chaka's 
mood darkens. 

YOUNG T'CHAKA 
Not so good , baby brother. 
There 
has been an attack. 

Then , Young T'Chaka 
activates 
a simple 
looking 
beaded 
bracelet, 
KIMOYO BEADS, that 
project 
a hologram 
image of 
ULYSSES KLAUE. 

YOUNG T'CHAKA (CONT'D) 
This man, Ulysses 
Klaue , stole 
a 
quarter 
ton of vibraniurn 
from us 
and triggered 
a bomb at the border 
to escape . Many lives 
were lost
. He 
knew where we hid the vibranium, 
and how to strike
. 

N'Jobu 
takes 
the news in . 

YOUNG T'CHAKA (CONT'D) 
He had someone on the inside. 

5 . 

Young T'Chaka 
waits 
for N' Jobu to come clean 
of the crime . He 
doesn't
. 

N'JOBU 
Why are you here? 

YOUNG T'CHAKA 
Because 
I want you look me in the 
eyes and tell 
me why you betrayed 
Wakanda . 

N' JOBU 
I did no such thing
. 

Young T'Chaka 
snaps 
a look to James . 

YOUNG T' CHAKA (SUBTITLE) 
(in Xhosa) 
Tell 
him who you are. 

JAMES 
Zuri, 
Son of Badu . 

N'JOBU 
What? 


6 . 

N'Jobu's 
face 
goes ashen 
as James is revealed 
to be YOUNG 
ZURI, a Wakandan spy . Zuri reveals 
his vibranium 
lip 
tattoo
. 

N'Jobu 
grabs 
him . 

N'JOBU (CONT'D) 
James, 
James you lied 
to me? I 
invite 
you into 
my home and you 

were Wakandan this 
whole time? 

JAMES (ZURI) 

You betrayed 
Wakanda! 

N'JOBU 

How could 
you lie 
to me like 
-

YOUNG T'CHAKA 

Stand down. Did you think 
that 
you 
were the only 
spy we sent 
here? 

Zuri walks to the wall 
and removes 
a duffle 
bag containing 

VIBRANIUM CANISTERS, glowing 
blue . He shows one to Young 
T'Chaka . 

YOUNG T'CHAKA (CONT'D) 
Prince 
N'Jobu, 
you will 
return 
home 
at once, 
where you will 
face 
the 
council 
and inform 
them of your 
crimes
.

Though it 
remains 
one of the 
poorest 
countries 
in the world, 

fortified 
by mountain 
ranges 
and an 
impenetrable 
rain 
forest, 
Wakanda 

does not engage 
in international 
trade 
or accept 
aid . The succession 
of the throne 
is expected 
to fall 
to the oldest 
of the King's 
two 
children
, Prince 
T'Challa

She moves towards 
the back of the craft
. 

T'CHALLA 

No need, 
Okoye. I can handle 
this 

alone . 

Okoye pauses, 
then 
returns 
her spear 
to the wall . T'Challa 
closes 
the model and steps 
to a marked circle 
in the 
floor. 

T'CHALLA (CONT' D) 
I will 
get Nakia out as quickly

Okoye places 
six KIMOYO BEADS into

The militants 
move slowly 
following 
every

their 
guns at the base

rushes 
out , 

firing

to no effect. 
Then , as Panther 
walks 
towards 
him, Nakia dives 
out , kicking 
the young militant's 
gun from his 
hand and grabs 
him in a neck-lock. 

Swinging 
around , Nakia kicks 
Panther 
in the chest, 
stopping 
his momentum. Caught off

Panther 
freezes

Nakia pulls

Nakia , T'Challa 
and Okoye regard 
a BEAUTIFUL RAINFOREST that 
expands 
for 
as far 
as the 
eye can see . 

Okoye dives 
the pl ane seemingly 
right 
into 
THE TREES . . . when 

at the 
last 
moment it 
passes 
through
, revealing 
the 
forest 
is 
a massive 
hologram

EXT. THE GOLDEN CITY, CAPITAL OF WAKANDA

A sprawling 
metropolis 
with 
elaborate 
veins 
of public

The RTF heads 
for 
the 
ROYAL PALACE, a magnificent 
building 
at 
the center 
of the

down on the 
landing 
pad. 

EXT. LANDING PAD, ROYAL PALACE/INT. RTF - BREAKING DAWN 

RAMONDA (S0s, 
Queen Mother of Wakanda), 
and SHUR! (18 , 

Princess 
of Wakanda) 
stand 
on the 
pad flanked 
by AYO. 

Okoye , Nakia 
and T'Challa 
exit 
the 
RTF and Nakia 
bows her 
head . 

NAKIA 

Queen Mother . . . Princess
. My 
comfort 
for your 
loss. 

RAMONDA 

Thank you , Nakia. 
It 
is so good to 

have you back with 
us . 

Nakia nods. 

OKOYE 
(to Ayo) 
Take her to the 
River 
Province 
to 
prepare 
her for the 
ceremony . 

AYO 
Yes, general
. 

Ayo nods and walks 
off 
with 
Nakia while 
Shuri 
watches 
closely
. 

SHUR! 
Did he freeze? 

OKOYE 
Like an antelope 
in headlights. 

Shuri 
laughs 
at this
. 

T' CHALLA 
Are you finished? 

Okoye slams 
her spear 
into 
the 
ground , signaling 
the 
rest 
of 
the Dora to follow 
her off . 

T'Challa 
turns 
to Shuri
. 

T'CHALLA (CONT'D) 
So surprised 
my little 
sister 
came 
to see me off 
before 
our big day . 


SHUR! 
You wish . I'm here 
for 
the EMP 
beads, 
I've 
developed 
an update. 

T'CHALLA 
Update? 
No, it 
worked perfectly
. 

SHUR! 
How many times 
to I have to teach 
you, 
just 
because 
something 
works , 

doesn't 
mean that 
it 
cannot 
be 
improved . 

T' CHALLA 
(teasing) 

You are teaching 
me, what do you 
know? 

14. 

Shuri 
holds 
out her hand and T'Challa 
drops 
the beads 
into 
her hand . Shuri 
heads 
off . 

T'CHALLA (CONT'D) 
I cannot 
wait 
to see what kind of 
update 
you make to your ceremonial 
outfit. 

Shuri 
flips 
him off . 

RAMONDA 
Shuri! 

T'Challa 
smiles 
at this
. 

SHUR! 
Sorry mother . 

Ramonda turns 
to T'Challa
. 

T'CHALLA 
How are you feeling 
today, 
mama? 

RAMONDA 

Proud ... 
your father 
and I would 

talk 
about

He is with us , and it

INT. WEST AFRICAN EXHIBIT - MOMENTS LATER 

We see a black 
man in high-end 
street 
wear , around 
30 years 
old . A RING hangs 
on a gold chain 
around 
his 
neck . This 
is 
ERIK KILLMONGER
. 

Killmonger 
stands 
dangerously 
close 
to the glass 
containing 
SEVERAL WEST AFRICAN ARTIFACTS. They range 
from what looks 
like 
iron 
gardening 
tools 
to masks and short 
range 
weapons. 

Flanking 
the room are TWO SECURITY GUARDS, slight
l y unnerved 
by his presence
. 

We follow 
the MUSEUM DIRECTOR, a British 
woman (mid-40's) 
as 
she enters 
and walks 
up behind 
Killmonger 
as he studies 
t he 
war masks . 

MUSEUM DIRECTOR 
Good morning ! How can I help 
you? 

KILLMONGER 
I was just 
checking 
out these 
artifacts
. They tell 
me you're 
the 
expert
. 

MUSEUM DIRECTOR 
You could 
say that. 

KILLMON 
GER 
They're 
beautiful
. 

Killmonger 
points 
at one of the masks . 

KILLMONGER (CONT'D) 
Where's 
this 
one from? 

MUSEUM DIRECTOR 
From the Bobo Ashanti 
Tribe , 

prese nt day Ghana . 19th Century
. 

KILLMON 
GER 
For real? 
What about 
this 
one? 

MUSEUM DIRECTOR 
That one's 
from the Edo people 
of 
Benin . 16th Century
. 

KILLMONGER 
Now, tell 
me about 
this 
one . 

Killmonger 
points 
to a MINING TOOL off 
to the 
side. 


MUSEUM DIRECTOR 
Also from Benin . 7th Century. 
Fula 
tribe 
I believe
. 

KILLMONGER 
Nah. 

MUSEUM DIRECTOR 

(amused) 

I beg your pardon? 

KILLMONGER 
It was taken 
by British 
soldiers 
in 
Benin but it's 
from Wakanda and 
it's 
made out of vibranium
. Don't 
trip, 
I'mma take 
it 
off your hands 
for you. 

She looks 
at Killmonger 
like 
he's 
crazy . 

MUSEUM DIRECTOR 
These items 
aren't 
for sale. 

KILLMONGER 
How do you think 
your ancestors 
got 

these? 
You think 
they 
paid 
a fair 
price? 
Or did they 
take 
it 
like 
they 
took everything 
else
. 

MUSEUM DIRECTOR 

Sir , I'm going to have to ask you 
to leave
. 

16. 

The Museum Director 
subtly 
looks 
back at the 
security 
guards
, 

then makes a face 
and touches 
her stomach 
--
indigestion
. 

Killmonger 
smiles 
and leans 
over, 
whispering 
in her ear . 

KILLMONGER 
You got all 
this 
security 
watching 

me ever 
since 
I walked 
in. 
But , you 

ain't 
checking 
for what you put in 

your body . 

The museum director 
looks 
at Killmonger 
in terror 
as a 
security 
guard walks 
up behind 
him . 

SECURITY GUARD 

Alright, 
mate. 
Let's 
have it . Come 
on , mate. 

KILLMON 
GER 

I think 
she might 
not be feelin' 

too good . 


17. 

The Museum Director 
suddenly 
slumps to the 
floor, 
clutching 
her stomach . 

KILLMONGER (CONT'D) 
Hey! Hey somebody get some help ! 
Come here! 
Call 
a doctor, 
please! 
Hey please, 
somebody come help ! 

The security 
guards 
quickly 
rush to the museum director's 
aid . 

SECURITY GUARD 
(into 
radio) 
Medical 
Emergency right

West African

Killmonger 
stands 
back and looks 
toward 
the door. 

I NT. CAFE, BRITISH MUSEUM - MORNING 

LINDA, A young black 
barista
, looks 
on as TWO EMTs push a 
STRETCHER through 
the entrance
. They head towards 
the West 
African 
Exhibit
. 

LINDA 
I'm gonna take 
a break. 

Preoccupied 
with 
the commotion, 
her co-worker 
nods and Linda 
walks out . 

INT. WEST AFRICAN EXHIBIT, BRITISH MUSEUM - MOMENTS LATER 

The EMTs rush 
in, 
revealing 
the

of the 
lead 
paramedic ... 

IT'S ULYSSES KLAUE (Afrikaans

Another 
EMT, LIMBANI, mans the door . 

KLAUE 

Let's

LIMBANI 
Step back please,

Museum-goers 
quickly 
bee l ine for the

the guards.

Uneasy, 
the 
security 
guards 
follow 
Klaue's 
instructions 
only 
to have KLAUE AND LIMBANI draw silenced 
pistols 
and rapidly 
shoot 
two of the 
three 
dead . Klaue 
looks 
at the 
one 
remaining. 

KLAUE 
Hey come here. 
Come here! 
It ' s ok. 
You can go , but 
just 
don't 
tell 
anyone , alright? 

The SECURITY GUARD looks 
back at him unsure, 
then 
takes 
off . 

Klaue then 
aims and shoots 
the 
Security 
Guard in the back . 

Killmonger 
looks 
on at him confused
. 

KILLMONGER 
Bro, why you 'aint 
just 
shoot 
him 

right 
here? 

KLAUE 

Because 
it's 
better 
to leave 
the 
crime 
scene 
more spread 
out . . . makes

The LENS on a surveillance

Klaue 
looks 
down at the 
slumped 
bodies 
of the 
guards. 
Turns 
to Killmonger. 

KLAUE 
Now ... let's 
see if you know what 
you're 
talking 
about .. . 

Klaue removes 
his 
glove 
to reveal 
a BIONIC PROSTHETIC hand . 


19 . 

Klaue walks 
up to the PROTECTIVE GLASS surrounding 
a smaller 
case 
containing 
the mining 
tool 
and places 
his 
hand on it . An 
invisible 
charge 
SHATTERS the 
glass. 

KLAUE (CONT' D) 
That's 
just 
a taste
. 

Klaue picks 
up the MINING HAMMER
, studying 
it . The tool 
doesn't 
look 
like 
anything 
special
. 

Klaue ' s hand SIZZLES BLUE and centuries 
of MUCK and GRUNGE 
drop off 
the 
hammer revealing 
that 
it's 
pure 
vibraniurn
. Klaue 
smells 
it , and smiles. 

KLAUE (CONT'D) 
Whoo ..• 
You 'r e gonna be rich
, boy . 

KILLMON 
GER 
You better 
sel l that 
quick
. 

KLAUE 
Oh it's 
already 
sold . 

Klaue waves Lirnbani 
over with 
the 
stretcher 
to load 
the 
hammer inside
. He BREAKS the WOODEN HANDLE off 
the 
tool
, 

taking 
only 
the 
vibranium 
head . 

KILLMONGER 
Whatever 
you try , the 
Wakandans ' ll 
probably 
show up . 

KLAUE 
That ' ll 
make my day . I can kill 
two 
birds 
with 
one stone

Lirnbani 
approaches 
Killmonger 
who eyes 
a third 
MASK, expertly 
crafted 
and slightly 
haunting
. He slides 
th e mask inside 
the 
stretcher 
also. 

KLAUE (CONT'D) 
You're 
not tel l ing me that's 
vibranium 
too , eh? 

KILLMONGER 
Nah , I'm just

Killmonger 
lays 
atop

containing 
a mysterious 
concoction
. 

ZURI (CONT'D) 
The Prince 
will 
now have the

Zuri pours 
the 
solution 
into 
T'Challa's 
mouth . T'Challa 
reacts 
violently, 
choking 
on the red fluid. 

T'Challa 
spasms, 
his 
veins 
expanding 
and his muscles 
contracting 
as the poison 
spreads 
through 
him . But soon, 
he 

stops 
shaking 
and exhales 
easy .

As she raises 
her hand,

gasp is heard 
amongst the entire 
gathering
. 

SHUR! 
This corset 
is really 

uncomfortable. 
So could

Ramonda pinches

WARRIORS and TWO JABARI DRUMMERS

Adorned in

wooden spears

Zuri confronts 
M'Baku. 

ZURI 
M'Baku . What are you doing

M'BAKU 
It's 
challenge 
day . 

M'BAKU (CONT'D) 

We have watched 
and listened 
from 
the mountains
. We have watched 
with 
disgust
, as your technological 
advancements 
have been overseen 
by 
a child 
who scoffs 
at tradition
. 

23 . 

M'Baku points 
his 
spear 
at Shuri, 
who's 
eyes grow large
. AYO 

steps 
in front 
of her . 

M'BAKU (CONT'D) 
And now ... 
you want to hand the 

nation 
over to this 
prince .. . 

(he steps 
nose to nose 

with T'Challa) 

Who could 
not even keep his own 
father 
safe . Hmm? We will 
not have 
it . I said 
we will 
not have it !

wish to

I accept 
your challenge,

Glory to Hanuman . 


24. 

Zuri puts 
the Panther 
mask on T'Challa
. 

M'Baku grins 
and places 
a WOODEN GORILLA MASK over 
his 
face . 

He clenches 
his 
fist 
and calls 
out for his 
Jabari 
soldiers 
to 
form a semicircle 
behind 
him , pointing 
their 
spears 
at his 
back. 

T'Challa 
lifts 
his 
hand and calls 
out for the Dora, 
who fall 
into 
place 
behind 
him, making a perfect 
CIRCLE OF SPEARS 
surrounding 
the 
fighters. 

Zuri raises 
his 
hand, 
ill-at-ease
. 

ZURI 
Let the 
challenge 
begin! 

The warriors 
CLASH, both with 
great 
skill
. M'Baku with 

superior 
strength. 
T'Challa 
eludes 
a salvo 
of swings, 
then 
is 
driven 
back by the tip 
of M'Baku's 
spear 
against 
his 
shield. 

Knocking 
M'Baku's 
spear 
free, 
T'Challa 
is HAMMERED 
ONTO HIS 
BACK but instantly 
springs 
up to dodge more attacks 
and 
counter 
with 
TWO FIERCE KICKS. 

M'Baku spits 
blood 
and bangs his 
chest. 
The rest 
of the 
Jabari 
warriors 
RESPOND. T'Challa 
salutes 
the crowd and they 
respond 
LOUDER! 

M'Baku charges 
at T'Challa
, knuckle-walking
, and slipping 
his 
assault
, T'Challa 
grabs 
M'Baku's 
spear 
and cartwheels 
over 
it 
to land 
another 
KICK. 

The two continue 
to battle, 
BLOCKING and TRADING BLUNT 
STRIKES, until 
M'Baku delivers 
a backhand 
that 
KNOCKS 
T'CHALLA OFF HIS FEET near 
the Dora's 
spears. 

With the deadly 
spears 
at his back, 
T'Challa 
blocks 
COLOSSAL 
OVERHEAD BLOWS with 
his 
shield, 
then M' Baku leans 
with 
all 
his 
strength 
trying 
to impale 
T'Challa 
on the TIPS. 

Clubbing 
M'Baku to his 
heels
, T'Challa 
rushes 
forward 
for 
an 
aerial 
attack 
only to be met by a VICIOUS KICK to the chest
, 

causing 
him to LOSE both his 
shield 
and spear! 

M'BAKU 

Where is your God, now?! 

Defenseless, 
T'Challa 
DODGES SPEAR-SWIPES before 
M'Baku 
corrals 
him into 
a BEAR HUG and delivers 
a CRUSHING HEADBUTT. 

M'Baku LAUGHS through 
his mask . 


M'BAKU (CONT' D) 
No powers . No claws . No specia l 
suit, 
oh ! Just 
a boy, 
not fit

T'Challa 
finds 
strength 
in RAMONDA'S VOICE. He shakes 
off 
the 

headbutt, 
stunning 
M'Baku with 
a SAVAGE ELBOW to free 

himself. 

M' Baku retaliates, 
GORING T'Challa's 
shoulder. 

ON SHUR! 

T'CHALLA 

I AM PRINCE T'CHALLA SON OF King 
T'CHAKA! l

You can do this

T'Challa 
wedges M'Baku ' s spear 
UNDER HIS FOOT and PULLS 
M'Baku to the pool , FLIPPING his 
body into 
a SERIES OF LEG 
CHOKES. 

M'Baku FIGHTS, but can't

Yield! 
Don't

you . 

M'BAKU 
I would rather 
die ! 

T'Challa 
TIGHTENS HIS GRIP and M'Baku begins 
to fade . 

T'CHALLA 

What would the proud Jabari 
do 
without 
you? 

T'Challa 
tightens 
further. 


T'CHALLA (CONT' D) 
You have fought 
with 
honor , now 
yield! 
Your people 
need you . 

M'Baku looks 
up at the 
Jabari 
warriors
. 

T'CHALLA (CONT'D) 
Yield, 
man ! 

M' Baku grudgingly 
reaches 
out 
and TAPS.

T'Cha l la lets

The crowd ERUPTS as struggling

ZURI 
I now present

My King . 

Drums begin

and pours 
it 
into 
T'Challa's 
mouth as he lies 

in a dirt

in the middle

ZURI 
Allow the Heart

T'Challa 
sees 
as his

EXT. BLACK PANTHER ANCESTRAL PLANE - UNKNOWN 

T'Challa 
comes out of the 
dirt
. There 
are 
stars 
above . He's 
in a VAST GRASSLAND somewhere 
in Wakanda with 
wondrous 
acacia 
trees
. It's 
surreal 
and beautiful. 


28 . 

A massive 
ACACIA TREE stands 
in front 
of him . T'Challa 
sees 
several 
YELLOW EYES looking 
at him and realizes 
PANTHERS are 
resting 
on the branches 
of the tree
. T'Challa 
approaches. 
A 
large 
panther 
jumps down, then 
stands 
on two feet 
to reveal 
it's 
T'CHAKA. 

T'Challa 
lo oks at his 
father 
and immediately 
pulls 
him into 
a 
hug. 

T'CHALLA 
Baba! 

T'CHAKA 
(in Xhosa) 
My son. 

T'Challa 
kneels 
down before 
his 
father
, overcome with 
grief. 

T'CHALLA 
I am sorry
. 

T'CHAKA 
Stand up! You are a King. 

T'Challa 
rises, 
and they 
begin 
to walk. 

T'CHAKA (CONT'D) 

(in Xhosa) 
What is wrong my son? 

T'CHALLA 
(in Xhosa) 
I am not ready, 
Baba. 

T'CHAKA 
(in Xhosa) 
Have you not prepared 
to be King 
your whole life? 
Have you not 
trained 
and studied, 
been by my 
side? 

T'CHALLA 
That is not what I am talking 
about . I am not ready 
to be without 
you. 

T'CHAKA 
A man who has not prepared 
his 
children 
for his 
own death 
has 
failed 
as a father. 
(beat) 
Have I ever 
failed 
you? 


T'CHALLA 
Never . 

(beat) 
Tell 
me how to best 
protect 
Wakanda. 
I want to be a great 
King, 
Baba . Just 
like 
you . 

T'CHAKA 
You're 
going to struggle. 
So you 

need to surround 
yourself 
with 
people 
you trust
. You're 
a good man 
with a good heart
. And it's 
hard 
for a good man to be King . 

INT. HALL OF KINGS, CITY OF THE DEAD - DUSK 

T'Challa 
is aggressively 
pulled 
from the dirt 
by Zuri. 

ZURI 

Breathe
, T'Challa. 
Breathe
! 

29 . 

T'Challa 
breathes 
in deeply , coughing 
up dirt
. His battle 

wounds have healed. 

T'CHALLA 
He was there
! He was there
. My 

father. 

EXT. STEP TOWN, GOLDEN CITY - DAY 

A bustling 
futuristic 
metropolis. 
T' Challa 
and Nakia stroll 
side 
by side . FOUR DORA MILAJE shadow them from a distance. 

T'CHALLA 

Corne home, Nakia . 

NAKIA 

I'm right 
here . 

T'CHALLA 
Stay. 

NAKIA 
I came to support 
you , and to honor 

your father. 
But I can't 
stay. 
It's 
just ... ! found my calling 
out 
there
. I've 
seen too many in need 
just 
to turn 
a blind 
eye . I can't 
be happy here 
knowing that 
there's 
people 
out there 
who have nothing
. 

T'Challa 
thinks 
on this
. 


T'CHALLA 
What would you have Wakanda do 
about 
it? 

Nakia thinks 
for 
a bit
. 

NAKIA 

Share what we have. 
We could 
provide 
aid and access 
to 
technology 
and refuge 
to those 
who 
need it ... 
other 
countries 
do it, 

we do it 
better. 

T' CHALLA 

We are not like 
these 
other 

countries, 
Nakia. 
If the world 

found out what we truly 
are, 
and 
what we possess 
--
we could 
lose 

our way of life. 

NAKIA 
Wakanda is strong 
enough to help 
others 
and protect 
ourselves 
at the 
same time . 

Nakia gives 
T'Challa 
a look . 

T'CHALLA 
If you were not so stubborn 
you 
would make such a great 
queen. 

NAKIA 

I would make a great 
queen because 
I am so stubborn
. 

T' CHALLA 

Ah! So you admit 
it ! 

NAKIA 

. .• if that's 
what I wanted ! 

EXT. WAKANDAN 
BORDER REGION - DAY 

30 . 

We TRACK PAST several 
Border 
Tribesmen 
in a field, 
feeding 
and watering 
their 
pet HORSES and GOATS. 

Finally 
we come upon . . . W'Kabi feeding 
M20, his 
MASSIVE PET 
RHINO by hand . T'Challa 
stands 
beside 
him . 

T'CHALLA 
Is that 
him? Glory to Bast, 
man, is 
he still 
growing? 


W'Kabi laughs
. 

W'KABI 
Of course. 

W'KABI (CONT'D) 
I see Nakia is back ... 
you guys 
going to work it 
out? 

T'Challa 
shakes 
his 
head and crosses 
in front 
of W'Kabi . 

W'KABI (CONT'D) 
T'Challa, 
what's 
wrong? 

T'CHALLA 

Nakia thinks 
we should 
be doing 

more . 

W'KABI 
More like 
what? 

T'CHALLA 
Foreign 
aid ... 
refugee 
programs. 

W'Kabi shakes 
his 
head. 

W'KABI 

You let 
refugees 
in , they 
bring 

their 
problems 
with 
them. 
And then 

Wakanda is like 
everywhere 
else. 

T'Challa 
thinks 
on this. 

W'KABI (CONT'D) 

Now, if you said 
you wanted me and 
my men to go out there 
and clean 
up 
the world , then 
I'd 
be all 
for 
it. 

T'CHALLA 

But waging war on other 
countries 
has never 
been our way . 

Then , both of their 
Kimoyo beads 
buzz. 

T' CHALLA (CONT'D) 
You too, 
huh? 

W'KABI 
Bast, 
are we in trouble? 

Their 
beads 
combine to project 
a display 
of Okoye . 

31. 


OKOYE (DISPLAY) 

My King . My love. 
You will 
never 
guess who just 
popped up on our 

radar. 

INT. TRIBAL COUNCIL ROOM - DAY 

32 . 

An ornate 
chamber overlooking 
the Golden City . At the top of 
a golden 
pyramid, 
T' Challa
, W'Kabi, 
Ramonda and ELDERS from 
each tribe 
except 
the Jabari 
sit 
in a circle 
as Okoye briefs 
them . W'Kabi and Ramonda flank 
T'Challa's 
throne
. 

OKOYE 

A misidentified 
Wakandan artifact 

was stolen 
yesterday 
from a British 

museum. We have learned 
Ulysses 
Klaue plans 
to sell 
the vibraniurn 

to an American 
buyer 
in South Korea 

tomorrow 
night
. 

There are audible 
murmurs at the name of Ulysses 
Klaue . 

T'CHALLA 
Klaue has escaped 
our pursuits 
for 
almost 
30 years. 
Not capturing 
him 
was perhaps 
my father's 
greatest 
regret
. I wish to bring 
Klaue back 

here to stand 
trial
. 

MERCHANT 
TRIBE ELDER 

Wakanda does not need a warrior 
right 
now. We need a King . 

W'KABI 
My parents 
were killed 
when he 
attacked
. Not a day goes by when I 
do not think 
about 
what Klaue took 

from us, 
from me. 

OKOYE 
It's 
too great 
an opportunity 
to 
pass. 

W'KABI 
Take me with you . We'll 
take 
him 

down together 
side 
by side, 
eh? 

T'CHALLA 

I need you here protecting 
the 
border. 


W'KABI 
Then I ask, 
you kill 
him where he 

stands
, or you bring 
him back to 
us . 

T'CHALLA 
You have my word I will 
bring 
him 
back. 
(beat) 
We will 
proceed 
with 
the 
mission

Ramonda looks

A DRAGONFLYER lands

T'Challa 
walks 
with 
four 
Dora , including 
Ayo. The Dora stop 
outside 
Shuri's 
Lab . 

As T'Challa 
pushes 
inside
, Shuri 
approaches 
and bows her 
head. 

SHUR! 
(mocking) 
My, King . 

T'CHALLA 
Stop 
it. 
Stop 
it. 

Shuri 
laughs 
and they 
do a special 
handshake 
before 
walking 
down the 
spiral 
walkway 
into 
her sprawling, 
futuristic 
lab. 

INT. SHURI'S LAB, WAKANDAN 
DESIGN GROUP - MOMENTS LATER 

Nexus of technology

strolls 
with 
T'Challa 
by work 

tables 
of high-tech 
weapons 
and gadgets. 

SHUR! 
I've 
already 
sent 
a car 
ahead 
to 
Busan for 
you . 

(beat) 

Who are 
you taking 
with 
you to 
Korea? 


T'CHALLA 
Okoye. And Nakia as well. 

Shuri 
makes a face 
at Nakia . 

SHURI 
You sure 
it's 
a good idea 
to take 
your ex on a mission? 

T'CHALLA 
Yes . We'll 
be fine . 

(beat) 
Besides
, you will 
be on call
, 

should 
we need backup. 

Shuri 
smiles 
at this 
and points 
out smal l communications 
devices
. 

SHURI 
I have great 
things 
to show you , 

brother
. Here are your 
communication 
devices 
for Korea . 

Unlimited 
range , also 
equipped 
with 
audio 
surveillance 
system . 

34 . 

She walks 
him over to another 
table 
with WDG disks 
on them . 

SHURI (CONT'D) 
Check these 
out . Remote access 
Kimoyo beads. 
Updated 
to interface 
directly 
with my sand table
. 

Curious
, T'Chal l a notices 
a pair 
of SLEEK SHOES. 

T'CHALLA 
And what are these? 

SHURI 
The real 
question 
is what are 
those? 
Why do you have your toes 
out in my lab? 

Shuri 
points 
at T'Challa's 
traditional 
sandals
. T'Challa 
smiles
. 

T'CHALLA 
What , you don't 
like 
my royal 
sandals? 
I wanted to go old school 
for my first 
day . 

SHURI 
(rolls 
her eyes) 
Yea I bet the 
elders 
loved 
that
. 

Try them on . 


T'Challa 
puts 
his 
feet 
into 
the 
shoes , and they 
lace 
up 

instantly
, forming 
a perfect 
fit. 

SHURI (CONT'D) 

Fully 
automated
, like 
the old 
American movie Baba used to watch. 
And I made them completely 
sound 
absorbent
. 

T'Challa 
stomps his 
foot 
down without 
a sound. 

T'CHALLA 
Interesting 
•.• 

SHURI 
Guess what I ca l l them . 

T'Challa 
thinks 
on this
. 

SHURI (CONT'D) 
Sneakers ... 

T'Challa 
looks 
at her blankly
. 

SHURI (CONT'D) 
Because 
you .. . never 
mind. 

Shuri 
walks T'Challa 
over to two mannequins
. One wears 

T'Challa's 
CURRENT SUIT. The other
, just 
a panther 
tooth 
NECKLACE. 

SHURI (CONT'D) 
If you're 
going to take 
on Klaue 

you'll 
need the best 
the Design 
Group has to offer
. 

Shuri 
points 
at T'Challa's 
current 
suit
. 

SHURI (CONT'D) 

Exhibit 
A. Old tech . 

T'CHALLA 
Old ... ? 

Functional, 
but old . Eh , people 
are 
shooting 
at me .. . wait 
let 
me put 
on my helmet . . . 

T'Challa 
smiles, 
amused . 

T'CHALLA (CONT'D) 
Enough .. . 

35 . 


SHUR! 
(pointing 
to the necklace) 
Now look at these
. 

36. 

T'Challa 
spots 
a GAUDIER GOLD TOOTH NECKLACE. She notices
. 

SHUR! (CONT'D) 
Do you like 
that 
one? 

T'CHALLA 
Tempting . But the 
idea 
is to not be 

noticed
. This one . 

Shuri 
uses 
her Kimoyo beads 
to sync the 
suit 
to T'Challa. 

SHUR! 
(pointing 
at the necklace) 

Now tell 
it 
to go on. 

T'Challa 
does, 
and without 
warning, 
MILLIONS of vibranium 
laced 
NANITES spill 
from the necklace 
and form a new BLACK 
PANTHER SUIT around 
the mannequin. 

SHUR! (CONT'D) 
Oooh! ! The entire 
suit 
sits 
within 

the teeth 
of the necklace
. Strike 
it . 

T'CHALLA 
Anywhere? 

SHUR! 
Mhm. 

T'Challa 
turns 
to the mannequin 
in a relaxed 
fighting 
stance
. 

Shuri 
nods and T' Challa 
SPIN KICKS the 
shit 
out of the 
mannequin! 

SHUR! (CONT'D) 
Not that 
hard, 
genius! 

T'CHALLA 
You told 
me to strike 
it, 
you 

didn't 
say how hard . 

Shuri 
picks 
the mannequin 
back up and drags 
it 
over to the 
same spot . 

SHUR! 
I invite 
you to my lab, 
and you 
just 
kick 
things 
around . 


T'CHALLA 

Well maybe you should 
make it 
a 
little 
stronger
, eh? 

37 . 

Shuri 
shrugs 
as we see Wakandan Script 
built 
into 
the 
suit 
GLOWING INDIGO where the 
impact 
of T'Challa's 
foot 
landed. 

T'Challa 
looks 
closely 
at the glowing 
script
. 

T'CHALLA (CONT'D) 

Wait a minute . 

SHURI 

The nanites 
absorb 
the kinetic 

energy 
and hold it 
in place 
for 
redistribu
t ion . 

T'CHALLA 
Very nice. 

SHURI 

Now strike 
it 
again , in the same 
spot . 

T'Challa 
backs 
up for 
a kick. 
Shuri 
presses 
record 
on her 
Kimoyo . T'Challa 
sees 
this 
and looks 
at her suspiciously
. 

T'CHALLA 

You are recording? 

SHUR! 
For research 
purposes 
. .. 

T'Challa 
loads 
up then 
BOOM! He kicks 
the indigo 
spot 
and 
goes flying 
back across 
the room , CRASHING INTO A TABLE full 
of Shuri's 
gadgets
. Shuri 
cracks 
up.

An elegant 
waitress 
carries 
a tray 
of drinks 
to a CRAPS TABLE 
where we find 
T'Challa
. 

The woman places 
the drinks 
down as T'Challa 
peers 
across 
the 
gambling 
pit 
at someone he recognizes 
and starts 
that 
way. 

T'CHALLA 
(into 
comm) 
Six. 
Just 
spotted 
an old friend 
who 

works for 
the CIA. It 
just 
got a 
little 
more complicated. 

T'Challa 
steps 
up to another 
crowded CRAPS TABLE next 
to 
EVERETT ROSS, the sixth 
CIA agent 
he spotted
. 

T'CHALLA (CONT'D) 
Agent Ross . 

ROSS 

Your highness
. 

Ross plays 
it 
cool . 

T'CHALLA 

You are buying 
from Klaue ... 

ROSS 
What I'm doing 
or not doing 
on 
behalf 
of the US government 
is of 
none of your concern. 
Now, whatever 
the hell 
you're 
up to , do me a 
favor 
and stay 
out of my way. 

T'CHALLA 
I gave you Zemo. 


ROSS 
And didn't 
I kept 
it 
under wraps 
that 
the King of a third 
world 

country 
runs 
around 
in a 
bulletproof 
cat 
suit. 
I ' d say we 

were even . 

41 . 

Ross places 
a Pass bet. 
T'Challa 
dumps a stack 
of chips 
on 
Don't 
Pass. 
All of the 
SHOOTER'S FRIENDS blow on the 
dice. 

ROSS (CONT'D) 
You really 
need to leave, 
now. 

They watch the dice 
roll
. They land on 3. The dea l er takes 
away Ross' 
bet , and slides 
T'Challa's 
massive 
payout 
over to 
him . 

T' CHALLA 

Klaue is leaving 
out that 
door with 
me. You've 
been warned. 

T'Challa 
walks 
toward 
another 
craps 
table
, leaving 
the pile 
of chips 
behind 
(money means nothing 
to him) . 

ROSS 
(to the empty chair) 

Hey, you won. 

Ross scratches 
his brow as a THIRSTY GAMBLER (Stan 
Lee) who 

was sitting 
next to T'Challa 
grabs 
them . 

Ross eyes the 
Thirsty 
Gambler who shrugs
. 

THIRSTY GAMBLER 

You know what, 
I think 
I'll 
just 
take 
these
, bring 
'em over here 
and 
hold on for 
safe 
keeping
. 

He slides 
them all 
onto the DON'T PASS bet 
and Ross walks 
off 
in search 
of T'Challa
. 

ROSS 
(into 
comm) 
Ok heads up , the King of Wakanda is 
here . He cannot 
leave 
with 
Klaue . 

T'Challa 
stands 
at a ROULETTE TABLE when Ross walks 
up to 
him. 


ROSS (CONT'D) 
Alright
, vibranium 
from the 
attack 
on Sokovia 
links 
back to a person 
that 
I'm not actually 
saying 
I'm 
here to make a deal 
with 
but that 
deal 
will 
not be called 
off. 
When 
the dust 
settles 
you and I can work 
something 
out . 

T'CHALLA 
I am not here to make a deal . 

Ross rolls 
his 
eyes . 

EXT. JAGALCHI FISH MARKET - NIGHT

SEVERAL BLACK 4RUNNERS pull 
up in f r ont of the Korean 
Woman 
and a platoon 
of EIGHT SOUTH AFRICAN TOUGHS dressed

hop out of the trucks 
protecting 
Klaue. 
Klaue winks at the 
Korean Woman as he wal ks past 
her. 
She smi l es back and nods 
to the TOUGH behind 
her . 

INT. ANTEROOM

ON ROSS AND T'CHALLA 

At a stalemate. 
Then .. . 

NAKIA (O. S. ) 
Klaue plus 
8 ! 

Ross looks 
to the 
entrance 
and immediately 
moves away from 
T'Challa
. 

T'Challa 
watches 
Ross approach 
a third 
CRAPS TABLE. T'C halla 
turns 
his back to avoid 
being 
seen . 

T' CHALLA

Who changes

from the bar to the CRAPS TABLE where 
T'Challa 
was initially 
standing

NAKIA 
I don't

ON OKOYE 

As TWO OF KLAUE' S TOUGHS post 
up on either

cool 
as they 
look around 
at the

ON KLAUE 

OKOYE

allo wed in here . 

NAKIA (O. S. ) 
There's

OKOYE 
Someone did not get the memo. 
Definitely 
armed . 

Klaue spots 
Ross and smiles 
as he heads 
down the stairs 
flanked 
by a couple 
of his 
TOUGHS. 

INT. FIRST FLOOR, CRAPS TABLE - NIGHT 

Ross keeps 
his cool 
as Kl aue approaches
. 

ROSS 
Well that 
is quite 
the entourage
. 

You got a mixtape 
coming out? 

Klaue cuts 
Ross a look . 

KLAUE 
Yeah ! Yeah , actually 
there 
is one . 

Shocked , Ross is unsure 
if 
Kl aue is serious
. 


KLAUE (CONT'D) 
Yea I'll 
send you the 
soundcloud 
link 
if you like
. 

Klaue turns 
to one of his 
goons . 

KLAUE (CONT'D) 

Aye, Dave . Get him the 
link 
to the 
tape . 

The SOUTH AFRICAN TOUGH reaches 
into 
his 
pocket 
for his 
phone. 

ROSS 
Please 
don't 
make me listen 
to your 
music . I just 
meant , you got a lot 
of people 
with yo u. 

KLAUE 

Oh, you think 
they're 
for you? 

Klaue laughs 
at this
. 

KLAUE (CONT'D) 
Don't 
worry . I can do a deal 
with 
you all 
by myself
, thank 
you very 

much . 

44. 

He rubs 
Ross on the 
shoulder
, hard , and for way too long . As 

several 
more SOUTH AFRICAN TOUGHS come pouring 
out of the VIP 

lounges
. 

NAKIA (O. S . ) 

Six more, 
it ' s a set 
up. 

KLAUE 
You got the diamonds? 

Klaue is still 
rubbing 
Ross' 
shoulder
. 

ROSS 
Ok, that's 
enough. 

A CIA AGENT walks 
a FANCY SLIM BRIEFCASE towards 
Ross. 

ON NAKIA 

NAKIA 
We need to move on Klaue. 

ON T'CHALLA 


T'CHALLA 
Stand down . We can't

out. 

BACK IN THE PIT 

45. 

Ross eyes Klaue as the CIA agent 
brings 
him the briefcase
. 

ROSS 
The vibranium? 

Klaue looks 
around , and reaches 
into 
his 
pants 
and pulls 
out 
a wrinkled, 
sweaty 
paper 
bag, 
with 
"FRAGILE" written 
on it 
with a sharpie
. Ross looks 
at the bag. 

ON NAKIA 

KLAUE 

I was going to buy a fancy 
suitcase, 
but I thought 
I'd 
save 
myself 
some money . 

NAKIA 
It's 
now or never . 

Nakia continues 
towards 
the CIA agent. 

ON OKOYE 

OKOYE 
(in Xhosa) 

STAND DOWN! 

A South African 
Tough hears 
her, 
and turns 
towards 
her. 

ON OKOYE 

SOUTH AFRICAN TOUGH 
Hey. 

Okoye pretends 
she doesn't 
hear 
him. 

SOUTH AFRICAN TOUGH (CONT'D) 
Hey! 

OKOYE 
(into 
comms) 
(in Xhosa) 
I've 
been made. 


46 . 

Okoye starts 
for the 
stairs 
when ANOTHER TOUGH moves to cut 

her off . Okoye slows down and the TOUGH trailing 
behind 
her 
reaches 
out to grab her hand and turn 
her around . 

As soon as the goon touches 
Okoye , she TWISTS him into 
an ARM-

BAR, throws 
her purse 
at the OTHER TOUGH and extends 
her 

spear , stabbing 
the OTHER TOUGH in the foot . She then throws 

her WIG into 
the ARM BAR TOUGH's face, 
and hurls 
him over the 
railing
. 

DOWNSTAIRS 

The arm-bar 
tough 
CRASHES DOWN onto a gaming table 
behind 

Klaue and startled 
patrons
, scramble 
in every 
direction
. 

Klaue spins 
toward 
the commotion as ... 

Klaue looks 
back to Ross and spots 
T'Challa. 

Producing 
a HANDGUN from his waist, 
Klaue opens fire 
on Ross 

and the CIA agent . Ross uses 
the 
SLIM SUITCASE as a shield 
as 

he ducks down below the craps 
table 
and . . . 

T'Challa 
leaps 
to action
, KICKING and FLIPPING THE TABLE on 
its 
edge to block 
GUNFIRE from Klaue's 
other 
toughs. 

With bullets 
flying 
everywhere 
... 
PANICKED PEOPLE run for 
their 
lives
. It's 
CHAOS. 

Surrounded 
by TOUGHS, Klaue retreats 
for the 
stairs
. 

KLAUE 
Get the diamonds, 
quick ! 

EVERY ONE OF KLAUE'S TOUGHS unload, 
raining 
shells 
on the 
overturned 
craps 
table 
with Ross and T'Challa 
behind 
it . 

The TOUGHS move in only to have T'Challa 
leap 
from the table
, 

staying 
low to FOOTSWEEP one onto his 
back . T'Challa 
kicks 
him back then disarms 
another 
TOUGH and kicks 
him into 
the 

bar . T'Challa 
then 
spins 
and kicks 
the next TOUGH over the 
roulette 
table 
and through 
the bar railing. 

Nakia grabs 
a goon in an ARM TWIST trying 
to relieve 
him of 

his gun . She takes 
off 
one shoe and knocks 
out another 
approaching 
gun. 
Swings the 
arm twisted 
goon to the 
floor, 
knocks 
him out, 
taking 
his 
gun and shooting 
up towards 
the 
balcony 
where Okoye is fighting
. 

ON OKOYE 

Okoye BATTLES TWO TOUGHS with her full-length 
spear, 
dropping 
both with proficiency
. 


She kicks 
the 
gun away from one, 
fights 
another 
with 
her 
spear, 
then 
kicks 
a TOUGH over the 
rail. 

47 . 

Okoye JUMPS down to the casino 
floor 
and stabs 
a goon on her 
way down, tucks 
and rolls. 

Okoye takes 
out a TOUGH with 
her spear. 
Nakia flips 
a TOUGH 
over her back . 
T'Challa 
sends 
a TOUGH and table 
flying
. 

Beats 
down two more TOUGHS, he turns 
for more. 

T'Challa 
spots 
Klaue nearing 
the 
entrance 
and breaking 
away 
from the 
fight, 
LEAPS HALF WAY UP onto a column , bounds off 
to the UPPER BALCONY 

INT. UNDERGROUND 
CASINO, BALCONY - NIGHT 

T'Challa 
lands 
10 feet 
behind 
Klaue. 

T'CHALLA 
(in Xhosa) 

Murderer! 

Klaue stops 
and turns 
around 
to face 
T'Challa. 
He tries 
to 
fire 
his 
gun but discovers 
he ' s out of ammo. 

Klaue smiles, 
dropping 
his 
gun and puts 
his 
hands up --
as 
KLAUE'S PROSTHETIC LEFT ARM suddenly 
splits 
open, 
revealing 
itself 
to be a SONIC DISRUPTER! 

KLAUE 
You know, you look 
just 
like 
your 
old man. 

T'Challa 
snatches 
up a ROLLING CHANGE CART TABLE just 
as 

Klaue fires 
the blaster 
at him . 

BOOOOM
!! ! A COLOSSAL SONIC BLAST hits 
the cart, 
blowing 
it 
to 
pieces 
and sending 
T'Challa 
FLYING THROUGH THE UPPER BALCONY 

RAILING back down into 
the pit
. With money FLOATING in the 
air , T'Challa 
lands 
hard . 

KLAUE (CONT'D) 
I made it 
rain! 

ON NAKIA AND OKOYE 

Nakia and Okoye make their 
way to the top of the stairs

Klaue jumps in the 
first

instantly 
skids 
away as ... 

Nakia and Okoye emerge . Okoye throws 
an EMP bead from her 
pocket 
and it 
lands 
on a parked 
LEXUS LC. 

NAKIA 
Do we just 
leave 
him? 

OKOYE 

He'll

could

it 
in South

was in Africa

it . The

ABANDONED 
AIRFIELD/GARAGE, SOUTH KOREA - EVENING 

An airplane 
graveyard
. The paint 
truck 
pulls 
to a stop 
on the 
airstrip
. Killmonger, 
Klaue , Limbani 
and Linda hop out, 
and 
hump their 
gear to a FOUR- SEATER ESCAPE PLANE parked 
on the 
airstrip
. 

LIMBANI 
Let's 
get going, 
boss. 

KILLMONGER 
You always 
sell 
to the CIA? 

KLAUE 
I sell 
to the highest 
bidder
. Don' t 
you worry when I get back to Jo-
burg and lay low for 
a bit, 
I ' ll 
make sure 
both you guys get paid. 

KILLMONGER 
Oh I ain't 
worried 
about 
the money, 
bro . I know you're 
good for 
it . 

Klaue smiles. 

KILLMONGER (CONT'D) 
On our way back, 
just 
drop us of in 
Wakanda. 

KLAUE 
You don't 
wanna go there, 
boy . 

KILLMONGER 
Yea I do . 

Killmonger 
suddenly 
draws a HANDGUN 
and SHOOTS LIMBANI DEAD. 

Reacting 
to the shot , Klaue crowds Linda with 
a skilled 
GRAPPLING MOVE and snatches 
her gun away before 
she can fire 
on him . 

Killmonger 
finds 
Klaue holding 
Linda's 
gun to her head, 
using 
her as his 
shield
. 

KLAUE 
(stumped) 
Drop it, 
or your little 
Bonnie and 
Clyde routine 
ends today . Put your 
gun down now! 

LINDA 
I'm sorry
. I'm sorry
, Erik . 


KILLMONGER 

It's 
gonna be ok . 

Killmonger 
fires 
without 
hesitation
. The BULLET TRAVELS 

THROUGH Linda , ki lli
ng her while 
Klaue dives 
behind 
the 

plane , WOUNDED 
IN THE SHOULDER from the 
round . 

69. 

Killmonger 
moves to finish 
Klaue but he's 
gone . Following 
Klaue's 
blood 
trail
, Killmonger 
STALKS Klaue through 
the 

SCRAPYARD. 

Klaue fires 
at Killmonger
, missing
. Killmonger 
stops 
and 
turns, 
ducking 
between 
planes. 
Killmonger 
spots 
Klaue THROUGH 
THE GLASS of a cockpit 
window and FIRES . 

Sniped 
through 
the window with precision
, Klaue falls
, losing 
Linda's 
gun . Ki l lmonger 
approaches 
and Klaue rolls 
to his 
back to face 
him . 

KLAUE 

... Y-You really 
wanna go to 

Wakanda? They're 
savages. 

Klaue shows his 
BRANDED neck . 

KLAUE (CONT'D) 
This is what they 
do to people 
like 
us. 

KILLMON 
GER 
I ain't 
worried 
about 
no brand . 

Check these 
out. 

Killmonger 
rolls 
up his 
sleeve
, uncovering 
SEVERAL AFRICAN 
SCARIFICATION MARKS on his forearm
. 

KILLMONGER (CONT'D) 

Each one is for 
a kill
. 

KLAUE 
You can sca r yourself 
as much as 

you like
. To them , you'll 
just 
be 

an outsider. 
You're 
crazy 
to think 
that 
you could 
walk in there
. 

Killmonger 
flips 
the 
inside 
of his bottom 
lip, 
revealing 
a 

glowing 
Wakandan TATTOO. 

Klaue can't 
believe 
his 
eyes . 

KLAUE (CONT'D) 
And to think 
I saw you as some 

crazy 
American
. 


70. 

Klaue starts 
laughing, 
hard . 

Killmonger 
aims and pulls 
the trigger 
at point 
blank 
range. 

INT. HALL OF KINGS, CITY OF THE DEAD - NIGHT 

T'Challa 
enters 
to find 
Zuri tending 
to the garden. 
He looks 
around 
to the other 
Shamans. 

T' CHALLA 
Leave us. 

They immediately 
head out . zuri 
turns 
to T'Challa
. 

ZURI 
So your mission 
did not go as 
planned
. 

T'CHALLA 
What happened 
to my Uncle N'Jobu? 
My father 
told 
me he disappeared 
... 

there 
was a man today 
wearing 
a 
ring 
identical 
to this 
one . 

Zuri turns 
back and T'Challa 
lifts 
his 
hand, 
showing his 
VIBRANIUM RING from CA:CW. 

zuri 
turns 
away uncomfortable. 

ZURI 
That is not possible
. 

T' CHALLA 
He helped 
Klaue escape 
from us and 
he was wearing 
this 
ring . My 
grandfather
' s ring . Do not tell 
me 
what is possible 
tell 
me the truth
. 

ZURI 
Some truths 
are too much to bear , 

T'Challa. 

T'CHALLA 
That is not your choice 
to make. 
What happened 
to him? 

ZURI 
I promised 
the King to say nothing
. 

T'CHALLA 
I am your King now! 

Zuri 
looks 
up. 


ZURI 
Your uncle 
took a War Dog 
assignment 
in America . Your father 
placed 
me there 
to observe 
unbeknownst 
to him. Your uncle 
fell 
in love with 
an American 
woman. 

They had a child
. The hardships 
he 
saw there 
radicalized 
your uncle. 

INT. N'JOBU'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 

71. 

N'JOBU makes his 
plea 
to YOUNG T'CHAKA, picking 
up where we 
left 
off 
in the Oakland 
sequence
. 

N'JOBU 

I observed 
for 
as long as I could ! 

Their 
leaders 
have been 

assassinated
, communities 
flooded 

with drugs 
and weapons , they 
are 
overly 
policed 
and incarcerated. 

All over the planet 
our people 
suffer 
because 
they 
don't 
have the 
tools 
to fight 
back. 
With vibranium 

weapons they 
could 
overthrow 
every 
country 
and Wakanda could 
rule 
them 
all , the right 
way . . . 

INT. HALL OF KINGS, CITY OF THE DEAD - NIGHT 

ZURI 
He knew your father 
would not 
support 
this
, so your uncle 
betrayed 
us. 

T'CHALLA 
No . •. 

ZURI 

He helped 
Klaue steal 
the 
vibranium
. 

T'CHALLA 
No no no no no no . . . 

INT. N'JOBU'S APARTMENT - NIGHT - FLASHBACK 

Young T'Chaka 
turns 
to N'Jobu. 


YOUNG T'CHAKA 

You will 
return 
home at once , where 
you will 
face 
the council 
and 
inform 
them of your crimes
. 

72. 

N'Jobu 
reaches 
into 
his waistband 
and pulls 
a HANDGUN, aiming 
it 
at James/Young 
Zuri's 
head, 
freezing 
him . 

ZURI (0. S. ) 
He drew his 
weapon on me 

Young T'Chaka 
pops his 
claws . He quickly 
springs 
forward
, 

digging 
his 
CLAWS into 
the 
slide 
and destroying 
it , before 
he 
can pull 
the trigger
. He then 
buries 
his 
CLAWS into 
N'Jobu's 
chest
, killing 
him instantly
. He lets 
N'Jobu's 
body drop to 

the floor, 
and closes 
his 
eyes. 

ZURI (CONT'D) 
Your father 
killed 
his 
own 
brother

welling 
up in

Speak nothing 
of this

One of the young kids

ZURI 

We had to maintain 
the 
lie . 

73. 

Gutted , T'Challa 
can't 
reconcile 
what he's 
just 
heard . He 

turns 
his back on Zuri . 

EXT. WAKANDAN 
BORDER REGION, MOUNTAIN PLAINS - MORNING 

Dragging 
a LARGE BAG, Killmonger 
approaches
. In the distance
, 

we see the 
four-seater 
plane . 

W'Kabi approaches 
as Killmonger 
drops 
the bag . 

W'KABI 

What is this? 

KILLMONGER 
Just 
a 'lil 
gift
. 

Killmonger 
opens his 
bag , revealing 
KLAUE'S CORPSE. W'Kabi's 
eyes widen, 
and his men draw their 
swords . 

W'KABI (SUBTITLE) 
(Xhosa) 
Who are 
you? 

INT. SHURI'S LAB, WAKANDA 
DESIGN GROUP - MORNING 

Ross suddenly 
opens his 
eyes and reaches 
for his 
gunshot 

wound finding 
it 
astonishingly 
almost 
fully 
healed. 

Shuri 
tinkers 
with 
the 
circuitry 
of a PAIR OF MASSIVE CLAWED 
VIBRANIUM GAUNTLETS across 
the room as Ross sits 
up. 

ROSS 

Alright, 
where am I? 

Startled, 
Shuri 
spins
. 

SHURI 
Don't 
scare 
me like 
that, 
colonizer
. 

ROSS 
Colon-who? 
My name is Everett
. 

SHURI 
Yes , I know . Everett 
Ross former 
airforce 
pilot 
and now, CIA. 


ROSS 
Right. 

Groggy, 
Ross gazes 
around 
at the completely 
unique 
technology
. 

ROSS (CONT'D) 
Ok, is this 
Wakanda? 

SHUR! 
(still 
working) 
No, it ' s Kansas . 

ROSS 

... How long ago was Korea? 

SHUR! 
Yesterday
. 

ROSS 
I don't 
think 
so . Bullet 
wounds 
don't 
just 
magically 
heal 
overnight. 

SHUR! 

They do here. 
But not by magic , by 
technology. 
(beat) 
Don't 
touch 
anything
. My brother 
will 
return 
soon. 

74 . 

Leery, 
Shuri 
watches 
Ross wander 
about 
out of the corner 
of 

her eye . He walks 
over to the observation 
deck and gazes 
in 
awe at the exposed 
GLOWING ROCKS inside 
of the VIBRANIUM 

MINE. 

Suddenly 
an AUTOMATED 
MINING CART whips between 
light 
panels, 

floating 
above a rail
. 

ROSS 
These train 
things 
... that's 

magnetic 
levitation, 
right? 

SHUR! 
Obviously. 

ROSS 
Obviously ... but I've 
never 
seen it 
this 
efficient
. The light 
panels, 

what are they? 

SHUR! 
Sonic 
stabilizers
. 


ROSS 
Sonic what? 

SHUR! 
In it's 
raw form , vibranium 
is too 

dangerous 
to be transported 
at that 
speed , so I developed 
a way to 
temporarily 
deactivate 
it. 

ROSS 
(in disbelief) 
There's 
vibranium 
on those 
trains? 

SHURI 

There is vibranium 
all 
around 
us. 
That's 
how I healed 
you. 

Ross tries 
to process 
this 
as a 3D PROJECTION OF OKOYE 
unexpectedly 
forms. 

OKOYE'$ PROJECTION 

Where is T'Challa? 
His Kimoyo beads 

have been switched 
off . 

Ross, 
amazed , tries 
to touch 
the 
sand projection
. 

SHUR! 
Well we are not joined 
at the hip , 

Okoye . 

OKOYE'$ PROJECTION 
A man showed up at the border 
who 

claims 
to have killed 
Klaue. 

SHUR! 

What? 

OKOYE'$ PROJECTION 
W'Kabi is transporting 
him as we 

speak to the pa l ace. 
We need to 

find 
your brother
. 

SHUR! 
An outsider? 

OKOYE'$ PROJECTION 

No, a Wakandan . 

75 . 

An IMAGE OF KILLMONGER from the border 
appears 
on Shuri's 

monitor
. 

Then . . . Ross slowly 
walks 
into 
sight, 
staring 
at the screen
. 


ROSS 
He's not a Wakandan . He's one of 
ours. 

EXT. WAKANDAN 
COUNTRYSIDE - MORNING 

T'Challa 
and Nakia gaze out off the 
side 
of a beautiful 
overlook
. 

T' CHALLA 
He killed 
his 
own brother 
... 
and 
left 
a child 
behind 
with nothing
. 

What kind of King • . . what kind of 
man does that? 

NAKIA 
No man is perfect
. Not even your 
father. 

T'CHALLA 
He didn ' t even give 
him a proper 
burial 
... 
My Uncle N'Jobu 
betrayed 
us , but my father 
may have created 
something 
even worse . 

NAKIA 
Hey. Look at me. You can't 
let 
your 
father
' s mistakes 
define 
who you 
are . You get to decide 
what kind of 
King you are going 
to be. 

They share 
a look as T'C hal la's 
Kimoyo beads 
buzz . 

SHURI'S PROJECTION 
Brother
, you need to get here 
now. 

T' Chall a and Nakia look at each othe r.

T'Cha l la , Shuri

as Ross briefs 
them on 
Killmonger. 
A BODY SCAN IMAGE of Killmonger 
is on Shuri's 
monitor. 

ROSS 
Eric 
Stevens
. Graduated 
Annapolis 
age 19 . MIT for 
grad school
. Joined 
the SEALs and went to Afghanistan 
where he racked 
up confirmed 
kills 
like 
it was a video 
game . They 
started 
calling 
him Killmonger
. He 
joined 
a JSOC ghost 
unit
. 

(MORE) 


ROSS (CONT' D) 
Now these 
guys are serious
. They 
will 
drop off 
the grid 
so they 
can 
commit assassinations 
and take 
down 
governments
. 

T'CHALLA 
Did he reveal 
anything 
about 
his 
identity? 

SHURI 
He has a War Dog tattoo 
but we have 
no record 
of him . 

T' Challa 
and Shuri 
share 
a look . 

INT. TRIBAL COUNCIL ROOM - DAY 

77 . 

T'Challa 
sits 
on his 
throne 
surrounded 
by the Tribal 
Elders
, 

Ramonda , Shuri , Okoye , and the Dora . 

RIVER TRIBE ELDER 
Is this 
man Wakandan or not? 

MINING TRIBE ELDER 
(in Xhosa) 
Tell 
us what is going 
on . 

Killmonger 
is escorted 
in by W'Kabi . 

W'Kabi 
tensely 
steps 
next 
to T'Challa 
as Killmonger 
takes 
his 
place 
before 
the circle. 

T'CHALLA 
(in Xhosa) 
Speak. 

W' KABI 
(translates 
for 
Killmonger) 
Speak . 

KILLMON 
GER 
I'm standing 
in your house . Serving 
justice 
to a man who stole 
your 
vibranium 
and murdered 
your people
. 

Justice 
your King couldn't 
deliver. 

T'Challa 
walks 
close 
enough to Killmonger 
to be able 
to 
whisper 
to him . 


T'CHALLA 
I don't 
care 
that 
you brought 

Klaue, 
the only 
reason 
I don't 
kill 

you where you stand 
is because 
I 

know who you are ... now what do you 
want? 

KILLMON 
GER 
I want the throne
. 

78 . 

The entire 
room scoffs 
at this
. Some ELDERS even hold their 
heads 
back and laugh . 

MINING TRIBE ELDER 
(in Xhosa) 
My goodness. 

KILLMONGER 
Y'all 
sittin' 
up here 
comfortable. 

Must feel 
good . There's 
about 
2 
billion 
people 
all 
over the world 

that 
looks 
like 
us but their 
lives 

are a lot 
harder
, Wakanda has the 
tools 
to liberate 
them all
. 

T'CHALLA 
And what tools 
are those? 

KILLMONGER 
Vibranium
. Your weapons. 

T'CHALLA 
Our our weapons will 
not be used to 
wage war on the world . It 
is not 

our way to be judge 
jury 
and 

executioner 
for 
people 
who are not 
our own. 

KILLMONGER 
Not your own? But didn't 
life 
start 
here , on this 
continent? 
So ain ' t 
all 
people 
your people? 

T'CHALLA 

I am not King of all 
people. 
I am 

King of Wakanda. 
And it 
is my 
responsibility 
to make sure 
our 

people 
are safe 
and that 
vibranium 

does not fall 
into 
the hands 
of a 
person 
like 
you. 

The elders 
murmur at Killmonger's 
disrespect. 
They wait 
to 
see how T'Challa 
will 
respond
. Then , Ramonda suddenly 
speaks
. 


RAMONDA 

Son , we have entertained 
this 
charlatan 
for 
too long. 
Reject 
his 
request

Killmonger 
eyes the Elders 
with 
an amused grin . 

KILLMON

Oh, I ain't 
requesting 
nothing
! 

Ask who I am? 

SHURI 
You are Eric 
Stevens. 
An American 
black 
operative
. A mercenary 
nicknamed 
Killmonger. 
That's 
who 
you are . 

KILLMONGER 

(laughing) 
That's 
not my name , Princess

me, King? 

T'CHALLA 

No. 

KILLMON

Ask me. 

T'CHALLA 
Take him away. 

RIVER TRIBE ELDER

Who are you? 

KILLMONGER 

(Xhosa) 

I am N'Jadaka, 
son of Prince 

N'Jobu . 

79 . 

A hush fa l ls over the room . The tribal 
elders 
knew N'Jobu . 

This changes 
EVERYTHING. 

MINING TRIBE ELDER 

(in Xhosa) 
The son of N'Jobu? 

KILLMONGER 
I found my daddy with 
Panther 
claws 
in his

RAMONDA 

He has no rights

The challenge 
would take 
weeks to 

prepare

KILLMONGER 
Weeks? I don't 
need weeks. 
The

ain't 
gotta 
be there 
I just 
need him ... 
and somebody 
to 
get me out of these 
chains. 

RAMONDA

his 
foot 
and holds 
a SWORD to go with

are entirely 
empty . 

ON SHURI AND RAMONDA 

SHURI 
He will

Ramonda looks 
concerned

Zuri brings 
T'Challa 
the 
DEATH HERB and he repeats 
the 
process
, poisoning 
T'Challa 
while 
Killmonger 
stares 
on 
silently
. 

ZURI 
The King will 
now have the strength 
of the Black Pa nther 
stripped 
away . 

Staring 
T'Challa 
down, Killmonger 
suddenly 
turns 
to Zuri . 

They recognize 
each other. 
Zuri 
looks 
away ashamed. 

IN THE SEATING AREA 

Nakia arrives 
through 
a tunnel 
and wal ks up to Okoye , who 
turns 
to her . 

OKOYE 
Where is Agent Ross?

He takes 
off

at his

revealing 
the 
SCARIFICATION MARKS that 
go up his

DOWN but hesitates 
with 
his 
sword and doesn't 
strike 
as they 
roll 
toward 
the edge of the waterfall

Back on their

circle
, and Killmonger 
lunges 
at 
T'Challa 
who dodges. 
T'Challa 
manages to knock Killmonger 
off 
his

the advantage

Yield ! 

Killrnonger 
FEROCIOUSLY BOBS INSIDE , but T'Challa 
lunges 
at 
Killrnonger, 
giving 
him a superficial 
SLASH ACROSS his

Hurt , T'Challa 
realizes 
his 
compassion 
was a mistake 
and he 

must fight 
back but blood 
leaks 
from his 
side. 

Killmonger 
dodges 
T'Challa

Stumbling

is unable 
to avoid

The elders 
gasp as Ramonda looks

Killmonger 
skewers 
Zuri with 
his

Killmonger 
drives 
the spear 
in further 
and GRABBING THE BLADE 
with both hands 
in death, 
Zuri 
falls

After 
a moment, the door opens 
and Okoye quickly 
wipes 
her 
eyes . Pulling 
it 
together
, she stands 
as Nakia approaches. 

The two women silently 
take 
each other 
in , sharing 
in their 
sorrow . 

OKOYE

Nakia nods .

OKOYE 
He is of royal

He killed 
T' Challa

In ritual

Okoye quiets

NAKIA (CONT'D) 
You are the greatest 
warrior 
Wakanda has . Help me overthrow 
him 
before 
he becomes 
too strong
. 

Okoye stares 
at Nakia 
in disbelief. 

OKOYE 
Overthrow?
! Nakia , I am not a spy 
who can come and go as they 
so 

choose. 
I am loyal 
to the 
throne, 

no matter 
who sits 
upon it . What 

are you loyal 
to? 

NAKIA 

I loved 
him. 
I love my country

holding 
several

something 
is wrong. 

ROSS 
What's 
wrong? 

Nakia tosses 
the blanket

Ross emerge from the

the 
place 
where his 
father 
died . He walks 
over to the WALL HIDE 
and digs 
out a METAL STASH BOX. 

He breaks 
open the box and inside 
finds 
N'JOBU'S JOURNAL, 
cash and a pistol. 

Opening the diary, 
he finds 
details 
of Wakandan history 
and 
life, 
including 
drawings
. He finds 
his 
father's 
RING on a 
necklace

it

Then , Killmonger

YOUNG KILLMONGER 
Your home .

Yes. The sunsets 
there

Well look at what I have done. 
I 
should 
have taken 
you back long 
ago .

Young Killmonger

Killmonger, 

who sheds 
a tear

N'JOBU (CONT'D) 
Instead,

abandoned 

here. 

KILLMONGER 

Well maybe your home is the one

So 

we're

Ramonda stops

Yes, but . . .

Killmonger

of the Heart 
Shaped Herb. 

ROSS 

Of course 
he did . 

The T'Challa 
turns 
to Ross . 

ROSS (CONT'D)

Please

M'BAKU 
No harm wi l l come to her I give you

an enemy sits

a massive 
sonic 
blow that 
sends 
them flying 
as well 
as 
lifting 
some of the 
spilled 
spears 
into 
the air. 

Panther 
grabs 
a spear 
and with 
expert 
precision 
throws 
it 
at

explodes 
on impact, 
sending 
the 
DRAGONFLYER 
careening 
towards

right 
at them . 

Both fighters 
evade the train 
at the 
last 
second 
as the train 
whips past , creating 
a barrier 
between 
them too big to jump 
over. 

T'Challa 
stands 
up as his 
suit 
partially 
retracts 
into 
his 
necklace 
leaving 
his 
skin 
exposed . 

Killmonger
, on the other 
side 
of the train
, looks 
at his 
malfunctioning 
suit 
in confusion
. He turns 
and looks 
back at 
the stabilizer
. 

KILLMON 
GER 
I don't 
need a suit 
to kill 
you . 

They look at each other 
from across 
the blinding 
fast 
train
. 

KILLMONGER 
(CONT'D) 
Your reign 
is over. 
You sat 
up here 
safe 
and protected. 

T'CHALLA 
You want to see us become just 
like 
the people 
you hate 
so much? Divide 
and conquer 
the land 
as they 
did? 

KILLMON 
GER 
No I learn 
from my enemies 
--
beat 
them at their 
own game . 

T'CHALLA 
You have become them . You will 
destroy 
the world, 
Wakanda 
included
. 

KILLMONGER 
The world took 
away everything 
away 
from me! Everything 
I ever 
loved ! 

But I'm gonna make sure we're 
even.

KILLMONGER (CONT'D) 
I'm gonna track 
down anyone who 
would even think 
about 
being 
loyal 
to you , and I'm gonna put they 
ass 

in the dirt
, right 
next to Zuri. 

111. 

Hatred 
flashes 
over T'Challa's 
eyes 
as he reengages 
his mask 
and the train 
clears. 
Killmonger 
engages 
his mask , and they 
leap 
at each other 
again .

Shuri 
moves to Nakia's

SHURI 

Nakia! 
Are you alright? 

NAKIA 
I'm ok . You? 

SHURI 

Yes . 

NAKIA 

Let's

They join

Okoye and Ayo. 

INT. SHURI'S LAB, COCKPIT - DAY 

Ross begins 
maneuvering 
the 
controls 
like 
an expert 
pilot. 

He guides 
the 
ship 
through 
a canyon, 
chasing 
the 
remaining 
CARGO SHIP , while 
firing 
at the THREE DRAGONFLYERS 
that 
are 

all 
attempting 
to take 
him down. 

ROSS 
Shuri, 
I've 
lost 
one of them but 
two are on my tail

confused
. 


ROSS 
What the

The lab

ROSS 
What? Where?

Deactivating

112 . 

The display 
in front 
of Ross comes down, revealing 
A MASSIVE 

DRAGONFLYER 
FIRING SONIC BLASTS outside 
of the windows of the 
lab. 

Ross jumps at the 
sight 
of this
. Realizing 
he is now sitting 
in a death 
trap. 

SHURI ( 0. S . ) 
Ross! 
You have to get out of there 
now! 

ROSS 

How long 
have I got? 

GRIOT (O. S . ) 
Glass

Ross looks 
at the window and thinks 
about 
it 
for 
a beat . He 
re-grips 
the pilot 
handles. 

ROSS 

Put me back in. 

SHURI (O.S . ) 
Ross ! Ross? ! 

The ship 
projection 
comes back up , and Ross continues 
to fly. 

EXT. MT. BASHENGA, TOP OF THE HILL - DAY 

As our heroes 
fight
, the 
Border 
Tribesmen 
continue 
to use 
their 
advanced 
shields 
to close 
them off 
into 
an impenetrable 
circle
. 

Okoye looks 
around, 
searching 
for 
an option 
for 
escape 
through 
the 
sea of Border 
Tribesmen
. We find 
W' Kabi in the 
distance 
perched 
atop 
M20 looking 
back at her . 

W'KABI 
Surrender 
now ! You have three 
seconds 
to lay down your weapons !

Okoye looks 
back resolute
. 

W'KABI (CONT'D) 
One ... two . • . 

The sound of an attack 
is heard 
from behind 
W'Kabi . 

LOUD CHANTS seemingly 
come from every 
direction 
as the entire 
perimeter 
of the Border 
Tribe 
is showing 
signs 
of being 
breached. 

Shuri , Okoye , Nakia , and Ayo look around 
confused
, as one of 
the interior 
shield 
holding 
Border 
Tribesmen 
is suddenly 
lifted 
up by his 
collar
, his 
shield 
disappearing 
as a result
. 

We tilt 
up to r evea l M'Baku holding 
him with one hand and SI X 
Jabari 
warriors 
behind 
him . 

M'BAKU 
Witness 
the might 
of the Jabari

M'Baku throws 
the border 
Tribesman 
into 
the 
sonic 
shield 
and 
we go around 
the horn to see the JABARI WARRIORS tearing 
through 
the border 
tribe 
perimeter 
with their 
wooden weapons. 

M'Baku , seeing 
the breaks 
in the 
interior 
shield 
calls 
for 
his troops 
to move forward
. 

M'BAKU (CONT'D) 
Abya ! ! ! ! 

He jumps down from the 
rock followed 
by his troops
. Okoye 
sees 
this 
and calls 
her troops 
forward. 

OKOYE 
Phambili 
! ! ! ! 

Okoye leads 
the women forward 
through 
the gaps in the 
shield. 

M' Baku breaks 
through
, swinging 
his 
knobkerrie 
to change 
the 
tide 
of the battle. 

M'BAKU 
Abya ! ! ! 

INT. VIBRANIUM MINE BOTTOM - DAY 

Killmonger 
and Panther 
continue 
to brawl . Killmonger 
lands 
a 
deadly 
headbutt 
and an oncoming train 
knocks 
them both to 
opposite 
sides 
of the track. 
As the train 
passes
, Killmonger 
picks 
up the knife 
that 
fell 
into 
the mines along 
with 
them ...

The RTF does battle 
with the DRAGONFLYERS, using 
the sonic 
blasters 
to shoot 
down two of them, 
but taking 
significant 
damage . Ross has a clear 
line 
of sight 
to the 
last

The two remaining

into 
the hobbled 
RTF, slowing 
it 
down and allowing 
the Talon 
Fighter 
to pull 
away . The drills 
send an electronic

Confused , Ross crosses 
his 
fists 
in front 
of him. 

GRIOT (O. S. ) 
Sonic overload 
initiated. 

SHURI (O. S.) 
Now break 
it! 

Ross swings 
his 
arms open. 

EXT. WAKANDAN

The RTF lights 
charge 
up to the max and emit a powerful 

explosion 
of sonic 
energy-
decimating 
the cables 
along 
with 
the dragonflyers 
they 
are attached 
to . 

The RTF lights 
go dead , and the massive 
ship 
begins 
to drop 
out of the sky , falling 
end over end towards 
the ground 
below .

kick 
back into 
full 
capacity, 
causing 
the 
RTF to stop 
on a dime, 
hovering 
12 feet 
from the ground. 
The 
sheer 
force 
from the sonic

cracks 
the ground 
leaving 

a cymatic 
signature

Ross punches 
it-
heading 
straight 
for the 
last 
cargo 
ship . 

EXT. WAKANDAN AIRSPACE -

The cargo 
ship makes it 
over the last 
mountain 
of the 

Wakandan border 
and activates 
the cloaking 
technology. 

The RTF guns in the air 
at a 45 degree 
angle 
and BAM, it 

explodes 
as it 
collides 
with CARGO SHIP , deactivating 
its 

cloaking 
mode , causing 
pieces 
of the RTF and the CARGO SHIP 
to rain 
down over the Wakandan border
.

it . 

ROSS 

Yes ! We did it ! 

SHUR! 
Great!

Ross gets 
up and heads 
towards 
the ramp in the 
lab , as the 
glass 
blows out. 

EXT. MT. BASHENGA

M'Baku , surrounded 
by Border 
Tribesmen 
is held up while 
W'Kabi atop M20 comes charging 
straight 
at him , giving 
him 

nowhere to go , but at the last 
second, 
Okoye steps 
in front 
of M'Baku , staring 
M20 down who gallops 
towards 
her , and 
stops 
at the very last 
second , his 
horn inches 
from Okoye's 
face , M20 licks 
her face 
lovingly
. 


116 . 

W'Kabi dismounts 
and approaches 
Okoye slowly. 
Okoye points 
her spear 
at him. 

OKOYE 
Drop your weapon . 

W'KABI 
Would you kill 
me, my love? 

OKOYE 
For Wakanda? 
(she draws her weapon) 
Without 
question
. 

W'Kabi sees 
the 
fire 
in Okoye's 
eyes . He looks 
around 
at the 
battlefie
l d where the remaining 
Border 
Tribesmen 
are 
surrendering 
to the Jabari 
and Dora . 

W'Kabi looks 
at Okoye for 
long beat, 
then 
throws 
his 
sword 
into 
the dirt 
and kneels 
in front 
of her . 

INT. VIBRANIUM MINE BOTTOM - DAY 

Killmonger 
slashes 
at T' Challa 
with 
the 
spear , backing 
T' Challa 
up towards 
the 
lip 
of the track
. As the train 
comes 
speeding 
towards 
them, 
both their 
suits 
retract
, and T'Challa 
holds 
Killmonger 
off 
as Killmonger 
pushes 
the blade 
of the 
spear 
towards 
his 
face . 

KILLMON 
GER 
This is it 
for you , cousin
. 

T'Challa 
turns 
towards 
the train 
and sees 
that 
it 
is about 
to 
end. 

He lets 
Killmonger 
swing towards 
him and dodges , backing 
up 
even closer 
to the edge of the track, 
and Killmonger 
swings 
again 
- but this 
time T'Challa 
punches 
Killmonger's 
arm , 

jarring 
the blade 
lose 
and sending 
it 
flying 
up into 
the 
air. 

T'Challa 
then 
does a ROLLING ARM BAR TAKEDOWN 
as the BROKEN 
SPEAR flips 
through 
the 
air. 

We track 
with 
the 
spear 
as the SONIC STABILIZATION FIELD 
turns 
off , and the train 
passes 
the two fighters
. As the 
BROKEN SPEAR drops 
T'Challa 
catches 
it with 
his 
right 
hand 
and slams 
it 
into 
Killmonger's 
chest, 
just 
as both their 
suits 
form around 
them . 

Killmonger 
removes 
his 
helmet , then 
looks 
down at the blade 
that 
is buried 
in his chest
. 

T'Challa, 
realizing 
this 
is it , removes 
his mask as well.

Killmonger 
struggles 
to breathe. 

KILLMONGER (CONT'D)

Wakanda was the most

thing 
he'd 
ever 
seen. 
He 
promised

down 
behind 
the horizon. 

KILLMONGER 
It's 
beautiful

T'Challa 
thinks 
for 
a long beat. 

T'CHALLA 

Maybe we can still 
heal 
you . 

Killmonger 
thinks 
on this
. 

KILLMONGER 
Why? So you can just 
lock me up? 
Nah . Just 
bury me in the ocean, 
with my ancestors 
that 
jumped from 
the ships . . . 'cause 
they 
knew death 
was better 
than 
bondage. 

Killmonger 
pulls 
the knife 
out of his 
chest, 
killing 
himself 
instantly. 
T'Challa 
looks 
down at his 
cousin's 
now lifeless 
body and becomes emotional.

and kisses 
him back. 

T'CHALLA (CONT'D) 
Stay . I think 
I know a way you can 
still 
fulfill 
your calling. 
Please 
stay. 

Nakia looks

She kisses 
him . 

EXT. LAKE MERRITT APARTMENT COMPLEX, OAKLAND-DAY 

T'Challa 
and Shuri, 
dressed 
in subtle

now abandoned 
apartment 
building

a group of 
SIX KIDS (mostly 
Black, 
some Latino), 
play 
three 
on a rugged 

basketball

SHURI 
When you said 
you would take 
me to 
California

I 
thought 
you meant Coachella, 
or 
Disneyland
. Why here? 

T'CHALLA 
This is where our father 
killed 
our 
uncle. 

Shuri 
looks 
at T'Challa, 
shocked 
by his 
bluntness. 
She turns 
and stares 
closely 
at the building. 
We see her POV of large 
SIGNAGE that 
hints 
that 
the building 
is soon to be 
demolished
. 


SHURI 
They are tearing 
it 
down. Good. 

T'CHALLA 
They're 
not tearing

And that 
building

one 
over there ... 
This will 
be the

smiles 
at the surprise. 

T'CHALLA (CONT'D) 

Nakia will 
oversee 
the social 
outreach 
... 
And you will 
spearhead

exchange
. 

Shuri 
turns 
to T'Challa 
in shock at what this 
means. 

SHURI 
You're

T'Challa 
hits 
a button 
on his 
Kimoyo bead , and the RTF comes 
out of cloaking

itself 
to have been parked 
behind

Several

a hush falls 
over 
the 
hall 
as the Wakandans 

enter 
and walk up to the 
center 
pit. 

T'CHALLA 
My name is King T'Challa
, son of 
King T'Chaka . I am the 
sovereign 
ruler 
of the Nation 
of Wakanda and 
for the 
first 
time 
in our history 
we will 
be sharing 
our knowledge 

and resources 
with 
the 
outside 

world. 
Wakanda will 
no longer 
watch 

from the 
shadows . We cannot
, we 

must not. 
We will 
work to be an 
example 
of how we as brothers 
and 
sisters 
on this 
Earth 
should 
treat 
each other
. Now more than 
ever , 

illusions 
of division 
threaten 
our 
very 
existence. 
We all 
know the 
truth
: more connects 
us than 
separates 
us . In times 
of crisis
, 

the wise 
build 
bridges
, while 
the 
foolish 
build 
barriers
. We must 
find 
a way to look after 
one 
another, 
as if we were one single 
tribe
. 

The audience 
of WORLD LEADERS look 
around , bemused, 
wondering 
what Wakanda could 
possibly 
have to offer
. 

A FRENCH AMBASSADOR 
can't 
help 
but lean 
into 
his 
microphone
. 

FRENCH AMBASSADOR 

With all 
due respect
, King 
T'Challa
, what can a nation 
of 
farmers 
offer 
to the

Search Team Leader: Are you the guys from Washington?
SHIELD Tech: You get many other visitors out here?
SHIELD Lieutenant: How long have you been on site?
Search Team Leader: Since this morning. A Russian oil team called it in about 18 hours ago.
SHIELD Lieutenant: How come nobody spotted it before?
Search Team Leader: It’s really not that surprising. This landscape’s changing all the time. You got any ideas what this thing is exactly?
SHIELD Lieutenant: I don’t know. It’s probably a weather balloon.
Search Team Leader: I don’t think so. You know we don’t have the equipment for a job like this.
SHIELD Tech: How long before we can start craning it out?
Search Team Leader: I don’t think you quite understand. You guys are gonna need one hell of a crane!
[as the shot widens we see a massive frozen ship revealed]
[after breaking into the metal aircraft]
SHIELD Lieutenant: [speaking into his comm] Base, we’re in. [looking around] What is this? [The technician nearly slipps on the ice covering the ground] Careful.
SHIELD Tech: [finding the frozen shield of Captain America] Lieutenant! What is it?
SHIELD Lieutenant: My God! [into his earpiece] Base, give me a line to the Colonel.
Voice from Earpiece: It’s 3 a.m., sir.
SHIELD Lieutenant: I don’t care what time it is. This one’s waited long enough.
[March 1942 Tønsberg, Norway]
[a villager, Jan, is running to a church]
Jan: [subtitled] They have come for it!
Tower Keeper: [subtitled] They have before.
Jan: [subtitled] Not like this.
Tower Keeper: [subtitled] Let them come. They will never find it.
[rumbling is heard and something breaks down the door, the stones killing Jan]
[the tower keeper closes Jan’s eyes and sees a machine moving away as HYDRA agents come in]
[a car drives up with the HYDRA symbol on the hood]
[HYDRA agents try to lift the lid of a coffin]
Hydra Lieutenant: Open it! Quickly, before he…
Johann Schmidt: It has taken me a long time to find this place. [to the Tower Keeper] You should be commended. [to one of his soldiers] Help him up.
[one of the soldiers helps the tower keeper to his feet]
Johann Schmidt: I think that you are man of great vision. And in this way we are much alike.
Tower Keeper: I am nothing like you.
Johann Schmidt: No, of course. But what others see as superstition, you and I know to be a science.
Tower Keeper: What you seek is just a legend.
Johann Schmidt: Then why make such an effort to conceal it? [opens an old tomb and picks up the glass cube from the skeletal remains of an old Viking] The Tesseract was the jewel of Odin’s treasure room. [he turns to face the tower keeper and deliberately drops and smashes the glass cube] It’s not something one buries. But I think it is close, yes?
Tower Keeper: I cannot help you.
Johann Schmidt: No. But maybe you can help your village. You must have some friends out there. Some… some little grandchildren perhaps. I have no need for them to die. [A big tank outside turns his guns towards the village threateningly.]
[referring to the carving of the tree on one of the tower walls]
Johann Schmidt: Yggdrasil. Tree of the world. Guardian of wisdom and fate, also. [he presses a button on the carving of the tree and it opens up to reveal the real cube] And the Führer digs for trinkets in the desert. You have never seen this, have you?
Tower Keeper: It’s not for the eyes of ordinary men.
Johann Schmidt: Exactly. [he closes the box containing the glowing cube and turns to his soldiers] Gove the order to open fire.
Hydra Lieutenant: Jawohl! (Yes!)
Tower Keeper: Fool! You cannot control the power you hold. You will burn!
Johann Schmidt: I already have. [He shoots and kills the tower keeper]
[In New York, at the enrollment facility.]
4F Doctor: [off-screen] O’Connel, Michael. Kaminsky, Henry.
Steve Rogers: Boy, a lot of guys getting killed over there.
4F Doctor: [off-screen] Rogers, Steven.
[Steve puts down the newspaper he is reading]
Enlistment Guy: It kind of makes you think twice about enlisting, huh?
Steve Rogers: Nope.
[as Steve is standing half naked in front of the doctor to examine him for enlistment]
4F Doctor: Rogers. What did your father die of?
Steve Rogers: Mustard gas. He was in the hundred and seventh infantry. I was hoping I could be assigned…
4F Doctor: Your mother?
Steve Rogers: She was a nurse in a TB ward. Got hit, couldn’t shake it. [the doctor looks at Steve’s file which shows he has a long list of health issues]
4F Doctor: Sorry, son.
Steve Rogers: Look, just give me a chance.
4F Doctor: You’d be ineligible on your asthma alone.
Steve Rogers: Is there anything you can do?
4F Doctor: I’m doing it. I’m saving your life. [He stamps the card 4F.]
[later, Steve is at the movie theater]
[a commercial about the war is playing before the movie]
Commercial Announcer: War continues to ravage Europe. But help is on the way. Every able-bodied young man is lining up to serve his country. Even little Timmy is doing his part collecting scrap metal. Nice work, Timmy!
Loud Jerk: Who cares? Play the movie already!
Steve Rogers: [quietly] Hey, you wanna show some respect?
Commercial Announcer: Meanwhile, overseas, our brave boys are showing the Axis powers that the price freedom is never too high.
Loud Jerk: Let’s got! Get on with it! Hey, just start the cartoon!
Steve Roger: Hey buddy, you wanna shut up?!
[the guy gets up and looks at him]
Commercial Announcer: Together with Allied forces, we’ll face any threat, no matter the size.
[getting beaten in an alley by the loud jerk that was disturbing everyone at the cinema]
Loud Jerk: You just don’t know when to give up, do you?
Steve Rogers: I can do this all day. [and attacks the guy again]
James Barnes: Hey! Pick on someone your own size.
[after saving Steve from getting any further beatings by the loud jerk]
James Barnes: Sometimes, I think you like getting punched.
Steve Rogers: I had him on the ropes.
[picks up Steve’s enlistment form from the ground]
James Barnes: How many times is this?
[reading from the enlistment form]
James Barnes: Oh, you’re from Paramus now? You know it’s illegal to lie on the enlistment form. And seriously, Jersey?
Steve Rogers: You get your orders?
James Barnes: The one-o-seventh. Sergeant James Barnes. Shipping out for England first thing tomorrow.
Steve Rogers: I should be going.
James Barnes: Come on, man. My last night! Gotta get you cleaned up.
Steve Rogers: Why? Where are we going?
James Barnes: The future.
[he hands him the newspaper he was holding, Steve opens it to see the ad for World Exposition Of Tomorrow, 1943]
James Barnes: I don’t see what the problem is. You’re about to be the last eligible man in New York. You know, there’s three and a half million women here.
Steve Rogers: Well, I’d settle for just one.
James Barnes: Good thing I took care of that.
[He waves to the dates, Connie and Bonnie, he’s lined up]
Connie: Hey, Bucky!
Steve Rogers: What did you tell her about me?
James Barnes: Only the good stuff.
[music starts playing]
Expo Announcer: Welcome to the Modern Marvels Paviliion and the World of Tomorrow. A greater world. A better world.
Connie: Oh, my God! It’s starting!
Mandy: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Howard Stark!
[Howard enters the stage and kisses the announcer]
Random Woman: I love you, Howard!
Howard Stark: [addressing the audience at the World Exposition fair] Ladies and gentlemen, what if I told you that in just a few short years, your automobile won’t even have to touch the ground at all.
[the female helpers take the wheels of the car on stage]
Howard Stark: Yes. Thanks, Mandy. [addressing the audience again] With Stark robotic reversion technology, you’ll be able to do just that.
[he turns on the switch of his machine and the car starts to hover off the ground]
James Barnes: Holy cow.
[the robots making the car hover suddenly malfunction and the car falls back on stage]
Howard Stark: I did say a few years, didn’t I?
[everyone laughs]
[Steve disappears, and Bucky notices]
James Barnes: Hey, Steve, what do you say we treat these girls…
[at a recruitment center]
Woman: [to her male company, pulling him away from a mirror making him look like a soldier] Come on, soldier.
[Steve steps in front of the mirror but he’s too short to fill out the face]
James Barnes: Come on. You’re kind of missing the point of a double date. We’re taking the girls dancing.
Steve Rogers: You go ahead. I’ll catch up with you.
James Barnes: You’re really gonna do this again?
Steve Rogers: Well, it’s a fair. I’m gonna try my luck.
James Barnes: As who? Steve from Ohio? They’ll catch you. Or worse, they’ll actually take you.
Steve Rogers: Look, I know you don’t think I can do this.
James Barnes: This isn’t a back alley, Steve. It’s war!
Steve Rogers: I know it’s a war. You don’t have to tell me.
James Barnes: Why are you so keen to fight? There are so many important jobs.
Steve Rogers: What am I gonna do? Collect scrap metal…
James Barnes: Yes!
Steve Rogers: …in my little red wagon.
James Barnes: Why not?
Steve Rogers: I’m not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.
James Barnes: I don’t…
Steve Rogers: Bucky, come on! There are men laying down their lives. I got no right to do any less than them. That’s what you don’t understand. This isn’t about me.
James Barnes: Right. Cause you got nothing to prove.
Connie: Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?
James Barnes: [he turns to the girls] Yes, we are. [back to Steve] Don’t do anything stupid until I get back.
Steve Rogers: How can I? You’re taking all the stupid with you.
James Barnes: You’re a punk.
[he walks back towards Steve and hugs him goodbye]
Steve Rogers: Jerk. Be careful.
[as James is walking away]
Steve Rogers: Don’t win the war till I get there!
James Barnes: [He salutes then starts to walk away] Come on girls. They’re playing our song.
[Steve is in a medical examination room when a nurse whispers something inaudible to Young Doctor]
Young Doctor: Wait here.
Steve Rogers: Is there a problem?
Young Doctor: Just wait here. [walks out]
[Steve looks at a sign warning against lying on your enlistment form and starts to get ready to leave]
[An Enlistment Office MP walks in the room and Steve looks up at him worriedly]
[Dr. Abraham Erskine enters the room as Enlistment Office MP quietly leaves]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [to the MP] Thank you. [to Steve] So, you want to go overseas. Kill some Nazis.
Steve Rogers: Excuse me?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Dr. Abraham Erskine. [walks over and introduces himself to Steve] I represent the Strategic Scientific Reserve.
Steve Rogers: Steve Rogers.
[Dr. Erskine starts looking through Steve’s file]
Steve Rogers: Where are you from?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Queens. 73rd Street and Utopia Parkway. Before that, Germany. This troubles you?
Steve Rogers: [shakes his head] No.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [flipping through Steve’s file] Where are you from, Mr. Rogers? Mmm? Is it New Haven? Or Paramus? Five exams in five different cities.
Steve Rogers: That might not be the right file.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: No, it’s not the exams I’m interested in. It’s the five tries. But you didn’t answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis?
Steve Rogers: Is this a test?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yes.
Steve Rogers: I don’t wanna kill anyone. I don’t like bullies. I don’t care where they’re from.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Well, there are already so many big men fighting this war. Maybe what we need now is the little guy, huh? I can offer you a chance.
[They exit the room]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Only a chance.
Steve Rogers: I’ll take it.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good. So where is the little guy from, actually?
Steve Rogers: Brooklyn.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [Dr. Erskine stamps Steve’s form and hands him back his file] Congratulations, soldier.
[Steve opens up the file and sees that he’s been stamped as accepted]
[In a HYDRA lab in a very mountainous region]
Johann Schmidt: Are you ready, Dr. Zola?
Dr. Arnim Zola: My machine requires the most delicate calibration. Forgive me if I seem overcautious.
Johann Schmidt: And are you certain that those conductors of yours can withstand the energy surge long enough for a transference?
Dr. Arnim Zola: With this artifact, I am certain of nothing. I fear it may not work at all.
[Schmidt inserts the Tesseract carefully into the machine. Zola starts it up.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: Twenty percent. Forty. Sixty. Stabilising at 70%.
Johann Schmidt: [takes over the controls] I have not come all this way for safety, Doctor. [He turns the controls up to maximum and blue light flitters through the room.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: What is that?
[after successfully collecting the power from the glowing Tesseract using Zola’s machine]
Johann Schmidt: I must congratulate you, Arnim. Your designs do not disappoint. Though they may require some slight reinforcement.
Dr. Arnim Zola: The exchange is stable. Amazing! The energy we have just collected could power my design, all my designs. This will change the war.
Johann Schmidt: Dr. Zola, this will change the world.
[At a US training camp. Steve stands in line with others.]
Officer: [off-screen to other soldiers training] Ready, exercise!
Peggy Carter: Recruits, attention! Gentlemen, I’m Agent Carter. I supervise all operations for this division.
Gilmore Hodge: What’s with the accent, Queen Victoria? Thought I was signing up for the U.S. Army.
Peggy Carter: What’s your name, soldier?
Gilmore Hodge: Gilmore Hodge, your Majesty.
Peggy Carter: Step forward, Hodge.
[Hodge steps forward, smirking]
Peggy Carter: Put your right foot forward.
Gilmore Hodge: Mmm… We gonna wrassle? Cause I got a few moves I know you’ll like.
[suddenly Peggy punches him hard in the face]
[Col.Phillips drives up]
Col. Chester Phillips: Agent Carter.
Peggy Carter: Colonel Phillips.
Col. Chester Phillips: I see you’re breaking in the candidates. That’s good! [to Hodge] Get your ass up out of that dirt and stand in that line at attention 'til somebody comes tells you what to do.
Gilmore Hodge: [he gets back up] Yes, sir.
Col. Chester Phillips: [addressing the new army recruits] General Patton has said that wars are fought with weapons but they are won by men. We are going to win this war because we have the best men… [he sees Rogers and continues talking] And because they’re gonna get better. Much better. The Strategic Scientific Reserve is an Allied effort made up of the best minds in the free world. Our goal is to create the best army in history. But every army starts with one man. At the end of this week we will choose that man. He will be the first in a new breed of super-soldiers. [While Phillips talk we see scenes of Steve unpacking and training where he fails to keep up and gets bullied by the others.]
Sergeant Duffy: Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!
Col. Chester Phillips: And they, will personally escort Adolf Hitler to the gates of Hell.
[then we see Steve and some other trainees running up to a waiting Peggy and a flagpole]
Sergeant Duffy: Pick up the pace, ladies! Let’s go! Double time! Come on! Faster! Faster! Move! Move! [they arrive at the flag pole] Squad, halt! That flag means we’re only at the halfway point. First man to bring it to me gets a ride back with Agent Carter. Move, move!
Soldiers: Come on! Get up there!
Sergeant Duffy: [the soldier try to climb up the pole to no avail] If that’s all you got, this army’s in trouble! Get up there, Hodge! Come on! Get up there! Nobody’s got that flag in 17 years! Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in! Let’s go! Get back into formation! Rogers! I said fall in! [Steve pulls a pin out at the bottom of the pole causing it to fall over.]
Steve Rogers: [as he gives the flag to Sergeant Duffy] Thank you, sir. [He climbs into the car and they drive away.]
[The soldiers are doing push-ups.]
Peggy Carter: Faster, ladies! Come on. My grandmother has more life in her, God rest her soul. Move it!
Col. Chester Phillips: [walking besides Erskine] You’re not really thinking about picking Rogers, are you?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: I am more than just thinking about it. He is the clear choice.
Col. Chester Phillips: When you brought a ninety-pound asthmatic onto my army base, I let it slide. I thought, what the hell? Maybe he’ll be useful to you, like a gerbil. I never thought you’d pick him. [referring to Steve]
Peggy Carter: [as Phillips and Erskine arrive she commands the soldiers:] Up.
Col. Chester Phillips: You stick a needle in that kids arm and it’s gonna go right through him. [watching Steve struggling whilst training with the other new recruits]
Peggy Carter: Come on, girls.
Col. Chester Phillips: Look at that. He’s making me cry.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.
Col. Chester Phillips: Do you know how long it took to set up this project?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah, I know.
Col. Chester Phillips: All the groveling I had to do in front of Senator What’s-His-Name’s committees?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Brandt. Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.
Col. Chester Phillips: Then throw me a bone. Hodge passed every test we gave him. He’s big, he’s fast, he obeys orders. He’s a soldier.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: He’s a bully.
Col. Chester Phillips: You don’t win wars with niceness, doctor. [he takes a hand grenade] You win war with guts. [he throws the grenade at where the new recruits are training] Grenade!
[all the soldiers move away quickly but Steve jumps on top of it covering it with his body]
Steve Rogers: Get away! Get back! [waits for the grenade to go off but nothing happens]
Officer: It was a dummy grenade. All clear. Back in formation.
[Steve looks at Phillips and Erskine]
Steve Rogers: Is this is a test?
[Erskine looks at Phillips as to confirm his point about choosing Steve]
Col. Chester Phillips: He’s still skinny.
[later that night, Steve sits on his bunk reading. Erskine knocks on the door.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: May I?
Steve Rogers: Yeah.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Can’t sleep?
Steve Rogers: I got the jitters, I guess.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [laughs] Me, too.
Steve Rogers: Can I ask you a question?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Just one? [he sits down facing Steve]
Steve Rogers: Why me?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: I suppose that is the only question that matters. [He looks down at the bottle of schnapps he brought with him.] This is from Augsburg. My city. So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi’s invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the… my people struggled. They… they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the… and the… [he waves his hand] And he… he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, "You." He says, "You will make us strong." Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of HYDRA, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he’s ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth, left here by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist.
[flashback of how Schmidt takes Erskine’s formula and injects himself with it]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Schmidt must become that superior man.
Steve Rogers: Did it make him stronger?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.
Steve Rogers: Thanks. I think.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [he pours 2 drinks] Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.
[Steve holds up his glass to toast]
Steve Rogers: To the little guys.
[just as Steve’s about to drink from his glass]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: No! No! Wait! Wait! What I am doing? No! You have a procedure tomorrow. No fluids.
[he pours the contents of Steve’s glass into his own]
Steve Rogers: All right. We’ll drink it after.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: No! I don’t have procedure tomorrow. Drink it after? Drink it now!
[At the Hydra facility, in Schmidt’s lab.]
Johann Schmidt: [he turns off the light] Is there something in particular you need? [An artist is painting Schmidt’s portrait in oil.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: I understand you found him.
Johann Schmidt: See for yourself. [Zola steps over to the table to find several survaillance photos of Dr. Erskine.] You disapprove.
Dr. Arnim Zola: I just don’t see why you need concern yourself. I can’t imagine he will succeed. [looking nervously at Schmidt] Again.
Johann Schmidt: His serum is the Allies’ only defence against this power we now possess. If we take it away from them, then our victory is assured.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Shall I give the order?
Johann Schmidt: It has been given.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Good. [he turns to go]
Johann Schmidt: Dr. Zola. [he turns on the lights] What do you think?
Dr. Arnim Zola: A masterpiece. [the artist looks relieved with Zola’s assessment]
[Steve and Peggy whilst driving through Brooklyn]
Steve Rogers: I know this neighborhood. I got beat up in that alley. And that parking lot. And behind that diner.
Peggy Carter: Did you have something against running away?
Steve Rogers: You start running they’ll never let you stop. You stand up, push back. Can’t say no forever, right?
Peggy Carter: I know a little of what that’s like. To have every door shut in your face.
Steve Rogers: I guess I just don’t why you’d wanna join the army if you’re a beautiful dame. Or a beautiful… a woman. An agent, not a dame! You are beautiful, but…
Peggy Carter: You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?
Steve Rogers: This is the longers conversation I’ve had with one. Women aren’t exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on.
Peggy Carter: You must have danced?
Steve Rogers: Well, asking a woman to dance always seems so terrifying. And the past few years just didn’t seem to matter that much. Figured I’d wait.
Peggy Carter: For what?
Steve Rogers: The right partner.
[They pull up by an antiques shop and get out of the car.]
Peggy Carter: This way.
Steve Rogers: What are we doing here?
Peggy Carter: Follow me. [They go inside.]
Antique Store Owner: Wonderful weather this morning isn’t it?
Peggy Carter: Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.
[Peggy leads Steve into the hidden lab to Dr. Erskine and his team in a big circular room filled with machinery and a pod in the middle.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good morning. [he shakes Steve’s hand and sombody takes a photograph] Please, not now. [The photographer walks away, Steve looks at the pod] Are you ready? [Steve nods.] Good. Take off your shirt, your tie and your hat.
[In the adjacent observation chamber filled with officials.]
Col. Chester Phillips: Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.
Senator Brandt: Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?
Col. Chester Phillips: We needed access to the city’s power grid. Of course, if you’d given me the generators I requisitioned…
Senator Brandt: A lot of people are asking for funds, Colonel. [referring to his company] Oh, this is…
Heinz Kruger: Fred Clemson, State Department. [He shakes Phillips’ hand] If this project of yours comes through, we’d like to see it used for something other than headlines.
Senator Brandt: [looing down into the chamber at Steve] Jesus. Somebody get that kid a sandwich.
[In the chamber Steve has climbed into the pod and lain down.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Comfortable?
Steve Rogers: It’s a little big. You save me any of that schnapps?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Not as much as I should have. Sorry. Next time. Mr. Stark, how are your levels?
Howard Stark: Levels at 100%.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good.
Howard Stark: We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn, but we are ready as we’ll ever be.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Agent Carter? Don’t you think you would be more comfortable in the booth?
Peggy Carter: Oh, yes. Of course. Sorry.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good. [He takes a microphone and taps it.] Do you hear me? is this on? [to the small group gathered to watch Steve being prepared to become a super-solider] Ladies and gentlemen, today we take not another step towards annihilation, but the first step on the path to peace. We begin with a series of micro injections into the subjects major muscle groups. The serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change. And then to stimulate growth, the subject will be saturated with Vita-Rays.
Steve Rogers: [after preliminary injection] That wasn’t so bad.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: That was penicillin. [to the others] Serum infusion beginning in five, four, three, two, one. [The serum is injected into Steve] Now, Mr. Stark. [Stark lowers a leaver, the pod moves upright and encloses Steve inside.] [knocking on the capsule that they’ve locked Steven in for the procedure to change him] Steven, can you hear me?
Steve Rogers: It’s probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [turns to Stark] We will proceed.
Howard Stark: [manages the controls] That’s ten percent. Twenty percent. Thirty. That’s 40 %.
SSR Doctor: Vital signs are normal.
Howard Stark: That’s 50 %. Sixty. Seventy.
[as Steve is screaming in pain as he is receiving the vita rays]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Steven!
Peggy Carter: Shut it down.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Steven! [he knocks on the pod]
Peggy Carter: Shut it down!
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark! Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!
Steve Rogers: No! Don’t! I can do this!
Howard Stark: Eighty. Ninety. That’s 100 %. [Everything overloads until the reactor closes itself down.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Mr. Stark? [Stark opens the pod]
[after being transformed into a super-soldier]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Steven. Steven.
Col. Chester Phillips: The son of a bitch did it. [as everyone poors out of the observation chamber Kruger leaves a small, metal object like a cigarett case behind.]
Steve Rogers: [As he stumbles out of the pod supported by Stark and Erskine] I did it.
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah, yeah. I think we did it.
Howard Stark: We actually did it.
Peggy Carter: How do you feel?
Steve Rogers: Taller.
Peggy Carter: You look taller.
Col. Chester Phillips: How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?
Senator Brandt: I can think of some folks in Berlin who are about to get very nervous. Congratulations, Doctor. [He shakes hands with Erskine.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Thank you, sir.
[Kruger detonates the bomb in the observation room and uses the confusion to steal the last vial of the serum.]
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Stop him! [Kruger shoots him and flees with Peggy chasing after him]
[Steve kneels beside Erskine who points at Steve’s chest and dies.]
[Kruger shoots his way to a get-away-car but soon after he drives away, Peggy shoots the driver and the car crashes into a taxi so Kruger changes cars.]
Taxi Driver: What are you doing? Buddy, are you all right? Hey, this guy’s been shot!
[Kruger drives off in the taxi, straight towards Peggy. She shoots at him but he just ducks and keeps going. Steve shoves her out of the way.]
Peggy Carter. I had him!
Steve Rogers: Sorry! [he runs after the cab] [While chasing the car he loses control over his new power and crashes into a bridalwear store.] I’m sorry. [he runs out into a street full of cars] Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[Steve catches up to Kruger’s car a the pier and causes him to lose control. Kruger gets out of the car and takes a young boy hostage.]
Mother: No! No! Not my son!
Young Boy: Stop it!
Mother: Don’t hurt him!
Heinz Kruger: Get back! [Kruger with the boy dangling in his arms runs away.]
Young Boy: Let me go!
Mother: Let go of my son! Don’t hurt him!
Steve Rogers: [as Kruger points a gun at the boy’s head.] Wait, don’t! Don’t! [Kruger points the gun at Steve and pulls the trigger, but the gun is empty. So instead he throws the boy into the water.] No! Don’t! [Kruger runs, Steve looks down at the boy.]
Young Boy: Go get him! I can swim!
[Kruger tries to escape in a submarine, but Steve jumps into the water, breaks the window an pulls Kruger out back onto dry land. As they struggle further the vial breaks.]
Steve Rogers: Who the hell are you?
Heinz Kruger: The first of many. Cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Hail HYDRA! [he pops a fake tooth loose and swallows it, he starts to foam at the mouth and then die]
[At HYDRA HQ]
Hutter: The Führer is not accustomed to being ignored, Herr Schmidt. He funds your research because you promised him weapons.
Schneider: You serve at his pleasure. He gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries.
Johann Schmidt: Reward? Call it what it is. Exile. I no longer reflect his image of Aryan perfection.
Roeder: You think this is about appearances? Your HYDRA division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year. And we had learned through local intelligence you had mounted a full-scale incursion into Norway.
Schneider: The Führer feels… How does he put it? "The Red Skull has been indulged long enough!"
Johann Schmidt: Gentlemen, you have come to see the results of our work. Let me show you. [They enter the lab.] Hitler speaks of a thousand-year Reich, but he cannot feed his army for a month. His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe. But still he is no closer to achieving his goals.
Roeder: And I suppose you still aim to end this war through magic?
Johann Schmidt: Science. But I understand your confusion. Great power has always baffled primitive men. HYDRA is assembling an arsenal to destroy my enemies in one stroke. Where ever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess. All in a matter of hours.
Roeder: Your enemies?
Johann Schmidt: My weapons contain enough destructive power to decimate every hostile capital on earth. Quite simply, gentlemen, I have harnessed the power of the Gods.
Schneider: Thank you, Schmidt.
Johann Schmidt: For what?
Schneider: For making it clear how obviously mad you are.
Hutter: [studying a map lying in Schmidt’s labor.] Berlin is on this map!
Johann Schmidt: So it is.
Hutter: You will be punished for your insolence! You will be brought before the Führer himself! [Schmidt kills them all with his new Tesseract-powered canon.]
Roeder: [screams before he’s desintegrated] Schmidt!!!
Johann Schmidt: My apolpgies, Doctor, but we both knew HYDRA could grow no further in Hitler’s shadow. Hail HYDRA.
HYDRA technicians: Hail HYDRA! [raising both arms to salute]
Dr. Arnim Zola: [when Schmidt turns to him] Hail HYDRA!
[At the SSR compound.]
Steve Rogers: [referring to the amount of blood samples taken from him] Think you got enough?
Peggy Carter: Any hope of reproducing a program is locked in your genetic code. But without Dr. Erskine, it could take years.
Steve Rogers: He deserved more than this.
Peggy Carter: If it could only work once, he’d be proud it was you.
[SSR tech lab with the Hydra submarine]
Senator Brandt: Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.
Col. Chester Phillips: Great. Why don’t we start with how a German spy got a ride to my secret installation in your car? [to Stark who is working on the submarine] What have we got here?
Howard Stark: Speaking modestly, I’m the best mechanical engineer in this country. But I don’t know what’s inside this thing or how it works. We’re not even close to this technology.
Senator Brandt: Then who is?
Col. Chester Phillips: HYDRA. I’m sure you’ve been reading our briefings.
Senator Brandt: I’m on a number of committees, Colonel.
Peggy Carter: HYDRA is the Nazi deep science division. It’s led by Johann Schmidt. But he has much bigger ambitions.
Col. Chester Phillips: HYDRA’s practically a cult. They worship Schmidt, they think he’s invincible.
Senator Brandt: So what are you gonna do about it?
Col. Chester Phillips: Spoke to the president this morning. As of today the SSR is being retasked.
Peggy Carter: Colonel?
Col. Chester Phillips: We are taking the fight to HYDRA. Pack your bags Agent Carter. You too, Stark. You’re flying to London tonight.
Steve Rogers: Sir, if you’re going after Schmidt, I want in.
Col. Chester Phillips: You’re an experiment. You’re going to Alamogordo.
Steve Rogers: The serum worked.
Col. Chester Phillips: I asked for an army and all I got was you. You are not enough.
Senator Brandt: [to Steve] With all due respect to the Colonel, I think we may be missing the point. I’ve seen you in action, Steve. More importantly, the country’s seen it. [to his aide] Paper.[the aide shows them the news paper (‘The New York Examiner’ Vol. XCVII No. 33.634, Wednesday, June 23, 1943), headlines: "Nazis in New York - mystery man saves child"] The enlistment lines have been around the block since your picture hit the newsstands. You don’t take a soldier, a symbol like that, and hide him in a lab. Son, do you want to serve your country on the most important battlefield of the war?
Steve Rogers: Sir, that’s all I want.
Senator Brandt: Then, congratulations. You just got promoted.
Steve Rogers: [backstage as Steve is getting dressed in super-hero costume] I don’t know if I can do this.
Brandt’s Aide: Nothing to it. Sell off a few bonds, bonds buy bullets, bullets kills Nazi’s. Bing bang boom. You’re an American hero.
Steve Rogers: It’s just not how I pictured getting there.
Brandt’s Aide: The senator’s got a lot of pull up on the hill. You play ball with us, you’ll be leading your own platoon in no time. Take the shield. [as Steve puts on his head mask he pushes Steve onto the stage]
USO Singer: Who’s strong and brave, here to save the American way?
Steve Rogers: [As women start to sing and dance in the background Steve reads:] Not all of us can storm a beach or drive a tank. But there’s still a way all of us can fight.
USO Singer: Who vows to fight like a man, for what’s right, night and day?
Steve Rogers: Series E Defence Bonds. Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun.
USO Singer: Who will campaign door-to-door for America? Carry the flag shore to shore for America? From Hoboken to Spokane, the star-spangeld man with a plan.
[Steve leads a group of men dressed as soldiers in front of a moving image.]
Director: Cut. Guys, don’t look ath the camera.
[back to a scene where he’s on tour.]
USO Singer: We can’t ignore there’s a threat and a war we must win.
Steve Rogers: Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy’s gun.
USO Singer: Who’ll hang a noose on the goose-stepping goons from Berlin? Who will redeem, heed the call for America? Who’ll rise or fall, give his all for America? Who’s here to prove that we can? The star-spangled man with a plan.
Steve Rogers: We all know this is about trying to win the war. We can’t do that without bullets and bandages, tanks and tents. That’s where you come in. Every bond you buy will help protect someone you love. [A men dressed as hitler sneaks up on him on the stage.]
Kids in USO Audience: Turn around! He’s right behind you!
Steve Rogers: Keep our boys armed and ready, and the Germans will think twice about trying to get the drop on us. [The man attacs him and gets fake-punched.]
USO Singer: Stalwart and steady and true, forcefull and ready to defend, the red, white, and blue. Who’ll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox? Far as an eagle will soar. Who’s making Adolf afraid to step out of his box? He knows what we’re fighting for. Who waked the giant that napped in America? We know it’s no one but Captain America. Who’ll finish what they began? Who’ll kick the Krauts to Japan? The star-spangled man with a aplan! [Scenes show how Captain America goes on tour around America, appears in comics and films, how he’s approached by multiple fans, and generally becomes more liked and famous.]
[Italy, November 1943, 5 miles from the front. Steve addresses a crowd of soldiers dressed in his super-hero costume]
Steve Rogers: How many of you ready to help me sock old Adolf on the jaw? [silence from the crowd of soldiers] Okay. Uh… I need a volunteer.
Army Heckler#1: I already volunteered! How do you think I got here? [the crowd of soldiers laugh] Bring back the girls! [there’s a cheer from the soldiers]
Steve Rogers: I think they only know the one song. But um…let me…I’ll…I’ll see what I can do.
Army Heckler#1: You do that, sweetheart.
Army Heckler#2: Nice boots, Tinker Bell! [the crowd of soldiers laugh]
Steve Rogers: Come on, guys. We’re all on the same team here.
Army Heckler#3: Hey, Captain! Sign this! [he stands turns and pulls his pants down and the crowd starts to throw things at Steve.]
Army Heckler#4: Bring back the girls! [The women run on stage and the crowd cheers.]
Brandt’s Aide: [backstage to Steve] Don’t worry, pal. They’ll warm up to you. Don’t worry.
[Later, Steve sits on the edge of the stage sketching as rain pours down in the background.]
Peggy Carter: Hello, Steve.
Steve Rogers: [He turns and looks up at Peggy.] Hi.
Peggy Carter: Hi.
Steve Rogers: What are you doin’ here?
Peggy Carter: Officially I’m not here at all. That was quite a performance.
Steve Rogers: Yeah. Uh… I had to improvise a little bit. Crowds I’m used to are usually more uh… twelve.
Peggy Carter: I understand you’re "America’s New Hope"?
Steve Rogers: Bond sales take a ten percent bump in every state I visit.
Peggy Carter: Is that Senator Brandt I hear?
Steve Rogers: At least he’s got me doin’ this. Phillips would have had be stuck in lab.
Peggy Carter: And these are your only two options? A lab rat or a dancing monkey? You were meant for more than this, you know? [Steve goes to respond but hesitates] What?
Steve Rogers: You know for the longest time I dreamed about coming overseas and being on the front lines. Serving my country. I finally get everything I wanted, and I’m wearing tights. [Honking in the background as an ambulance arrives with wounded soldiers. Steve and Peggy turn around to watch.] They look like they’ve been through hell.
Peggy Carter: These men more than most. Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano. Two hundred men went up against him and less than fifty returned. Your audience contained what was left of the one-oh-seventh. The rest were killed or captured.
Steve Rogers: The one-oh-seventh?
Peggy Carter: What?
Steve Rogers: Come on! [They run to a tent.] Colonel Phillips.
Col. Chester Phillips: Well, if it isn’t the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan. And what is your plan today?
Steve Rogers: I need the casualty list from Azzano.
Col. Chester Phillips: You don’t get to give me orders, son.
Steve Rogers: I just need one name. Sergeant James Barnes from the hundred and seventh.
Col. Chester Phillips: [pointing to Peggy] You and I are gonna have a conversation later that you won’t enjoy.
Steve Rogers: Please tell me if he’s alive, sir. B-A-R…
Col. Chester Phillips: I can spell. [referring to Barnes] I have signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count. But the name does sound familiar. I’m sorry.
Steve Rogers: What about the others? Are you planning a rescue mission?
Col. Chester Phillips: Yeah! It’s called winning the war.
Steve Rogers: But if you know where they are, why not at least…?
Col. Chester Phillips: They’re thirty miles behind the lines. Through the most heavily fortified territory in Europe. We’d lose more men than we’d save. But I don’t expect you to understand that, because you’re a chorus girl.
Steve Rogers: I think I understand just fine.
Col. Chester Phillips: Well then understand it somewhere else. If I read the posters correctly, you got some place to be in thirty minutes. [as Phillips walks away Steve looks at the military map which shows where the men are]
Steve Rogers: Yes, sir. I do.
Col. Chester Phillips: [To Peggy] If you have something to say, right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.
Peggy Carter: [She follows Steve to his tent where he starts to change and pack some things.] What do you plan to do? Walk to Austria?
Steve Rogers: If that’s what it takes.
Peggy Carter: You heard the Colonel, your friend is most likely dead.
Steve Rogers: You don’t know that.
Peggy Carter: Even so, he’s devising a strategy. If he detects…
Steve Rogers: By the time he’s done that, it could be too late! [He walks out to a jeep.] You told me you thought I was meant for more than this. Did you mean that?
Peggy Carter: Every word.
Steve Rogers: Then you gotta let me go. [He gets in the jeep.]
Peggy Carter: I can do more than that.
[backstage with the USO girls]
Brandt’s Aide: On stage, girls. Five minutes!
USO girl: Where’s my helmet?
Brandt’s Aide: Has anyone seen Rogers?
[Peggy and Steve in a plane piloted by Stark.]
Peggy Carter: The HYDRA camp is in Krausberg, tucked between these two mountain ranges. It’s a factory of some kind.
Howard Stark: We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep.
Steve Rogers: Just get me as close as you can. [referring to Stark and Peggy helping him] You know, you two are gonna be in a lot of trouble at the lab.
Peggy Carter: And you won’t?
Steve Rogers: Where I’m goin’, if anybody yells at me I can just shoot ‘em.
Peggy Carter: They will undoubtedly shoot back.
Steve Rogers: Well, let’s hope it’s good for somethin’. [He knocks at his shield.]
Howard Stark: Agent Carter, if we’re not in too much of a hurry I thought we could stop off in Lucerne for a late night fondue. [Peggy looks awkwardly at Steve who’s getting ready to parachute.]
Peggy Carter: Stark is the best civilian pilot I’ve ever seen. He’s mad enough to brave this airspace, we’re lucky to have him.
Steve Rogers: So are you two…? Do you…? Fondue?
Peggy Carter: [She ignores Steve’s akward and confused rambling.] This is your transponder. Activate it when you’re ready and the signal will lead us straight to you.
Steve Rogers: Are you sure this thing works?
Howard Stark: It’s been tested more than you, pal. [as their plane is being attacked Steve goes towards the opened door of the plane to jump]
Peggy Carter: Get back here! We’re taking you all the way in.
Steve Rogers: As soon as I’m free, you turn this thing around and get the hell outta here!
Peggy Carter: You can’t give me orders!
Steve Rogers: The hell I can’t! I’m a Captain! [he looks at her and then jumps out of the plane]
[In the Hydra factory located in Italy, Schmidt and Zola walk side by side through the workspace.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: As you can see, production of the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule, even with components of this size.
Johann Schmidt: Increase the output by 60 % and see to it our other facilities do the same.
Dr. Arnim Zola: But the prisoners, I’m not sure they have the strength.
Johann Schmidt: Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor. There are always more workers.
Dr. Arnim Zola: [To someone approaching him with a clip board] Not now!
[At the cells where prisoners are lead into. One of the guards knocks the hat from Dumdum Dugan’s head.]
Dum Dum Dugan: You know, Fritz, one of these days, I’m gonna have a stick of my own.
[Steve runs through the dark woods until he finds a road where trucks a driving by. He gets into the back of one of them and finds himself face to face with two Hydra guards.]
Steve Rogers: Fellas.
HYDRA guards: Ah!
[After Steve snuck into the HYDRA factory and stole a blue shining cartridge, he finds some of the captured American soldiers]
Gabe Jones: Who are you supposed to be?
Steve Rogers: I’m… Captain America.
James Montgomery Falsworth: I beg your pardon?
Dum Dum Dugan: [After Steve has unlocked their cells and prisoner start pooring out, he says to a Jim Morita, a Japanese looking man] What, are we taking everybody?
Jim Morita: [takes out his dog tags] I’m from Fresno, Ace.
Steve Rogers: Is there anybody else? I’m looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.
James Montgomery Falsworth: There’s an isolation ward in the factory, but no one’s ever come back from it.
Steve Rogers: All right. The tree line is northwest, 80 yards past the gate. Get out fast and give ‘em hell. I’ll meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else I find.
Gabe Jones: Wait! You know what you’re doin’?
Steve Rogers: Yeah. I’ve knocked out Adolf Hitler over two hundred times.
[The prisoners escape into the compound, overpowering the guards with their sheer numbers. Dernier picks up one of the new Tesseract-powered HYDRA guns.]
Jim Morita: You know how to use that thing? [Dernier shoots, blowing up a wall] Okay.
[HYDRA factory command center]
Johann Schmidt: [stares at a surveillance screen] What is happening? [He presses an alarm.]
[back to the prisoners in the compound, Dum Dum and Jones overtake a small tank.]
Dum Dum Dugan: Hey. Not exactly a Buick.
Gabe Jones: [points at the controls] That one. Zündung. (Ignition.)
Dum Dum Dugan: Zündung?
James Montgomery Falsworth: [jumps into the tank] Get this thing going, Dugan!
Dum Dum Dugan: [to Jones] I didn’t know you spoke German.
Gabe Jones: Three semesters at Howards, switched to French, girls much cuter.
Dum Dum Dugan: Didn’t ask for the resume.
[In the HYDRA control room Schmidt watches Steve on the monitors and decides to activate the self destruct sequence which are counting down from 7 minutes.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: No, no! What are you doing?
Johann Schmidt: Our forces are outmatched. [Zola looks at the screens, then runs out of the room.]
[Dernier and Morita running through the compound with other prisoners.]
Jim Morita: Keep moving! Grab those grenades!
[Schmidt secures the Tesseract while Zola packs the blueprints of his design. Steve sees him in the corridor but hesitates to chase him when he hears someone.]
James Barnes: Sergeant. 32557…
Steve Rogers: [he finds Barnes strapped to a chair in one of Schmidt’s testing labs] Bucky? Oh, my God. [he unstraps him from the chair]
James Barnes: Is that…
Steve Rogers: It’s me. It’s Steve.
James Barnes: Steve?
Steve Rogers: Come on.
James Barnes: Steve.
Steve Rogers: I thought you were dead.
James Barnes: I thought you were smaller. [referring to Steve’s change of appearance]
Steve Rogers: Come on.
James Barnes: What happened to you?
Steve Rogers: I joined the Army. [referring to Steve’s undergoing change to a super-soldier]
James Barnes: Did it hurt?
Steve Rogers: A little.
James Barnes: Is it permanent?
Steve Rogers: So far.
[They flee through the exploding factory until they meet Schmidt and Zola.]
Johann Schmidt: Captain America! How exciting! I’m a great fan of your films. So Dr. Erskine managed it after all. Not exactly an improvement, but still impressive. [Steve punches Schmidt hard in the face]
Steve Rogers: You’ve got no idea.
Johann Schmidt: Haven’t I? [He goes to hit Steve but Steve protects himself with his shield. As they fight, Zola pulls a leaver and the catwalk they are standing on retracts to either side seperating them.] No matter what lies Erskine told you, you see I was his greatest success! [he peels off the skin on his face to reveal that he is the Red Skull]
James Barnes: [to Steve referring to Schmidt’s skinless face] You don’t have one of those, do you?
Johann Schmidt: You are deluded, Captain. You pretend to be a simple soldier, but in reality you are just afraid to admit that we have left humanity behind. Unlike you, I embrace it proudly. Without fear!
Steve Rogers: Then how come you’re running? [Schmidt and Zola continue their escape and so do Steve and Bucky.] Come on, let’s go. Up.
[Schmidt and Zola in an elevator.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: Sir? Are we going to the roof? [The doors open to reveal a one-man-plane] What about me? Where will I sit?
Johann Schmidt: [gives Zola his car keys] Not a scratch, Doctor. Not a scratch. [We see Schmidt and Zola escaping.]
[Steve and Bucky on a catwalk, beneath them everything is on fire, they have to reach the other side of the room over a thin gantry.]
Steve Rogers: Let’s go. One at a time. [Bucky reaches the other side but the gantry collapses behind him.]
James Barnes: Gotta be a rope or something!
Steve Rogers: Just go! Get out of here!
James Barnes: No! Not without you! [Steve jumps over the chasm.]
[In the Amry camp Phillips is dictating a letter to a Corporal.]
Col. Chester Phillips: Senator Brandt, I regret to report that Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the third. Aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful. As a result, I must declare Captain Rogers killed in action. Period.
Peggy Carter: The last surveillance flight is back. No sign of activity.
Col. Chester Phillips: Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.
Corporal: Yes, sir. [he leaves]
Col. Chester Phillips: I can’t touch Stark. He’s rich and he’s the Army’s number one weapons contractor. You are neither one.
Peggy Carter: With respect, sir, I don’t regret my actions. And I don’t think Captain Rogers did either.
Col. Chester Phillips: What makes you think I give a damn about your opinions. I took a chance with you, Agent Carter. And now America’s golden boy and a lot of other good men are dead, cause you had a crush.
Peggy Carter: It wasn’t that. I had faith.
Col. Chester Phillips: Well, I hope that’s a big comfort to you when they shut this division down. [Soldier start running and talking exitedly in the background.] What the hell’s going on out there? [They follow the crowd to the edge of the camp where Steve’S arriving with the freed prisoners.]
Man#1: Look who it is! [everyone cheers]
Steve Rogers: [salutes to Phillips] Some of theres men need medical attention.
Man#2: Medic, we got wounded.
Medic. Right over here.
Steve Rogers: I’d like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.
Col. Chester Phillips: That won’t be necessary.
Steve Rogers: Yes, sir.
Col. Chester Phillips: [he turns and walks away from Steve and he notices Peggy] Faith, huh?
Peggy Carter: [to Steve] You’re late.
Steve Rogers: [holding up the broken transponder] Couldn’t call my ride.
James Barnes: [to the men] Hey! Let’s hear it for Captain America. [more cheering]
Senator Brandt: [somewhere in America talking to a small crowd] I am honoured to present this medal for valour to my personal friend, Captain America! [he turns around but no one is there.] Captain America! [still nothing] Captain, that’s your cue! [his aide comes out, whispering something to him]
General: [sitting in the crowd talking quietly to the man next to him] I thought he’d be taller. [misunderstanding the aide to be Captain America]
[Allied HQ in London]
Steve Rogers: The fifth one was here in Poland, right near the Baltic. [he marks it on a map] And the sixth one was… about here, 30, 40 miles west of the Maginot Line. [a soldier takes the map away] I just got a quick look.
Peggy Carter: Well, nobody’s perfect. [they walk over to Phillips and another map]
Steve Rogers: These are the weapon factories we know about. Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility that isn’t on this map.
Col. Chester Phillips: Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6. I want every Allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.
Peggy Carter: What about us?
Col. Chester Phillips: We are gonna set a fire under Johann Schmidt’s ass. What do you say, Rogers? It’s your map, you think you can wipe Hydra off of it?
Steve Rogers: Yes, sir. I’ll need a team.
Col. Chester Phillips: We’re already putting together the best men.
Steve Rogers: With all due respect, sir. So am I.
[in a bar]
Dum Dum Dugan: So, let’s get this straight.
Gabe Jones: We barely got out of there alive, and you want us to go back?
Steve Rogers: Pretty much.
James Montgomery Falsworth: Sounds rather fun, actually.
Jim Morita: [belches] I’m in.
Gabe Jones: [Dernier and Gabe speaking French, Dernier laughs, they shake hands] We’re in.
Dum Dum Dugan: Hell, I’ll always fight. But you got to do one thing for me.
Steve Rogers: What’s that?
Dum Dum Dugan: Open a tab.
Jim Morita: Well, that was easy.
Steve Rogers: [Steve goes over to the bar.] Another round.
Barkeeper: Where are they putting all this stuff?
James Barnes: [Steve joins Bucky at the barcounter. In the background everyone's singing "There's a Tavern in Town"[1]] See? I told you. They’re all idiots.
Steve Rogers: How about you? You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?
James Barnes: Hell, no. That little guy from Brooklyn who was too dumb not to run away from a fight. I’m following him. But you’re keeping the outfit, right?
Steve Rogers: You know what? It’s kind of growing on me.
Peggy Carter: [The singing in the bar stops as Peggy in a tight fitting, deep-red dress walks in.] Captain.
Steve Rogers: Agent Carter.
James Barnes: Ma’am.
Peggy Carter: Howard has some equipment for you to try. Tomorrow morning?
Steve Rogers: Sounds good.
Peggy Carter: I see you top squad is prepping for duty.
James Barnes: You don’t like music?
Peggy Carter: I do, actually. I might even, when this is all over, go dancing.
James Barnes: Then what are we waiting for?
Peggy Carter. The right partner. 0800, Captain.
Steve Rogers: Yes, ma’m. I’ll be there.
James Barnes: [referring to the rejection he got from Peggy about going dancing with him] I’m invisible. I’m…I’m turning into you. It’s like some horrible dream.
Steve Rogers: Don’t take it so hard. Maybe she’s got a friend. [whilst waiting to see Stark]
Howard Stark: [Morning, by a glass chamber, Stark examines the Hydra cartridge] Emission signature is unusual. Alpha and beta ray neutral. Though I doubt Rogers picked up on that. Seems harmless enough. Hard to see what all the fuss is about. [He removes a glowing pellet. The blast sends Stark and his engineer flying across the room.] Write that down.
[Somewhere else in the building]
Steve Rogers: [to Private Lorraine] Excuse me. I’m looking for Mr. Stark.
Pvt. Lorraine: He’s in with Colonel Phillips. Of course you’re welcome to wait. [Steve perches on the edge of a desk to wait] I read about what you did. [she holds up the newspaper showing his rescue mission]
Steve Rogers: Oh! The…yeah! Well, that’s you know? Just doin’ what needed to be done.
Pvt. Lorraine: Sounded like more than that. You saved nearly four hundred men.
Steve Rogers: Really, it’s not a big deal.
Pvt. Lorraine: Tell that to their wives. [Steve gets nervous as she walks up to him]
Steve Rogers: Uh…I don’t think they were all married.
Pvt. Lorraine: You’re a hero.
Steve Rogers: Well, that…you know? That…that depends on the definition of it really. [she grabs hold of his tie]
Pvt. Lorraine: The women of America, they owe you their thanks. And uh…seeing as they’re not here. [drags him to the corner of the office and kisses him]
Peggy Carter: [she walks in] Captain! [Steve and Pvt. Lorraine separate] We’re ready for you. If you’re not otherwise occupied. [annoyed, she turns and walks ahead]
Steve Rogers: Agent Carter, wait.
Peggy Carter: Looks like finding a partner wasn’t that hard after all.
Steve Rogers: Peggy, that’s not what you thought it was.
Peggy Carter: I don’t think anything, Captain. Not one thing. You always wanted to be soldier and now you are. Just like all the rest.
Steve Rogers: Well, what about you and Stark? How do I know you two haven’t been… fonduing?
Peggy Carter: [she turns to look at him] You still don’t know a bloody thing about women!
[In Stark’s lab]
Howard Stark: Fondue is just cheese and bread, my friend.
Steve Rogers: Really? I didn’t think…
Howard Stark: Nor should you, pal. The moment you think you know what’s goin’ on in a woman’s head, it’s the moment your goose is well and truly cooked. Me, I concentrate on work. Which at the moment is about making sure you and your men do not get killed. Carbon polymer. [referring to a piece of cloth lying on the table] Should withstand your average German bayonet. Although Hydra’s not going to attack you with a pocket knife. [referring to Steve’s Captain America shield] I hear you’re uh… kinda attached?
Steve Rogers: It’s handier than you might think.
Howard Stark: I took the liberty of coming up with some options. [shows him a few shields] This one’s fun. She’s been fitted with electrical relays. It’ll allow you to…
Steve Rogers: What about this one? [he picks up a round silver looking shield]
Howard Stark: No! No! That’s just a prototype.
Steve Rogers: What’s it made of?
Howard Stark: Vibranium. It’s stronger than steel and a third of the weight. It’s completely vibration absorbent.
Steve Rogers: How come it’s not a standard issue?
Howard Stark: That’s the rarest metal on earth. What you’re holding there? That’s all we’ve got.
Peggy Carter: [as Steve is checking out the shield made out of Vibranium] You quite finished, Mr. Stark? I’m sure the Captain has some unfinished business.
Steve Rogers: [holds up the Vibranium shield against him] What do you think? [Peggy picks up gun and shoots it at Steve as he quickly holds up the shield to protect himself]
Peggy Carter: Yes. I think it works. [she puts the gun down and walks out of the lab, Steve and Howard looking at her stunned]
Steve Rogers: I had some ideas about the uniform. [gives Stark a piece of paper]
Howard Stark: [takes it] Whatever you want, pal.
[Montage of Captain America and his Howling Commandos fighting Hydra.]
[At the site of a destroyed Hydra base]
Johann Schmidt: You are failing! We are close to an offensive network that will shake the planet. And yet we are continually delayed, because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield!
Dr. Arnim Zola: This is hardly my area of expertise. I…I merely develop the weapons. I…I cannot fire them.
Johann Schmidt: Finish your mission, Doctor. Before the American finishes his.
Guard: [two guards arrive with the facility manager] Sir!
Facility Manager: I’m sorry, Herr Schmidt. We fought to the last man.
Johann Schmidt: Evidently not. [kills him]
James Barnes: [On a snow covered mountain the Howling Commandos prepare to zipline onto the train.] Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I and I threw up?
James Barnes: This isn’t payback, is it?
Steve Rogers: Now why would I do that?
Gabe Jones: We were right. Dr. Zola’s on the train. Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle. Wherever he’s going, they must need him bad.
James Montgomery Falsworth: Let’s get going, because they’re moving like the devil.
Steve Rogers: We only got about a 10-second window. You miss that window, we’re bugs on a windshield.
James Montgomery Falsworth: Mind the gap.
Dum Dum Dugan: Better get moving, bugs!
Jacques Dernier: Maintenant! (Now!) [ Steve, Bucky and Gabe zippline onto the train.]
Dr. Arnim Zola: [watching Steve on a monitor, fighting his way through the train] Stop him! Fire again!
James Barnes: [after Steve helps him out] I had him on the ropes.
Steve Rogers: I know you did. [another trooper with a blaster appears] Get down!
Dr. Arnim Zola: Fire again! Kill him! Now!
Steve Rogers: [Bucky’s been blasted through a hole and is now hanging outside the train.] Bucky! Hang on! Grab my hand! NO!
[Allied HQ in London, Phillips brings a tray of food to Zola after he’s been captured and imprisoned]
Col. Chester Phillips: Sit down.
Dr. Arnim Zola: What is this?
Col. Chester Phillips: Steak.
Dr. Arnim Zola: What is in it?
Col. Chester Phillips: Cow. Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is to get ahold of a prime cut like that out here?
Dr. Arnim Zola: I don’t eat meat.
Col. Chester Phillips: Why not?
Dr. Arnim Zola: It disagrees with me.
Col. Chester Phillips: How about cyanide? Does that give you the rumbly tummy too? Every Hydra agent that we’ve tried to take alive has crunched a little pill before we can stop him. But not you. So, here’s my brilliant theory. [Phillips starts eating the steak.] You wanna live.
Dr. Arnim Zola: You’re trying to intimidate me, Colonel.
Col. Chester Phillips: I bought you dinner. [passes him a piece of paper which Zola reads out loud]
Dr. Arnim Zola: ‘Given the variable information he has provided, and in exchange for his full cooperation, Dr. Zola is being remanded to Switzerland.’
Col. Chester Phillips: I sent that message to Washington this morning. Of course it was encoded. You guys haven’t broken those codes, have you? That would be awkward.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Schmidt will know this is a lie.
Col. Chester Phillips: He’s gonna kill you anyway, Doc. You’re a liability. You know more about Schmidt than anyone. And the last guy you cost us was Captain Rogers’ closest friend. So, I wouldn’t count on the very best of protection. There’s you or Schmidt. It’s just the hand you’ve been dealt.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Schmidt believes he walks in the foot steps of the Gods.
Col. Chester Phillips: Mmm.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Only the world itself will satisfy him.
Col. Chester Phillips: You do realize that’s nuts, don’t you?
Dr. Arnim Zola: But the sanity of the plan is of no consequence.
Col. Chester Phillips: And why is that?
Dr. Arnim Zola: Because he can do it!
Col. Chester Phillips: What’s his target?
Dr. Arnim Zola: His target… is everywhere.
[Hydra main base, Schmidt addresses his soldier]
Johann Schmidt: Tomorrow, Hydra will stand master of the world. Born to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie. Our enemies weapons will be powerless against us. If they shoot down one plane, hundreds more will rain fire upon them! If they cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Hail Hydra! [his soldiers all start saluting and shouting ‘Hail Hydra’]
[In London, a part of the city destroyed by bombs, formerly the bar where Steve enlisted the Howling Commandos. Peggy follows the voice of a radio through the rubble.]
Man on the Radio: Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area. Please wait for the all-clear. Your attention, please. All citizens shall remain indoors until further notice. Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area.
Steve Rogers: [when Peggy finds him he’s pouring himself some drink] Dr. Erskine said that… the serum wouldn’t just effect my muscles, it would effect my cells. Create a protective system of regeneration and healing. Which means um…I can’t get drunk. Did you know that?
Peggy Carter: Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person. He thought it could be one of the side effects. [referring to Barnes getting killed] It wasn’t your fault.
Steve Rogers: Did you read the reports?
Peggy Carter: Yes.
Steve Rogers: Then you know that’s not true.
Peggy Carter: You did everything you could. Did you believe in your friend? Did you respect him? [Steve looks at her as if to say yes] Then stop blaming yourself. Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice. He damn well must have thought you were worth it.
Steve Rogers: I’m goin’ after Schmidt. I’m not gonna stop till all of Hydra is dead or captured.
Peggy Carter: You won’t be alone.
[The team prepare a battle plan to take down Red Skull at his headquarters]
Col. Chester Phillips: Johann Schmidt belongs in a bug house. He thinks he’s a God. He’s willing to blow up half the world to prove it, starting with the USA.
Howard Stark: Schmidt’s working with powers beyond our capabilities. He gets across the Atlantic, he will wipe out the entire eastern sea board in an hour.
Gabe Jones: How much time we got?
Col. Chester Phillips: According to my new best friend, under twenty four hours.
Jaques Dernier: Where is he now?
Col. Chester Phillips: Hydra’s last base is here. [holding a photo he points to the base] In the Alps. Five hundred feet below the surface.
Jim Morita: So, what are we supposed to do. I mean, it’s not like we can just knock on the front door.
Steve Rogers: Why not? That’s exactly what we’re gonna do.
[after Steve has been captured by Hydra soldiers and brought to Schmidt’s weapon lab]
Johann Schmidt: Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait, but I must say you do it better than anyone. But there are limits to what even you can do, Captain. Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?
Steve Rogers: He told me you were insane.
Johann Schmidt: Ah. He resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine. But he gave you everything. So, what made you so special?
Steve Rogers: Nothin’. I’m just a kid from Brooklyn. [after Schmidt has beaten him] I can do this all day.
Johann Schmidt: Oh, of course you can. Of course. But unfortunately I am on a tight schedule. [Schmidt takes out his cube-energy pistol and points it at Steve]
Steve Rogers: So am I! [just then Steve’s team crashes through the windows of the weapons lab]
James Montgomery Falsworth: Rogers! You might need this! [He throws Steve his shield.]
Steve Rogers: Thanks! [Steve makes his way through the Hydra base which has fallen into chaos with the arrival of more Allied soldiers.]
Jim Morita: [into his comm] We’re in! Assault team, go!
Col. Chester Phillips: [standing outside listening to Morita] Move out! [the soldiers start running towards the Hydra base] Keep your spacing!
[In the Hydra base]
Hydra Soldier: Cutt off one head, two more shall… [he’s killed by Phillips]
Col. Chester Phillips: Let’s go find two more!
[As Steve chases Schmidt he is confronted by a Hydra soldier with flame throwers and saved by Peggy]
Steve Rogers: [after Peggy has killed the Hydra soldier] You’re late.
Peggy Carter: Weren’t you about to…
Steve Rogers: Right. [Steve continues his chase, but after Schmidt has boarded the Valkyrie Steve is not fast enough to catch the plane. Behin him Phillips and Peggy appear in a car and pick him up to chase the plane on the runway.] Keep it steady! [Just as Steve is about to leap from the roadster onto Schmidt’s plane Peggy stops him]
Peggy Carter: Wait! [she kisses him] Go get him. [Steve surprised by the kiss looks at Phillips]
Col. Chester Phillips: I’m not kissin’ you!
[Inside the Valkyrie there are multiple figher planes with their targets written on them: Boston, Chicago, New York. After Steve has managed to disable the fighter planes and their pilots he enters the cockpit where Schmidt is waiting.]
Johann Schmidt: You don’t give up, do you?
Steve Rogers: Nope! [They fight]
Johan Schmidt: You could have the power of the gods! Yet you wear a flag on your chest and think you fight a battle of nations! I have seen the future, Captain! There are no flags!
Steve Rogers: Not my future! [He flings his shield at Schmidt who is thrown into the cubic console.]
Johan Schmidt/Red Skull: What have you done? No. [he picks up the cube and energy starts to pour from it, revealing a window into space. A stream of blue energy engulfes Schmidt and takes him into the sky. The cube falls to the ground and burns through it until it falls into the sea below.]
[Steve takes over the plane’s controls, on a screen he reads "Ziel New York City" (target New York City), and tries the radio which is picked up by the Hydra control tower occupied by Peggy, Phillips and Morita.]
Steve Rogers: Come in. This is Captain Rogers. Do you read me?
Jim Morita: Captain Rogers, what is your… [Peggy takes his place]
Peggy Carter: Steve, is that you? Are you alright?
Steve Rogers: Peggy! Schmidt’s dead.
Peggy Carter: What about the plane?
Steve Rogers: That’s a little bit tougher to explain.
Peggy Carter: Give me your coordinates, I’ll find you a safe landing site.
Steve Rogers: There’s not going to be a safe landing. But I can try and force it down.
Peggy Carter: I’ll get Howard on the line, he’ll know what to do.
Steve Rogers: There’s not enough time. This thing’s moving too fast and it’s heading for New York. [referring to Schmidt’s plane, speaking through the plane’s control] I gotta put her in the water.
Peggy Carter: Please, don’t do this. We have time. We can work it out.
Steve Rogers: Right now I’m in the middle of nowhere. If I wait any longer a lot of people are gonna die. Peggy, this is my choice. [as he’s forcing the plane down towards the water] Peggy?
Peggy Carter: I’m here.
Steve Rogers: I’m gonna need a rain check on that dance.
Peggy Carter: [with tears in her eyes] Alright. A week, next Saturday, at the Stork Club.
Steve Rogers: You got it.
Peggy Carter: Eight o’clock on the dot. Don’t you dare be late. Understood?
Steve Rogers: You know, I still don’t know how to dance.
Peggy Carter: I’ll show you how. Just be there.
Steve Rogers: We’ll have the band play somethin’ slow. I’d hate to step on your… [the line goes static and Peggy begins to cry]
Peggy Carter: Steve? Steve? Steve?
[Later, the world celebrates the victory over Nazi-Germany. The Howling Commandos are in a bar.]
James Montgomery Falsworth: To the Captain. [They drink]
[Stark on his search for the Valkyrie in the arctic sea on a ship. They’ve found the Tesseract.]
Stark’s Engineer: Sir? [Stark steps to him and watches on a screen how a submarine grabs the cube.]
Howard Stark: [to the captain] Take us to the next grid point.
Stark’s Engineer: But there’s not trace of wreckage. And the energy signature stops here.
Howard Stark: Just keep looking.
[After Steve has been missing for some time, we see him awaken in a 1940’s hospital and he can hear a baseball game on an old radio when a woman walks into the room]
Dodgers Announcer: [over the radio] Curve ball, high and outside for ball one. So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4. And the crowd well knows that with one swing of his bat, this fellow’s capable of making it a brand-new game again. Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets Field. The Phillies have managed to tie up at 4-4. But the Dodgers have three men on. Pearson beaned Reiser in Philadelphia last month. Wouldn’t the youngster like a hit here to return the favour? Pete leans in. Here’s the pitch. Swung on. A line to the right. And it gets past Rizzo. Three runs will score. Reiser heads to third. Durocher’s going to wave him in. Here comes the relay, but they won’t get him. [the door opens and an agent walks in]
SHIELD Agent: Good morning. [she checks her watch] Or should I say, afternoon?
Steve Rogers: Where am I?
SHIELD Agent: You’re in a recovery room in New York city.
Dodgers Announcer: The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4. Oh, Dodgers! Everyone is on their feet. What a game we have here today, folks. What a game indeed.
Steve Rogers: [he looks at her suspiciously] Where am I really?
SHIELD Agent: I’m afraid I don’t understand.
Steve Rogers: The game, it’s from May, nineteen forty one. I know, cause I was there. [he gets up from the bed] Now, I’m gonna ask you again. Where am I?
SHIELD Agent: Captain Rogers… [she secretly pushes an alarm]
Steve Rogers: Who are you? [two soldiers in black uniform enter the room and Steve knocks them through the wall. Steve realizes that he’s on a some kind of made up set and he runs out of there.]
SHIELD Agent: Captain Rogers, wait! [into a comm] All agents, code 13! I repeat. All agents, code 13!
[Steve finds himself in 2011’s Time Square he looks around him in shock, numerous SUV’s encircle him and Fury steps out of one of the vehicles]
Nick Fury: At ease, soldier! Look, I’m sorry about that little show back there, but… we thought it best to break it to you slowly.
Steve Rogers: Break what?
Nick Fury: You’ve been asleep, Cap. For almost seventy years. [Steve looks around him in shock] You gonna be okay?
Steve Rogers: Yeah. Yeah. I just…I had a date.
[lines after end of credits; Steve’s is pummeling a punching bag in a gym and in anger knocks it off it’s chain, sending it flying across the room when Fury enters the gym]
Nick Fury: Trouble sleeping?
Steve Rogers: You’re here with a mission, sir?
Nick Fury: I am.
Steve Rogers: Trying to get me back in the world?
Nick Fury: Trying to save it.
[End of Captain America: The First Avenger][Marvel Studios Opening Sequence begins but instead of seeing our heroes, We see Our Watcher Informant Stan "The Man" Lee and his cameos. In the end of the intro, a white text appears reading "Thank You Stan".]

[Early morning, Vers has woken up from a dream and is now standing outside Yon-Rogg's room. When she knocks, Yon-Roog answers the door still half-asleep]

Yon-Rogg [annoyed and tired]: Do you know what time it is?

Vers: Can't sleep.

Yon-Rogg: There are tabs for that.

Vers: Yeah, but then I'd be sleeping.

Yon-Rogg: Dreams again?

(Vers nods in response. Yon-Rogg does so as well.)

Vers: Wanna fight?

[Scene changes to Vers falling over. The camera then pans to show a doji-like structure, with Vers and Yon-Rogg on a mat]

Vers: I slipped.

Yon-Rogg: Right. You slipped as a result of me punching you in the face.

Vers: I was already slipping when you happened to punch me in the face. The two events are not related.

Yon-Rogg [amused]: Tell me about this dream.

[Vers and Yon-Rogg start to spar]

Yon-Rogg: Anything new?

Vers: No.

[Vers and Yon-Rogg continue to spar. Yon-Rogg grabs Vers' right arm and pins it behind her]

Yon-Rogg: You've got to let go of your past.

CVers: I don't remember my past.

Yon-Rogg: It's causing you doubt, and doubt makes you vulnerable.

[Yon-Rogg lets go of Vers' arm and they continue to spar. Vers then is forced onto the floor, and her fist begins to glow orange]

Yon-Rogg: Control it.

[Vers' fist returns to normal]

Yon-Rogg: Lose control again and you'll have to convene with the Supreme Intelligence. There is nothing more dangerous to a warrior than emotion.

[Vers smirks at Yon-Rogg causing Yon-Rogg to push her backwards]

Yon-Rogg: Humor is a distraction. And anger? Anger only serves the enemy.

[Yon-Rogg continue to fight. Yon-Rogg puches Vers in the face causing her to fall down. Vers retaliates by shooting energy from her fist, resulting in Yon-Rogg flying backwards]

[Scene changes to outside of a futuristic train station. There are electronic billboards on buildings, and blue and orange lights can be seen through windows]

Electronic Voice-Over (from billboard): 120 days since the last Skrull attack.

[The scene then changes to Vers and Yon-Rogg inside of a train carrage, surrounded by other Kree]

Vers: Has anybody seen what the Supreme Intelligence really looks like?

Yon-Rogg: No-one can look upon the Supreme Intelligence in its true form. You know that. Our subconscious chooses the way they appear to us. So it's sacred, it's personal. The Kree divulges it ever.

Vers: Who do you see? Your brother?

Yon-Rogg: No.

Vers: Father?

Yon-Rogg (annoyed): No

Vers: Your old commander?

Yon-Rogg: Vers...

Vers: (smug): It's me you see, isn't it?

Yon-Rogg (amused): I see what you're trying to do.

Vers: (laughing): Is it working?

Yon-Rogg: Yes. But you won't succeed in changing my mind on the subject.

Vers: What is the point of giving me these [gestures to her hands] if you don't want me to use them?

Yon-Rogg: You're going to use them. The Supreme Intelligence made me the responsibility of showing you how to use them.

Vers: I know how.

Yon-Rogg: Well if that were true, you'd knock me down without them.

[Carol pulls a face then punches Yon-Rogg in his arm]

Yon-Rogg: Control your impulses. Stop using this [points to her chest, above her heart] and start using this [gestures towards her head]. I need you to be the best version of yourself.

[Scene changes to the inside of the Supreme Intelligence. The walls appear golden, with pillars wider towards the top and narrowing towards the bottom. The floor has a hexagon lit up with white light. Vers walks onto the hexagon and extends her arms beside her. Tentacle-like wires appear from below her feet and connect to her legs, arms, and head.]

[The scene changes again, but the wires have disappeared and the walls have been replaced with an endless glossy floor. Lights then descend from above and the Supreme Intelligence appears from within them.]

Supreme Intelligence: Vers.

Vers: Intelligence.

Supreme Intelligence: Your commander insists that you're fit to serve.

Vers: I am.

Supreme Intelligence: You struggle with your emotions, with your past which fuels them.

[A floating image of the Earth appears, which Vers turns to look at. The image then turns into a variety of planets, with the camera switching slowly between them.]

Supreme Intelligence: You are just one victim of the Skrull expansion that has threatened our civilisation for centuries. Imposters who silently infiltrate then take over our planets.

[The image then zooms into one of the planets, revealing a Skrull carrying a weapon similar to in Vers' dream.]

Supreme Intelligence: Horrors which you remember and so much which you do not.

Vers: It's all... blank. My life. You're supposed to take the form of you I most admire but I don't even remember who this person was to me.

Supreme Intelligence: Perhaps this is a mercy, sparing you from a deeper pain. Freeing you to do what all Kree must. Put your people's needs before your own. We've given you a great gift, a chance to fight for the good of all Kree.

[The chip on Vers' neck begins to blink, almost simultaneously her hands begin to glow.]

Vers: I want to serve.

Supreme Intelligence: Then master yourself; what was given can be taken away.

[Vers' chip and her hand stop glowing]

Vers: I won't let you down.

Supreme Intelligence: We'll know soon enough. You have a mission. Serve well and with honor.

[The scene suddenly changes back to inside the Supreme Intelligence building and the wires slide back to underneath Vers' feet.]

[The scene changes to a shot of Vers, and Yon-Rogg's team walking towards a space ship within a hanger. The hanger is large, the walls are golden, and the team is wearing a green and black uniform.]

Att-Lass: This can't be good.

Korath: It must be another Skrull attack.

Bron-Char: Whatever it is, it's big.

Minn-Erva: Has a Skrull ever simmed you?

Korath: Once. It was deeply disturbing.

Vers: Why?

Korath: Because I stared into the face of my mortal enemy and the face staring back was my own.

Vers: Well maybe if you were more attractive then it would be less disturbing.

Korath: You think you're funny, but I'm not laughing.

Att-Lass: You never laugh.

Korath: I laugh on the inside. I'm not doing it now.

Bron-Char: It's funny cause objectively speaking, you're quite handsome.

Korath: Well thank you.

Yon-Rogg: Listen up team! Knock it off (pointing at Carol).

[Yon-Rogg walks into the center of the plane and begins presenting a holographic presentation.]

Yon-Rogg: Alright, prepare for a search and rescue of our spy, Soh-Larr. The Skrulls have invaded yet another border planet, this time Torfa. Soh-Larr sent a warning signal, which we've intercepted, that his cover's blown. The Skrull General Talos has sent kill units to find him. Should they reach him before we do, the intelligence he has acquired over three years is as good as theirs. The accusors will bomb a Skrull stronghold here in the south. We slip in, we locate Soh-Larr and we get out, leaving them none the wiser. The Torfa populace; we are not to interfere with them nor them with us. Nothing compromises the security of our mission. Proceed with caution. Follow protocol before extracting him.

[The holograph disappears, leaving the team standing in a circle.]

Yon-Rogg: This is a dangerous mission, we must all be ready to join the collective if that is our fate today. For the good of all Kree!

Vers, Bron-Char, Korath, Minn-Erva and Att-Lass: For the good of all Kree!

[The scene changes to show the ship and the Accusor's ships flying out of the hanger and towards the horizon towards a jump hole. Once they all pass through the jump hole, the scene changes to show the ships leaving the hole, surrounded by empty space and approaching the planet Torfa.]

[The Accusor's ships begin firing missiles down towards the Skrull stronghold down on Torfa. The ship containing Vers, Yon-Rogg and the other Kree follows after the missiles and crash lands in the sea. Carol and the Kree then emerge from the ship wearing masks and their green and black uniform. The Kree then swim from their ship before removing their masks.]

Yon-Rogg: Vers, track Soh-Larr's beacon. Att-Lass and Minn-Erva find elevation.

[The camera follows the Kree sneaking towards the stronghold, amongst pillars of rock and mountains.]

Minn-Erva: Locals on the periphery. Maybe a dozen.

[Static noise is heard coming from Yon-Rogg's earwig]

Yon-Rogg: Minn-Erva?

Minn-Erva: Do you read me? Anybody copy?

[Static noise is heard coming from Yon-Rogg's earwig.]

Yon-Rogg: Repeat.

Vers: His beacon's coming from that temple. Let's move.

Yon-Rogg: No. This is the perfect spot for an ambush. Only one way in, only one way out.

Bron-Char: And we have to pass the locals.

Yon-Rogg: We don't know if they are locals. Too risky.

Vers: You don't have to go with me. I'll go alone.

Yon-Rogg: No! You won't.

[Yon-Rogg looks around, assessing his surroundings.]

Yon-Rogg: Right. Keep a close radius, we lose comms we meet back at the Helion. Come on.

[The scene then changes to show the thermal imaging through one of the Kree's guns, showing the locals moving towards an area.]

Minn-Erva: Att-Lass, you getting this?

Att-Lass: Copy. I see them.

[The scene changes to the Kree walking amongst pillars of rock towards the local's campsite.]

Locals: {Untranslated syllables}

Yon-Rogg: Get back!

Bron-Char: Commander!

Yon-Rogg: Get back. Back!

Locals: [commotion amongst the group]

Yon-Rogg: Minn-Erva, do you have eyes on this?

[The Kree draw their weapons and face the locals.]

Yon-Rogg: (to the locals) Get back! Minn-Erva!

Minn-Erva: Does anybody copy?

Locals: {untranslated syllables} [commotion amongst the group]

Yon-Rogg: I don't want to hurt you. Get back! Stay back!

[The scene changes to the view through Minn-Erva's gun. The locals continue to move towards the Kree, and Minn-Erva prepares to shoot before Att-Lass lowers her gun.]

Att-Lass: They're locals. I found two dead, no green. They're just starving.

[Minn-Erva sees Att-Lass fighting against the locals through the scope of her gun. The Skrull disguised as Att-Lass begins to fight Minn-Erva, before Minn-Erva shoots him in the chest]

[The scene changes to Vers trying to locate Soh-Larr in the temple. When she sees somebody, the tablet in her arm lights up showing a string of characters.]

Vers: HGX-78

Soh-Larr: TRT79-VVX6

[The scene changes back to Yon-Rogg and Bron-Char surrounded by the locals]

Locals: {untranslated shouting}

Bron-Char: Get back!

[One of the locals draws a Skrull weapon before being shot by Minn-Erva. Minn-Erva continues to shoot the locals surrounding Yon-Rogg and Bron-Char]

Yon-Rogg: Skrulls!

[The scene changes back to Vers and Soh-Larr, with Soh-Larr sitting exhausted against a rock.]

Yon-Rogg (through Vers' earpiece): Vers? Skrulls! It's an ambush.

[Soh-Larr shocks Vers with a Skrull weapon, paralyzing her.]

[The locals begin screaming before transforming into Skrulls and drawing their weapon. They then charge towards Yon-Rogg and Bron-Char and begin a firefight.]

Yon-Rogg: Vers!

Bron-Char: Incoming!

Yon-Rogg: Back to the Helion!

[The scene changes back to Vers and Soh-Larr. Vers has just regained movement, however, Soh-Larr has transformed into Skrull General Talos.]

Yon-Rogg (through Vers' earpiece): Vers? Do you copy?

Vers: How did you know the code?

General Talos: How about I tell you my secret? When you tell me yours?

[General Talos tasers Vers before the screen turns black.]

Skrull Tech (voiceover): Let's open her up.

[The scene changes to a flashback of Vers at an Airforce base. The camera is pointed towards the nose of a plane and the hangar door is opening. The angle changes to follow Vers walking towards a fighter plane.]

General Talos (voiceover): Where are we?

Skrull Scientist (voiceover): Stand by.

[The angle widens to show a circle of planes sitting on the tarmac.]

Maria: Where's your head at?

Vers: In the clouds. Where's yours?

Maria: On my shoulders. About to show these boys how to do it. You ready?

Vers: Higher, further, faster baby.

Maria: That's right.

[The scene changes to show Maria and Vers climbing into their cockpits and preparing to fly.]

General Talos (voiceover): This can't be right.

[The scene then changes to show Vers and Monica's planes taking off, before switching to a shot of Vers flying.]

General Talos (voiceover): Go back even further.

[The camera spins to change from a scene of Vers flying to a scene of 11-year old Vers driving around a go-kart track at a fair.]

Boy: You're going too fast. You need to go slow.

[Vers speeds up but crashes into the hay outlining the track. As the car tumbles, Vers sees flashes of orange and blue light similar to that of her energy blasts.]

General Talos (voiceover): Who is this person? Are we in the right...?

Joseph Danvers: What the hell are you thinking? You don't belong out here!

Skrull Scientist (voiveover): I think we went back too far.

Vers (11-years old): You let him drive.

Skrull Scientist (voiceover): Let me try something.

[The scene changes again to show Vers hanging onto a rope to complete a ropes course in Air-Force training. She stares at the rope in front of her.]

Cadets: You don't belong out here! You're not strong enough! You'll kill yourself!

[Vers swings back on the rope, before jumping off and trying to grab the rope in front of her. She grabs it, however, she loses grip and falls to the ground. When she hits the ground, there is an image of her thrown backward because of blue and orange flames, before the image returns to her hitting the ground on the course. The cadets laugh behind her]

Drill Instructor: They'll never let you fly.

General Talos (voiceover): Am I the only one who's confused here?

[The scene changes again to the inside of a bar, with Vers sitting at a table with Maria and another pilot standing next to her]

Pilot: You're a decent pilot, but you're too emotional. You do know why they call it a cockpit, don't you?

[The camera changes to show a pool table. When a ball hits the table, the image changes to a small flash of blue light before changing back to the table]

[The camera then shows Vers' brother and Vers at six lying in the grass]

Vers' Brother: Huge rumble throughout the cosmos shook the moon and the sun and the stars in the sky. And so, little Alouette flew up throughout the night.

Vers (6-years-old): Did you see her? (referring to a shooting star which just passed by) It's Alouette.

[The scene changes again to show a Vers and Maria's daughter lying in the grass outside Maria's house]

Maria: Get your butt's inside, it's time to eat.

Carol: Prepare for takeoff Lieutenant Trouble.

General Talos (voiceover): Charming memory.

Skrull Scientist (voiceover): Hang on. I think I got it.

[The scene changes to show Vers leaning against her car outside of an airplane hanger, with Goose walking towards her. Vers leans down to pet Goose before Dr. Wendy Lawson walks towards her]

Wendy Lawson: Goose likes you. She doesn't typically take to people.

Vers: Early start to your morning.

Wendy Lawson: Ah. Late night actually, I can't sleep when there's work to do. Sound familiar?

Vers: Flying airplanes never feels like work.

[Wendy and Vers turn to look at the airplanes which are taking off and landing]

Wendy Lawson: Wonderful view isn't it?

Vers: I prefer the view from up there.

Wendy Lawson: You'll get there soon enough Ace.

[Wendy Lawson turns around and walks away]

General Talos (voiceover): Wait, wait, wait. That's her. Get her back.

Skrull Scientist (voiceover): Stand by.

Wendy Lawson: Sound familiar?

[Vers turns around to see Wendy standing behind her]

Wendy Lawson: Wonderful view isn't it?

Vers: I prefer the view from up there.

Wendy Lawson: You'll get there soon enough...

[Wendy Lawson turns around and walks away]

General Talos (voiceover): What's that on her shirt? I couldn't read it.

Wendy Lawson: Sound familiar?

[Vers turns around to see Wendy standing behind her]

Wendy Lawson: Wonderful view isn't it?

Vers: I prefer the view from up there.

Wendy Lawson: You'll get there soon enough...

General Talos (voiceover): Focus.

Vers: Excuse me?

[Wendy Lawson talks, however her voice is drowned out by General Talos' voiceover]

General Talos (voiceover): Look down.

[The camera pans down to the nametag on Wendy Lawson's shirt]

General Talos (voiceover): Focus. Pegasus, Dr. Wendy Lawson. That's her.

Carol: Can you hear that?

General Talos (voiceover): Do we have the location?

[The camera shows Vers continuing to talk, but a flash of blue lighting interrupts the scene, before returning to Vers talking to Wendy]

Skrull Tech (voiceover): Got it.

General Talos (voiceover): Now track Lawson until we find the energy signature.

[The scene changes back to Vers' dream, where Lawson is holding a gun towards an unknown person]

General Talos (voiceover): Interesting.

[Vers' dream sequence continues through General Talos' voiceovers]

General Talos (voiceover): Huh. Hold on. Go back right before this. Go back.

[Once General Talos fires his weapon, the scene changes to Vers in a dogfight. General Talos continues to talk to Vers, but Vers is beginning to resist]

Carol: That's no MIG, Lawson.

General Talos (voiceover): This is it. Now, let me see where you're headed. That's right, look at the coordinates. (Vers begins having flashbacks to directly after the explosion) Focus. (Vers shuts here eyes) Open, please. That's it. That's it. (Vers begins looking at the coordinates, but her vision is fuzzy)You're almost there.You're almost there. (Vers shuts her eyes, squeezing them shut) Don't fight it. (Vers visions about the explosion come back, this time focusing on the fire around the plane) Focus!

[Carol ejects herself from the plane, descends down to Earth, and shuts her eyes]

General Talos (voiceover): Get her back. Get her back now!

[When Versopens her eyes, the scene suddenly changes to Vers with electricity running from a machine to her temples. Her vision is blurring, but shadows of upside-down Skrulls can be seen. As Vers looks around, the camera shows her restrained and hanging upside-down inside of a Skrull warship]

Skrull Scientist: This doesn't make any sense.

General Talos: Do we have any information we can act on?

Skrull Scientist: Just that Lawson was somewhere on the Planet C53. We're on our way.

General Talos: Then dig, dig, dig, deeper. Lawson is our link to that lightspeed engine! And everything we're after...

[A Skrull taps Vers in the center of her forehead, which changes an image on a screen]

General Talos: Oh. That did something. Try that again.

[The Skrull taps Vers on the forehead twice, before noticing that Vers' metal restraints are beginning to glow orange]

Skrull: Oh-uh.

[Vers begins free from the restraints and begins to fight the Skrulls, one of the Skrulls raises their weapon, but General Talos lowers it]

General Talos: Not yet!

[Vers fights the Skrulls in the room, before confronting Talos. Vers pushes Talos against a table, and holds a glowing orange restraint against his head]

Vers: What did you do to me?

General Talos: We're just after a little information.

Vers: What did you put in my head?

General Talos: Nothing that wasn't already there.

Vers: But those aren't my memories.

General Talos: Yeah, its like a bad trip in there. I'm not surprised you can't keep it straight. They really did a number on you.

Vers: Enough of your mind games! What do you want?

General Talos: We're looking for the location of a Doctor Lawson and her light speed engine.

Vers: I don't know any Doctor Lawson.

General Talos: Then why is she in your head?

[Skrulls begin running into the room from all different corridors. Vers throws General Talos against them before running off barefooted. Vers then runs around the ship, trying to find an exit, while fighting of the Skrulls, before she is stuck between two parties of advancing Skrulls]

Vers: You wouldn't know how these things come off would ya? No? Fine.

[Vers begins fighting the Skrulls, with her hands still in the restraints. Once she has defeated the Skrulls, she runs off again before being confronted by General Talos and two others. She presses the pad to open the door with her bare foot. During this fight, she manages to free herself from the restraints by blasting energy from her hands until they break. However, this causes the glass of the ship to crack and Vers to be pulled outside. She then uses the energy in her hands to fly inside towards the room where she was held captive]

Vers: Hey!

[The Skrulls working at the computers put their hands up in surrender, but Vers just picks up her shoes before fighting a Skrull for an escape pod, attracting the attention of Talos]

Talos: Leaving so soon? We're just getting to know each other.

[Vers blasts a wave of energy towards Talos' head, which he ducks underneath. Vers continues starting the pod and flys down to Earth. On the flight down, the pod begins to break, and Vers is forced out and is thrown down into a Blockbuster store]

[The scene changes to the inside of an empty Blockbuster store. The lights are on and hanging at angles, the shelves are half-empty and Vers is covered in material from the roof. Vers stands up slowly and turns in a circle, taking in her surroundings. When she turns around and sees a life-size poster, she shoots an energy blast towards it, causing the head to fall off and the neck to erupt in flames]

Vers: Vers to Star Force Command. Do you read me?

[Vers begins to walk through an aisle, looking at the movies on the shelf]

Vers: Hello? Do you copy?

[Vers stops, picks up a movie and reads the summary. She becomes intrigued with something outside, and walks towards it. The scene then changes to a shopping strip, outside of the Blockbuster. Vers wipes dust off of her shoulders before walking towards a car and knocking on its window]

Vers: Hi, I'm Vers. Kree Star Force. Is this C-53? Do you understand me? Is my universal translator working?

Security Officer: Yeah, I understand you.

Vers: Oh, good. Are you in charge of security for this district?

Security Officer: Sort of. The movie theatre has its own guy.

Vers: Where can I find communications equipment?

[The security officer points towards Radio Shack]

Vers: Thank you.

[The scene changes to a shot of Skrulls walking towards the beach from within the waves. They look around, trying to find a person to imitate. General Talos finds a young women surfing, and changes into her]

General Talos: Track the pod, find the girl. She knows more than she knows.

[The scene changes to show that the three Skrulls have also changed into surfers from the beach, however Talos and another are identical]

General Talos: Hey, this one's taken.

[The scene changes back to the shopping strip, now in daylight. Vers is tinkering with her communications equipment with parts from Radio Shack and a payphone. She turns on her communicator and calls Yon-Rogg. The camera switches between Vers at the shopping strip and Yon-Rogg on the ship]

Vers: Come on.

Yon-Rogg: Vers. Verify, CTC39.

Vers: GRX31600, and I'm fine thank you for asking. Is everyone ok, what happened?

Yon-Rogg: Skrull ambush. I thought we'd lost you. Did you find Soh-Larr?

Vers: It wasn't Soh-Larr. Talos simmed him, even knew his code.

Yon-Rogg: That's impossible. That code was buried in his unconscious.

Vers: The Skrulls messed with my mind. The machine that they used, I think it was how they extracted Soh-Larr's code.

Yon-Rogg: Vers, where are you?

Vers: I'm on planet C-53. The Skrulls are looking for someone named Lawson.

Yon-Rogg: Who?

Vers: She's... who I see...

Yon-Rogg: She's what? Vers. Vers, what?

Vers: She's a scientist. They think that she's cracked the code on light speed tech. I have to get to her before they do, or else they'll be able to invade new galaxies.

Yon-Rogg: No. You've been caught once already. How far to C-53?

Bron-Char: Closest jump point is 22 hours.

Yon-Rogg: Vers. Hold your position until we get there, keep your comms online so that we can contact you.

Vers: No! What if they get a hold of it before...

[The payphone disconnects. The camera shows Yon-Rogg on the ship]

Yon-Rogg: Vers? Vers!

Korath: If the Skrulls have got to her, she's compromised.

Yon-Rogg: She's stronger than you think.

Bron-Char: Have you visited C-53?

Minn-Erva: Once, it's a real shithole.

[Camera switches back to Vers standing in the phone booth. Police cars speed down the road behind her before turning and parking outside the Blockbuster store. Phill Coulson and Nick Fury step out of an unmarked police car. Coulson walks towards the security car, while Fury begins to examine the store]

Coulson: You call this in?

[The security guard nods before pointing at Vers. Vers is then seen activating her beacon, while Nick Fury walks up behind her and taps on the glass surrounding the phone booth]

Fury: Excuse me miss, do you know anything about a lady who went through the roof of that Blockbuster over there? Witness says she was dressed for laser tag.

Vers: Oh. Yeah, I think she went that way.

[Vers tries to walk off, but Fury steps in front of her]

Fury: Ah. I'd like to ask you some questions. Maybe give you the 4-1-1 on late night drop-bys. Could I see some identification, please?

Vers: Vers. Kree Star Force. We don't carry identification on metal cards.

[Vers tries to walk off again, and Fury stops her]

Fury: Vers. Star Force. How long are you planning on being in town?

Vers: Oh, I'll be out of your hair as soon as I track down the Skrulls which are infiltrating your planet.

Fury: Skrulls?

Vers: Shape-shifters. They can transform into any lifeform down to the DNA. Oh boy, you guys don't have a clue do you?

Fury: Oh, oh, oh, oh. Hold on. How do we know that you're not one of those... shapeshifters?

Vers: Congratulations Agent Fury. You have finally asked a relevant question.

Fury: Oh! Congratulations to you Star Force Lady. You're under arrest.

[A policewoman steps forward to arrest Vers, however, Vers sees one of the Skrulls from the beach on a nearby rooftop and shoots an energy blast at them. Vers then runs towards the building, and Fury grabs his gun and runs towards the car. The Skrull runs across the rooftop, jumping over pipes while Fury runs along the footpath at the front of the building. The Skrull runs up the stairs, towards a train and transforms into an old lady who exits the train in front of him. Carol jumps up to the platform and runs into the same old lady. Vers then chases the train down the platform and jumps on top of it. Fury sees Vers hanging onto the train and turns the car around to pursue it. Vers then walks through the train, observing all the passengers]

Stan Lee (1922-2018 R.I.P): [Reading the script for Mallrats] Trust me, true believer. Trust me-

[Vers lowers the script to see the the truest Avenger, who smiles at her. She smiles back, then she continues to looks for the Skrull.]

Stan Lee (1922-2018 R.I.P): [continuing his lines] Trust me, true believer.

[Vers keeps looking before seeing the old lady. Vers then punches her, causing a fight before being pulled off the lady by a group of passengers. The lady escapes before changing into one of the men and walking into the next carriage and jumping onto the roof. Vers follows the man onto the roof and continues to fight him. Fury's car continues to follow the train track, barely avoiding the carnage being thrown off the roof by Vers and the Skrull]

Coulson: Train's heading for a tunnel up ahead.

Fury: Let's greet them at the station.

Coulon (over comms): Fury, this is Agent Colson. Umm, I'm still here at the Blockbuster and where did everybody go? I've finished collecting evidence.

[The Skrull disguised as Coulson draws his weapon and points it towards Fury. They struggle for the gun before Fury turns the car into an oncoming bus, killing the Skrull]

[The scene changes to Vers alone outside of a building. She places a Skrull USB into the computer attached to her arm and looks through the file, containing information from her interrogation. The computer shows different images from her interrogation before it sparks and Vers removes the USB. The scene then changes to Vers inside of an internet Cafe, googling the information from the Skrull's. The scene changes again, this time to Vers standing outside of the Cafe holding a map. A biker comes along and parks next to where Vers is standing]

Biker: Nice scuba suit.

[The biker revs his engine, causing Vers to look towards him before looking back at her map]

Biker: Line up honey, heh? Got a smile for me?

[The biker then enters the shop. Vers then looks towards the bike again before taking some clothes from a nearby store and leaving on the bike]

[The scene then changes to the autopsy of the dead Skrull]

Medical Examiner: All life on Earth is carbon-based, not this guy. Whatever he runs on, it's not on the periodic table.

Fury: You're saying he's not from around here?

Medical Examiner: Hey, how's your eye?

Fury: Well, I'd say fine. But it can't believe what it's seeing.

Director: You said, that this thing looked like Coulson?

Fury: Talked like him too.

Director: The woman said that there were more?

Fury: The word she used was infiltration.

Director: Belive her?

Fury: Not 'till I say this.

Director: What's your plan?

Fury: I got to find Blockbuster girl. I got word on a motorcycle thief which fits her description. She can tell us why these lizards are here, maybe she can tell us how to kick them to the curb.

Director: Good. Do it alone though. Can't trust anyone. Not even our own men.

Fury: Yes sir.

[Fury walks away, leaving the Director of SHIELD and the Medical Examiner with the dead Skrull]

Director: Wow, they're ugly bastards aren't they?

Medical Examiner: Yeah, well. They're not Brad Pitt sir.

[The Directors leans down until he's just above the dead Skrull]

Director (whispers): Safe journey to the beyond my friend. I will finish what we started.

Medical Examiner: I wouldn't get too close there boss.

Director: No-one in or out.

[The scene changes to Vers driving the motorcycle across the desert on an almost empty highway. She overtakes a car, then pulls into a parking lot outside of a bar before walking inside. Vers looks around, remembering the vision from the Skrull interrogation of her and Maria inside the bar. The camera pans to show visions of Vers playing an arcade game, drinking with Maria and singing karaoke. Vers then walks over to a wall covered in pictures of Air Force fighter jets, before fixating on one with the Pegasus logo on the tail. While Vers is looking at the photos, the bartender walks past her]

Bartender: What can I get ya?

Vers: Where was this photograph taken?

Bartender: At an airport?

Vers: Where's Pegasus?

Fury: That's classified. Not unlike the file I started on you.

[Vers then walks behind the bartender and into view. The bartender then walks away confused]

Fury: But I see you changed it up a bit since then. Grunge is a good look for you.

Vers:: Did you have a rough day Agent Fury?

Fury: It's cool. You know, space invasion, big car chase, got to watch an alien autopsy. Typical 9 to 5.

Vers: So you saw one?

Fury: I was never one to believe in aliens. But I can't unsee that.

Vers: This is gonna get a little awkward but I gotta ask.

Fury: You think I'm one of those green things.

Vers: Can't be too careful.

Fury: You are looking at 100 percent red-blooded Earthman.

Vers: I'm afraid I'm gonna need proof.

Fury: We talking cheek swab or urine sample.

Carol: No. The DNA would match.

Fury: Well my AOL password.

Vers: Skrulls can only assume recent memories of their host bodies.

Fury: Oh oh! You wanna get personal.

Vers: Where were you born?

Fury: Huntsville, Alabama. But technically I don't remember that part.

Vers:: Name of your first pet.

Fury: Mr. Snuffers.

Vers: Mr. Snuffers?

Fury: That's what I said. Did I pass?

Vers: Not yet. First job?

Fury: Soldier, straight out of high school. Got the ranks of full breed Colonel.

Vers: And then?

Fury: Spy.

Vers: Where?

Fury: It was the Cold War, we were everywhere. Uh... Belfast, Bucharest, Belgrade, Budapest.

Vers: Now?

Fury: Been riding a desk for the past few years, trying to figure out where our future enemies are coming from. Never occurred to me that they'd be coming from above.

Vers: Name a detail so bizarre a Skrull could never fabricate it.

Fury: If toast is cut diagonally, I can't eat it. You didn't need that did you?

Vers: No. No, I didn't. But I enjoyed it.

Fury: Ok. Your turn. Prove you're not a Skrull.

[Vers calmly blasts energy out of her fists towards a jukebox on the opposite side of the room before resting her head back on her fist. Fury continues to look towards the jukebox, both concerned and confused]

Fury: And how is that supposed to prove to me that your not a Skrull?

Vers: It's a photon blast.

Fury: And...?

Vers: A Skrull can't do that. So a full-bred colonel turned spy turned SHIELD agent must have pretty high-security clearance. Where's Pegasus?

[The scene changes to a black car driving through an empty highway next to a mountain, before changing to the inside of the car showing Fury driving and Vers in the passenger seat]

Fury: So the Skrulls are alien races which infiltrate and overtake alien planets. And you're a Kree, a race of noble warriors.

Vers: Heroes. Noble warrior heroes.

Fury: So um. What do Skrulls want with Dr. Lawson?

Vers: They believe she developed a light speed engine at Pegasus.

Fury: Light speed engine? I've got to admit, that's not the craziest thing I've heard today.

Vers: Well, it's still early.

Fury: And you, what do you want?

Vers: To stop the Skrulls before they become unstoppable.

Fury: And...? Look, war is a universal language. I know a rogue soldier when I see one, you've got a personal stake in this.

[The camera pans out to show the car arriving at a bunker. It then follows the car down the driveway and towards the security checkpoint]

Security Checkpoint: This is a government property, turn your vehicle around.

Fury: Nicholas Joseph Fury, Agent of SHIELD.

Security Checkpoint: Place your thumb on the pad. One moment.

Vers: Nicholas Joseph Fury, you have three names?

Fury: Everybody calls me Fury. Not Nicholas, not Joseph, not Nick. Just Fury.

Vers: What does your mom call you?

Fury: Fury.

Vers: What do you call her?

Fury: Fury.

Vers: What about your kids?

Fury: If I have them, they'll call me Fury.

Security Checkpoint: You're cleared for access.

Fury: Thank you.

[The gate in front of the bar opens and the car drives down the driveway and into a tunnel. The writing "Project Pegasus, Joint NASA USAF Facility" appear on the screen when the car enters the tunnel. Fury continues to drive through the tunnel before reaching the end and parking beside another car. Vers and himself step out of the car and shut the doors]

Fury: Oh, hold up. You look like somebody's disaffected niece. Put that on.

[Fury throws a grey baseball cap with SHIELD's logo at Carol]

Vers: What is this? [gesturing towards the logo]

Fury: It's the SHIELD logo.

Vers: Does announcing your identity on clothing help with the covert part of your job.

Fury: Said the space soldier who was wearing a rubber suit.

[Vers puts the cap on, and looks at Fury annoyed]

Fury: Lose the flannel.

[Vers takes off the flannel shirt hanging around her waist and throws it into the car. Vers and Fury then walk over to the edge of the carpark, showing an airplane hanger full of planes set up similar to that in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. A security guard from Pegasus and two armed airmen approach them from behind]

Security: How can I help you?

Fury: We're agents of SHIELD.

[Fury hands his badge to the security officer before looking at Fury]

Vers: We're looking for a woman named Lawson.

Fury: A Dr. Wendy Lawson.

Vers: Do you know her?

[The security officer hands back Fury's badge and directs them]

Security: Follow me.

Vers: Hmm.

[Vers and Fury follow the security officer but are directed towards a holding facility. The scene cuts to Vers and Fury sitting in an office, both incredibly bored. Fury is leaning forward, placing his elbows on his knees while Vers is leaning back against the wall with her arms crossed.]

Fury: Are you familiar with the phrase "Welcome Wagon"?

Vers: No.

Fury: Well, this ain't it.

[Fury then tries to leave the room by placing his thumb on a scanner near the door. The scanner looks at his fingerprint before blinking red. Fury then sighs before reaching into his pocket to grab his pager]

Vers: Is that a communicator?

[Fury stands up, walk across the room and begins typing on his pager]

Fury: Yeah. State-of-the-art two-way pager.

Vers: Who are you paging?

Fury: My mom. Don't worry, I didn't mention you.

[The text on the pager reads "DETAINED WITH TARGET. NEED BACKUP"]

[Vers stands up and walks towards the door and tries opening it with her fingerprint, before walking across the room to look at a map of the facility. At the same time, Fury then takes out his badge and looks at it carefully under the lights. He takes a piece of sticky tape, presses it against his badge before walking across the room and placing it on the scanner. When Fury begins walking across the room, Vers sits on the desk and watches him. The scanner reads the fingerprint before glowing green and opening the door]

Fury: After you.

Vers: Impressive.

Fury: Oh. You should see what I can do with a paperclip.

[Vers and Fury walk out of the room. The camera then skips, showing them leaving an elevator on the level holding records. As they are walking towards the records room, Goose walks up to Fury and Vers causing Fury to fawn over the cat]

Fury: Hey, there. How are you?

[Fury leans down to pet Goose but Vers stands back, observing the cat with a sense of deja vu]

Fury: Oh my goodness. Look at you. Just look at you. Aren't you the cutest little thing.

[Fury continues to fawn over the cat, even picking up Goose but Vers continues walking through the corridor looking for the records. Vers eventually finds the room before turning around and watching Fury with disinterest]

Fury: Aren't you cute? And what's your name, huh? What's your name? "Goose", cool name for a cool cat.

Vers: Fury.

[Both Fury and Goose turn to look at Vers. Vers nods towards the door]

Fury: (to Goose): I'll be back.

[Fury walks away from Goose and stands next to Vers outside a door labeled "Records"]

Fury: Oh. Let me get my fingerprint out. Just let me unravel this puppy.

[While Fury is unwrapping the piece of sticky tape, Vers shoots energy out of her fist causing the handle and lock to disappear]

Fury: You sat there and watched me play with tape? When all you had to do was... [Fury imitates Vers shooting the energy]

Vers: I didn't want to steal your thunder.

[Vers and Fury walk into the records room. The room is originally dark, but the lights turn on row by row revealing a massive warehouse of shelves full of boxes. Vers and Fury walk past a few aisles before stopping and turning into one. Vers looks at all the boxes carefully before finding the one she wants]

Vers: Huh. Lawson.

[Vers pulls two boxes off the shelf. She hands the first to Fury and then places the second on the floor before removing files. Randomly, Goose appears at the end of the aisle]

Vers: Ha. Lawson's plan for the light-speed engine. I wonder why they terminated the project.

Fury: Um, maybe because she's cuckoo.

[Fury shows Vers a page from a notebook, covered in hieroglyphics which Vers instantly recognizes]

Vers: Kree glyphs?

Fury: Hmm?

Vers: Lawson is not cuckoo. She's Kree.

Fury: Well, she's dead.

Vers: What?

Fury: She crashed the ASIS aircraft during an unauthorized test flight. Took a pilot down with her. That's why security here's so unfriendly. They're covering up a billion dollar mistake. Oh, and your light-speed engine is toast.

[Fury shows Vers a black and white photograph of a site of the plane crash. The image is a satellite photo of a flat beach next to a mountain, however, the beach has a track leading up to a circle caused by an explosion. Vers turns over the next photo, showing the beach from eye level; the sand was pushed up into large ridges by the explosion]

Vers: When did this crash happen?

Fury: Six years ago. 1989.

Vers: Who was the pilot?

Fury: Um, most of this thing's redacted but there is a testimonial here from a Maria Rambeau. Last person to see them both alive.

[Fury's pager begins to buzz]

Fury: You OK?

Vers: Mm-hmm.

Fury: Back in a minute.

[Once Fury's gone, Vers reaches into the pile of file's in Fury's box and reads the testimonial and crash report. While she is flipping through the file, she stops at an image of Dr. Lawson, Maria, a pilot and herself in the background]

[A flashback then starts. A fighter jet suddenly takes off from a tarmac. Dr. Lawson speaks to Vers and Maria while the two pilots admire the plane]

Lawson: This isn't about fighting wars. It's about ending them.

[The flashback continues, with Vers attempting to land the new plane but crashing through trees before abruptly finishing]

[The scene then cuts to Vers on the phone with Yon-Rogg]

Vers: I know Lawson was Kree. She was here on C-53 and died in a plane crash. Do you know anything about this?

Yon-Rogg: I just discovered a mission report sent from C-53. There's only so much I'm cleared to tell you Vers, but... [looks to see no one is looking] Lawson was an undercover Kree operative named Mar-Vell. She was working on a unique energy core. Experimenting with tech that apparently could help us win the war.

[Scene suddenly changes to show four or five black sedans racing through the entrance tunnel before abruptly pulling up. The director of SHIELD then steps out of the passenger side door of the first car]

Director: Still here?

Fury: She's co-operating with the investigation sir.

Director: You men stay here.

[The director points towards the men in the other cars before himself and Fury walk towards the elevators]

Director: I want to question her alone. Excellent work Nicholas.

[As the Director and Fury step inside the elevator, Fury turns around and looks at the director with a questioning look before the doors close in front of them. The scene then changes back to Vers and Yon-Rogg on the phone]

Vers: Does it say anything about me?

Yon-Rogg: Anything about you? No, of course not. Why would it?

Vers: I found evidence that I had a life here.

Yon-Rogg: On C-53?

Vers: Mar-Vell is who I see in the Supreme Intelligence. I knew her. And I knew her as Lawson.

Yon-Rogg: This sounds like Skrull simulation Vers.

Vers: No its not! 'Cause I remember I was here!

Yon-Rogg: Stop! Remember your training. Know your enemy. It could be you. Do not let your emotions undermine your judgment.

[Scene changes back to the elevator with Fury and the Director]

Fury: She's on sub-level 6. I'll get off on 5, take the stairs in case she runs for it. Do a pincer move, like we did in Havana.

Director: Right. Like we did in Havana.

[The elevator buzzes and the doors open. Fury steps off and walks away while the Director stays in the elevator. The scene changes back to Vers and Yon-Rogg]

Yon-Rogg: We're nearing the jump-point. Leave your beacon on so I can find you. We'll get to the bottom of this Vers. Together.

Vers: Ok.

[Vers then hangs up the phone. The scene then changes to show the Director stepping off the elevator on an abandoned level, probably a boiler room. The director looks around confused before the scene changes to show Fury walking through an aisle of cabinets]

Fury: Vers!... Vers!

[The lights turn on at the end of the corrdior, showing a SWAT-like team following the director. Fury quickly jumps into a random aisle. The SWAT team then search through every aisle looking for either Fury or Vers. As this is happening, Vers is seen walking down the stairs towards sub-level 6 with Coulson and another agent on the flight of stairs above her]

Agent: Fury's colluding with the target.

Coulson: Then why did he call us in?

Agent: All I know is that we take him in too. Dead or alive.

Coulson: Dead or alive?

[Vers, standing directly underneath them hears this conversation and, after a moment of contemplation, decides to turn back around and walk up the stairs to find Fury. Fury is then seen hiding at the end of an aisle of cupboards, peeking his head around one side before throwing an empty can across the room. The lights suddenly turn on and a team of agents runs towards the can. Fury then walks through the aisle, before peering his head around. However, when Fury does this, the director points a gun at his head]

Director: Is it something I said?

[Fury hits the gun away from his head, leading to a long struggle between the two men with the Director being victorious]

Director: Now you know, I don't really need these to see (holding up his glasses which were knocked off during the fight). But, they do kinda complete the look (the Director's voice suddenly changes into the voice of Skrull General Talos). Don't you think?

[During this monologue, the Director advances towards Fury, who is lying on his back in defeat. However, an energy blast suddenly appears blasting straight into his chest and sending him flying backward. Several teams of agents suddenly appear standing near the Director, with their guns drawn. But the camera tilts to show a hole burnt through the roof, and Vers and Fury running along a corridor on the level above]

Vers: You called them in?

Fury: My bad!

[Vers and Fury turn a corner, and they are suddenly running up a flight of stairs however, Coulson is standing direclty above them with his gun drawn. Vers' hand lights up but Coulson lowers his weapon before letting both of them walk through the door behind them]

Agent: Coulson, you have eyes on them?

Coulson: They're not down here. Let's try up there.

[Vers and Fury then sprint out of the corridor before barricading the door behind them with a piece of metal. Vers then holds out her hand, expecting Fury to give her something. When he doesn't, she hits him and holds her hand out again]

Fury: What?

Vers: Your communicator. You obviously can't be trusted with it.

[Fury hands over his pager, as the agents slam into the door behind them. The agents are heard struggling, but Vers and Fury run over towards cover. The agents eventually push through, but Vers and Fury are already hidden behind a tower of boxes. Vers then observes her surroundings, looking for a way out before hitting Fury and gesturing towards a plane, which has a striking resemblance to a Star Wars ship. The agents continue to search, even walking past were Vers and Fury were hiding, but the duo are already in the cockpit]

Fury: Do you know how to fly this thing?

Vers: Uh... we'll see.

Fury: That's a yes or no question.

[Vers purposefully plays with a few switches, causing the engine to roar to life and the wings to extend]

Vers: Yes.

[The Director hears the engine come to life and turns around to see the plane alive. Vers then pushes a lever forward and causes the plane to lift]

Fury: That's what I'm talking about!

[The Director and the agents shoot meaninglessly at the plane, but the plane continues to lift off and fly normally. Vers flies the plane out of the underground tarmac area, and over the open desert before the plane begins gaining altitude quickly. Suddenly, a meowing sound can be heard from the back of the plane. Both Vers and Fury turn to see Goose pushed against a crate]

Fury: We've got a stowaway.

Vers: Hang on Goose.

[Vers then stops the plane from gaining altitude and Goose pushes himself off the crate, onto his four legs. Goose then happily walks up to the cockpit before trying to climb into Vers' lap. Vers pick him up and places him on the console before Goose lies down]

Fury: Who's a good kitty huh? Huh Goose? Yes, that's right. Who's a good kitty Goose? You're a good kitty.

[Goose responds to Fury by lying down comfortably and staring at him]

Vers: See anyone you know? Funny story... I arrived on Hala, near dead, no memory... That was six years ago.

Fury: So you think you're the pilot that went down with Dr Lawson.

Vers: I'm saying that the last person to see them alive can probably tell us.

Fury: Maria Rambeau.

Carol: Mmhmm. So how do we get to Louisianna?

Fury: Due East. Hang a right at Memphis.

Vers: That agent, that stopped the Skrulls from fighting us...

Fury: Coulson. New guy. Guess he doesn't hate me yet.

Vers: Yeah well, give him time.

Fury: I guess he had a feeling, went with his gut against orders. It's a really hard thing to do. That's what keeps us human.

Vers: I get in trouble for that. A lot.

Fury: I see that about you (Vers and Fury laugh about this). Rescuing the guy how sold you out to the Skrulls. I guess that's not standard Kree operating procedure.

Vers: Well, I won't tell your boss if you don't tell mine.

[The scene then changes to the Kree ship approaching a jump-point. Yon-Rogg is seen walking towards the holograph, which is later shown the be Ronan the Accusor]

Yon-Rogg: Ronan.

Ronan: The Accusors have completed their operation but the greater mission was a failure thanks to your team.

Yon-Rogg: It was a trap. To lure our operative Vers to talk for her kidnapper.

Ronan: Give us the location, we'll take care of the terrorist threat.

Yon-Rogg: By bombing them out of the galaxy. No. We'll handle this.

Ronan: Several Skrulls anywhere is a threat to Kree everywhere. Where are they?

Korath: They are...

Yon-Rogg: Lost. They are lost, for now. But we will find them.

Ronan: Do so, or we will.

[Ronan disappear, leaving only Yon-Rogg and Korath]

Yon-Rogg: Maintain the course for C-53.

[The scene changes to show a traditional suburban house behind a forest of trees. On closer inspection, Maria Rambo is tinkering on a workstation beside a small two-seater plane. Vers approaches Maria carefully, almost unsure of what to say or do. Once Vers speaks, Monica Rambeau quickly exits the plane she was exploring]

Vers: Excuse me, I'm looking for Maria Rambeau.

Monica: Aunty Carol? Mom, it's Aunty Carol! I knew it, everybody said you were dead but we knew they were lying.

[Monica jumps off the plane and runs to Vers to hug her. Vers stands awkwardly, unaware of how the child is]

Vers: I'm not really who you think I am.

[The scene changes to the inside of the house. Maria and Monica are sitting at a small dining table, Vers is leaning against the counter and Fury is leaning against the wall]

Maria: That is the craziest shit I have ever heard.

Monica: Green-transforming aliens? There's no such thing.

Fury: You're absolutely right, young lady. There is no such thing. 'Cause if there were, we would want to keep that to ourselves. (Fury looks towards Vers accusingly)

Vers: You don't believe me.

[Vers stand up and walks towards the stove, where a pot of unboiled water sits on the stove. She stands next to the stove, with one hand on the kettle and begins heating it up, her hand glowing blue and orange. When this starts, Monica stands up, both fascinated and curious, and walks over to the stove. Quickly, the kettle begins to boil, blowing steam out and making a whistling noise]

Monica: No way. That's so cool.

Fury: Oh, ho. She can do a lot more than just make tea with those hands.

Monica: Like what? Show us.

'Vers:' Maybe later.

Monica: I kept all your stuff, I'll go get it.

Vers (to Fury): You want to give her a hand with that?

Fury: Mmm??

[Fury then follows Monica off-screen, leaving Vers alone with Maria, who hasn't said a word since the incident with the kettle. Vers walks from behind the counter and sits opposite Maria at the table]

Maria: You don't remember anything?

Vers: I see... flashes. Little moments, but I can't tell what's real. If I could just piece together what happened that morning, maybe it'll all make sense?

Maria: You woke me up, banging on my door at dawn. Your usual move. Back then we had to get up so early, the Air Force still wasn't letting women fly combat, so testing Lawson's planes was our only shot at doing something that mattered. And you wanted to race to base, in your old Mustang, and I wasn't about to argue, 'cause I knew my Camaro would dominate. But you cheated, took a shortcut.

Vers: Since when is a shortcut cheating?

Maria: Since it violates the pre-determined rules of engagement.

Vers: I definitely don't remember those.

Maria: Mmm, of course you don't. (both Maria and Vers laugh for a bit) When I got to the hanger, Lawson was agitated, she said 'she had lives to save'. She was trying to take the Aces up herself, but you said...

Vers: 'If there were lives at stake, I would fly the plane.'

Maria: Yup. Big hero moment. The kind of moment we've both been waiting for. The Doc was always unique. That's why I liked her. But, now you're saying she's from another planet.

Vers: I know this must be hard for you.

Maria: What, this part right here? No, no. Know what's hard? Losing my best friend, in a mission so secret they act like it never even happened. Hard... is knowing you were out there somewhere, too damn stubborn to die. And now you come up in here after 6 years... with your super-charged fire-hands and you expect me to call you... I don't even know what... 'Vers'? Is that really who you are now?

Vers: I don't know.

Monica: Come look.

[Monica has brought a box of Vers' things onto the dining table in an adjacent room. Fury looks through a few photos before putting them back and stepping away from the table. Vers walks into the room and stands behind Monica, who is showing her a photo]

Monica: This is me and you on Halloween.

[Monica shows Vers a photo of a young Monica dressed as a pilot sitting next to Vers]

Monica: I'm Amelia Earhart and you're Janis Joplin. Oh, this is you when you were little, you didn't get along with your parents so Mom said we became your real family.

[Monica shows Vers a photo of a young Vers standing next to her father]

Monica: This is us on Christmas. I got more...

[Monica shows Vers photo after photo, starting with Monica, Vers and Maria sitting in front of a Christmas tree, then a photo of young Vers dressed as a pilot, then a photo of Vers sitting in a bar]

Monica: Here's another picture of when you were little. And this is how you right after you graduated... (Monica continues to talk, but the words start to mix together).

[The camera pans over all the photos which Monica has shown and is showing to Vers. In addition to the other photos, there is one of her Air Force graduation, one of her squadron standing in front of a plane, one of her and Monica carving a pumpkin and another of Vers dressed as Janis Joplin]

Monica: Oh wait. I forgot, your jacket. Mom doesn't let me wear it anymore after I spilled ketchup on it.

[Monica runs off to retrieve Vers' jacket. Once Monica has left, Vers looks at the pictures again, pushing them around to better see ones underneath. Vers continues looking through the pictures before she comes across her old dog tag, which has been burnt]

Maria: That was all that survived the crash. Or so we thought.

[The door knocks, and Maria moves forward to answer the door]

Vers: Don't answer that.

Maria: It's just my neighbor.

Vers: They can change into anyone.

[Fury and Vers walk towards the door and try to see who is outside. Vers answers the door and stares unfriendly at Maria's neighbor, Tom]

Tom: Hi there.

Vers: What do you want?

Tom: Ummm...

Maria: Hey Tom. This is my friend Carol.

Tom: Pleased to meet you. Yow! Static electricity out here's no joke. I noted that peculiar bird you got parked by the road, and I was just wondering if you'd mind if I bring the boys over to get a closer looksie?

Vers: A closer looksie?

Tom: Yeah.

Vers: To see the bird parked out by the road. You're really working overtime to sell this one, aren't you Talos?

Maria: I'm sorry. Tom, this isn't really a good time. I'll come by tomorrow? Okay?

Tom: Uhh...

Maria: Okay.

[Maria closes the door, but Vers continues to stare at Tom. Once Maria has closed the door, a voice is heard behind them. Fury draws his weapon and aims it towards the voice, Vers' hands light up and Maria stands there confused]

Talos: You know, you really should be kinder to your neighbors. You never know when you're gonna need to borrow some sugar.

[Talos takes a sip of the milkshake he is holding while Carol begins to advance towards him, her hands glowing more now]

Talos: Now, hang on a second, before you go swinging those jazz hands around, making a mess in your friend's house - and... it's a lovely home.

Maria: Oh my God. What the hell?!

[Maria is staring out the window, looking at herself playing with Monica]

Talos: No one's gonna hurt the girl. Just, don't kill me. That would really complicate the situation.

Fury: I'm about five seconds from complicating that wall with some ugly-ass Skrull brains.

Talos: I'm sorry I simmed your boss. But now I stand before you as my true self. Without deception.

Vers: And who is that, out there?

Talos: Okay, that's a fair point. But I'm sure that you understand, I had to take some precautions. I saw you crush 20 of my best men with your hands bound. I just wanna talk.

Vers: Last time we talked, I ended up hanging from my ankles.

Talos: That was before I knew who you were. Before I found what made you different from the others. I have an audio recording from Pegasus, of your voice, from a plane crash six years ago. On a device I believe you call a 'black box'.

Maria: They told me it was destroyed in the crash. How'd you get it?

Talos: Does she not understand? Young lady I have a special skill that kinda allows me to get into places I'm not supposed to be.

Maria: Call me young lady again, and I'm gonna put my foot in a place it's not supposed to be.

Talos: Am I supposed to guess where that is?

Fury and Maria: Your ass.

Talos: Okay, I get it. We're all a little on edge here. But look, I just need your help decoding some coordinates. If you sit down, you listen to this, I assure you, it'll be worth your while.

Carol: Call your buddy back inside and I'll listen.

Talos: Deal.

[Goose walks onto the scene and begins pressing himself against Talos' legs. Talos, surprised jumps backwards]

Talos: Oh my God! Get that thing away! How'd that get in here?

[Vers picks up Goose, and holds him out towards Talos. Carol walks towards Talos, with her arms still extended, causing Talos to walk backwards]

Vers: The cat? This isn't what you're afraid of, is it?

Talos: That's not a cat. That's a Flerken.

Fury: A Flerken? (Fury laughs)

[Monica walks into the house and sees Maria standing next to Carol and Fury. She looks around and sees the Skrull assuming its true form]

Monica: Mom?

[The scene changes to the outside of a barn, with Monica sitting outside on the bench and Maria trying to stop her from coming inside]

Monica: Why can't I listen to?

[Monica puts earplugs in her ears and Maria walks inside, revealing a study. Vers, Fury, and Talos are already inside, waiting for Maria to play the tape. Maria puts the CD in the computer tower and the computer begins loading the tape. A loading bar appears on the screen, with the bar moving slowly across the screen]

Vers: What's happening?

Fury: It's loading.

[The camera cuts back to the screen, with the tape almost loaded]

Lawson (audio): Punch in the coordinates. 5229, -47, 8.768, 0.2.

Vers (audio): Copy that. Where are we going Doc?

Lawson (audio): My laboratory.

Vers (audio): Your laboratory? What do you mean?

Lawson (audio): Oh no.

Vers (audio): Is that... Wait, what is that? It's not showing up on my radar.

Lawson (audio): Go Carol. Fly!

[Scene changes to a flashback of the inside the airplane, with Vers in the cockpit and Lawson directly behind her. Outside the window, Earth can be seen with other planes flying around it]

Vers: That's no MIG, Lawson. Who the hell are they?

Lawson: Those are the bad guys. Fly faster, now.

Vers: Yes, ma'am. (Vers pushes a lever forward, causing the plane to speed up. The plane following them als also speeds up to catch them. The dogfight between the two planes continue, with Vers pushing the lever sideways in an effort to escape the other plane) What do they want?

Lawson: Me. My work. I never should have brought you along.

Vers: Here come some G's. (Vers pulls the lever backwards, causing the plane to flip in the air. After the flip, Vers and Lawson are trailing the other plane. However, when Vers fires the other plane fires back). They're firing backward. Hold on! (Vers pushes the lever sideways and the plane tilts into another revolution. However, the plane is hit and the wing bursts into flames. Vers struggles to regain control of the plane, but fails to do so]

Vers: Bail out! Bail out! Bail out! Stay with me Lawson! (Vers ejects the cockpit from the plane, and struggles to regain control. Once Vers has aligned the plane parallel to the ground, the plane crashes into a beach)

Maria: Danvers, do you copy?

Vers: Yeah, I copy. We hit ground.

Maria: Can anyone hear me?

Vers: Yeah. I copy! Doc?

[Vers climbs out of the plane and attends to Lawson, whose head is slumped against her chest. Once Vers removes Lawson's helmet, she notices something is wrong]

Vers: Your blood... it's blue.

Lawson: Yeah, but, uh...how's my hair? Help me out.

[Vers unbuckles Lawson's seatbelt and helps her out of the plane]

Lawson: I have to destroy it before they get here.

[Vers helps Lawson walk a few steps away from the plane before Lawson falls over. Vers leans over Lawson and tries to help her stand up, but Lawson refuses]

Vers: What? Lawson?

Lawson: You remember what I said about our work here? What it's for?

'Vers:' To end wars?

Lawson: Yeah. But the wars are bigger than you know. Damn it! My name is not Lawson. My real name, is Mar-Vell and I come from a planet called Hala.

Vers: I would say that your delusional but we just got shot down by a spaceship and your blood is blue.

Lawson: Listen, I spent half my life fighting a shameful war. Now skedaddle before you give me any more regrets. Just remember the coordinates, okay? You've got to save them without me.

Vers: Save who? How?

[Lawson ignores Vers' questions and pulls a gun out of her jacket]

Lawson: I've got to blow this engine before they find it.

[Lawson sits up and attempts to shoot the plane, but she is shot through the heart by an attacker from the other ship. Vers watches Lawson fall and sits there in shot watching the assailant. Suddenly, Vers reaches for Lawson's gun and points in the direction of the attacker. Vers switches between looking at Lawson lying on the ground and the direction of the attacker. Eventually, Yon-Rogg appears walking towards Vers and Lawson. Vers, with her gun drawn, slowly walks towards the plane]

Yon-Rogg: We have no interest in hurting you.

Vers: No?! Because all the shooting kinda gave me the wrong impression!

Yon-Rogg: The energy core, where is it?

Vers: Pararescue's on the way. You have two minutes until you're surrounded.

Yon-Rogg: Then I see no reason to prolong this conversation.

[Yon-Rogg draws his gun and points it towards Vers]

Vers: No wait. (Vers gestures towards the engine of the plane) You mean that energy core?

[Both Vers and Yon-Rogg look at the engine of the plane. Vers then turns her weapon towards the engine and fires. Immediately, the engine bursts into blue and orange flames, causing Vers and Yon-Rogg to be thrown backward. Vers absorbs the energy, with the flames creating ripples around her. All around the crash site, rocks are turned into dust and trees disintigrate. Vers continues to absorb the energy, her hands begin to spark and her eyes glow bright blue. Shortly afterwards, the blast suddenly stops and Carol is thrown backward onto the ground, with her body still sparking. Yon-Rogg struggles to stand up, and watches Vers from his seated position. Yon-Rogg's team heard the noise and have suddenly appeared]

Minn-Erva: Commander, she's still moving. Permission to fire?

Yon-Rogg: Hold your fire.

[Yon-Rogg walks up to the still-sparking Vers]

Minn-Erva: There's nothing left. The core has been destroyed.

[Yon-Rogg continues looking at Vers, but notices a part of her dog-tag sitting in the dirt. He picks it up and sees "Vers" inscribed on it]

Yon-Rogg: She absorbed its power. She's coming with us.

[The scene suddenly changes back into the present day, outside of the study. Vers is walking outside, confused]

Vers: He lied to me.

[Maria, Fury, and Talos follow her outside slowly]

Vers: Everything that I knew was a lie.

Talos: Now you understand.

Vers: What? What do I understand now?

Talos: Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell. He killed her. Because she found out that she was on the wrong side of an unjust war.

Vers: No. Your people are terrorists... that kill innocents. I saw the ruins on Torfa.

Talos: Ruins that the Accusers are responsible for. My people lived as refugees on Torfa. Homeless, ever since we resisted Kree rule and they destroyed our planet. Now the handful of us that are left, will be slaughtered next...unless you will help me finish what Mar-Vell started. The coordinates you found, would've powered a lightspeed ship capable of carrying us to safety. A new home, where the Kree can't reach us.

Maria: Lawson always told us that her work at Pegasus wasn't to fight wars, but to end them.

Talos: She wanted you to help us find the core.

Vers: Well, I already destroyed it.

Talos: No, you destroyed the engine. The core that powered it is in a remote location. If you help us decode those coordinates, we can find it.

Vers: You'll use it to destroy us.

Talos: We just want a home. You and I lost everything at the hands of the Kree. Can't you see it now? You're not one of them.

Vers: You don't know me. You have no idea who I am. I don't even know who I am!

Maria: You are Carol Danvers. You are the woman on that black box risking her life to do the right thing. My best friend... who supported me as a mother, and a pilot when no one else did. You're smart and funny, and a huge pain in the ass. And you are the most powerful person I knew, way before you could shoot fire from your fist. You hear me? You hear me?

[The scene changes back to the inside of the barn, with Talos, a Skrull scientist, Fury, Carol and Maria standing around a table]

Talos: I know I don't deserve your trust but you were our only lead. We discovered that your energy signature matched Mar-Vell's core. Now, we know why. If only you knew, the importance of it to me. I just need your help decoding the coordinates to Mar-Vell's lab.

Carol: Those weren't coordinates. They're safe vectors.

Fury: Orbital positioning and velocity.

Maria: You didn't find her lab on Earth, because it's not on Earth.

Carol: That was the location on the day of the crash six years ago. If we track its course, we'll find it, in orbit, right now.

Maria: It's just basic physics.

Talos: In orbit? Was that so difficult to figure out? I mean, you're my science guy, right?

[The Skrull scientists nods then looks down briefly, disappointed in himself]

Carol: Yon-Rogg will catch up to you soon. We've got to get the core before he does.

Fury (while eating a sandwich): Mmm. You're going to space?

Carol: In what?

Skrull Scientist: A few tweaks to your vessel should do it. I can handle the modifications.

Fury: Hmm. Your science guy.

[The scene changes to the inside of the hanger, with Talos and the Skrull scientist modifying the plane which Carol and Fury flew. The scene then changes back to the inside of the house, with Carol and Maria sitting opposite each other at a table]

Carol: Well, I could use a co-pilot.

Maria: No. No, I... I can't. I can't leave Monica.

Monica: Why? It's okay. I can stay with grandma and pop-pop.

Maria: There's no way I'm going baby. It's too dangerous.

Monica: Testing brand new aerospace tech is dangerous. Didn't you used to do that?

[Carol looks at Maria, smiling smuggly]

Maria: Your plan is to leave the atmosphere in a craft not designed for the journey, and you anticipate hostile encounters with a technologically superior foreign enemy. Correct?

[Carol smiles and shrugs her shoulders.]

Monica: That's what I'm saying. You have to go.

Maria: Monica...

Monica: You have the chance to fly the coolest mission in the history of missions. And you're gonna give it up to sit on the couch and watch Fresh Prince with me? I just think that you should consider the kind of example you're setting for your daughter.

[Maria looks towards Carol for help, but Carol is laughing at Maria's position. Carol then gives Monica a thumbs up]

[The scene then changes to the outside of the house, with Maria walking towards a car, with her parents inside. Monica sits on the front step watching the encounter. Carol then walks outside with her Kree suit on and sits beside Monica]

Carol: Your Mom's lucky. When they were handing out kids, they gave her the toughest one. Lieutenant Trouble.

Monica: You remember.

Carol: Is that mine? (Carol looks at the jacket sitting in Monica's lap. However, Carol protests when Monica attempts to hand it over). No, no. You hang onto it until I come back. But there is something that I need your help with. I can't wear these Kree colors anymore, and since you're obviously the only person around here with any sense of style...

[Carol stands up and presses a few buttons on her suit. Carol holds her arm out to Monica, allowing her to change the colors. She replaces the green with bright red and the yellow replacing the grey stripes]

Monica: No.

[Monica presses the buttons again. This time, the suit changes to orange, blue and yellow]

Monica: Uh-uh.

[Monica presses the buttons again. This time, the suit changes to black with neon lights lining the stripes]

Monica: Definitely not. (Both Carol and Monica laugh)

[Monica changes the color again, this time to a white suit with green stripes]

Carol: Well, since we're on the same team...

[Carol gestures to Monica's red, yellow and blue shirt. Monica then changes the colors to match her shirt. Carol's suit changes to a blue suit with yellow stripes and red gloves, boots, belt and shoulders]

Carol: How do I look?

Monica: Fresh.

[The scene then changes to a path surrounded by grass. Almost immediately, Yon-Rogg steps onto the path and walks down it. He walks down the path and into a small house in the middle of the forest. Carol, in her Kree colors, is already standing inside and watches him enter]

Carol: What took you so long?

Yon-Rogg: I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

Carol: PRY46-B...

Yon-Rogg: No, no codes. That system is fallible, as we've learned.

Carol: Okay, then let's do this.

Yon-Rogg: Who do I see when I commune with the Supreme Intelligence?

Carol: The person you most admire and respect, I guess. But you would never tell me who.

Yon-Rogg: And what is your earliest memory of Hala?

Carol: The transfusion. Blue blood running through my veins.

Yon-Rogg: Whose blood?

Carol: (Carol looks sideways, confused and stumbed) Hmm.

[Yon-Rogg shoots Carol, causing her to fly backward. Yon-Rogg then walks up to her and points his gun at her face]

Yon-Rogg: That's my blood that's coursing through her veins.

[Carol suddenly turns into a Skrull]

Yon-Rogg: What have you done with her?

Skrull: You're too late.

[Yon-Rogg begins walking away before stopping and turning around]

Yon-Rogg: She knows?

[Before the Skrull can answer, Yon-Rogg shoots him. He puts his gun back in its holster before calling Ronan with the hologram in his arm]

Yon-Rogg: Ronan, Skrulls have infiltrated C-53. Come at once.

Ronan: For the good of all Kree, Commander the infestation will be eradicated.

[The scene changes to the modified spaceship flying above the clouds before cutting to show Carol and Maria flying. The camera pans out to show Fury petting Goose and Talos looking at him uncomfortably]

Carol: Passing 500 and climbing.

Talos: You know, you really shouldn't have that thing on your lap.

Fury: Our little alliance with you is tenuous at best. And as long as he continues to freak you out (Fury picks up Goose and shoves him towards Talos' face. Talos jerks backward in his seat) like that, yeah I'm gonna keep giving him all the love and hugs he needs, right?

Maria: Can I ask you something? Do you just turn into anything you want?

Talos: Ah well, I have to see it first.

Maria: Can you all do it?

Talos: Physiologically, yeah. But it takes practice and, um, dare I say it, talent to do it well.

Fury: Can you turn into a cat?

Talos: What's a cat?

Maria: What about a filing cabinet?

Talos: Why would I turn into a filing cabinet?

Fury: A venus fly trap. I'll give you $50 right now if you turn into a venus fly trap.

(Talos sighs, annoyed at Fury's jokes)

Carol: Switching engines from Scramjet to fusion. Buckle up, folks.

[Carol pushes down a lever, causing the plane to suddenly climb further into the sky. In the plane, everybody is pushed back into their seats]

Fury: Hey. Is this normal, like space turbulence?

Carol: Pretty much.

[Carol smiles at Fury's question, while Talos just looks towards him and shakes his head. The plane continues to fly directly upwards, inside the plane everything begins floating. Carol and Maria's hair begins floating along with a few pens from the console between their seats. Similarly, Goose is floating upside down until Fury extends his arm, which Goose eagerly grabs onto. Maria then flicks a switch and gravity suddenly turns on inside the plane, and everything returns to normal]

Carol: Locking in coordinate grid.

Maria: Where is it?

[The view switches to the outside of the ship, showing the ship sitting in empty space with Earth below it]

Talos: It's here. It's gotta be here.

Fury: Well, is it in front of all that nothing, or behind it?

[Carol realizes something and pulls out the computer in her arm. After a few swipes, the computer lights up]

Computer: Decloaking activated.

[Suddenly, a bright light appears from the empty space and a massive laboratory becomes visible. The title "Mar-Vell's Laboratory, Kree Imperial Cruiser" appears on the screen. Carol flies the spaceship into the laboratory and the four disembark the plane and begin walking through the corridors]

[The four walk into a giant room, with the Tesseract sitting in the reactor on one side of the room. Goose jumps onto the reactor and scratches the Tesseract, intrigued by the bright light. Carol and Maria follow behind him]

Maria: Is that it? The core?

Carol: In her notes, she called it the Tesseract.

[Carol reaches out and grabs the Tesseract from its position in the reactor. She then throws it in the air like a baseball and walks around the room, beginning to observe her surroundings]

Maria: Whoa. What was Lawson doing with all this kid stuff?

[Maria picks up and lunchbox and opens it. Carol then places the Tesseract inside before closing the box. Fury then coughs and gestures towards a cup of tea, which is still steaming]

Maria: We're not alone.

[Talos begins singing loudly. Suddenly, a swarm of scared Skrulls appear from their hiding places. Suddenly a Skrull runs towards Talos and hugs himi]

Soren: Talos!

Carol: He didn't come here for the Tesseract.

[Soren calls a child to come towards her and Talos. The child comes willingly, and Talos leans down to get a better look at him]

Soren: It's okay. We didn't know what to do. Mar-Vell warned us not to send a signal for any reason or the Kree would find us.

Talos: You did the right thing.

[Once Soren noticed that Carol, Maria, and Fury are standing in the room, she tries to back away but Talos stops her]

Talos: It's okay, it's okay. She's alright. She's a friend.

Carol: I'm not gonna hurt you.

Talos: She led me to you.

Carol: I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

Talos: Carol, this is war. My hands are filthy from it too. But we're here now. You found my family. This is just the beginning. There's thousands of us separated from each other... scattered throughout the galaxy.

[Talos' daughter walks over to Carol, holds her hand and directs her towards the pinball machine in the corner. When they get there, the child points to the high score in glowing lights. The child jumps excitedly and asks her to play]

Fury: If I played the same pinball machine for six years I'd have some high scores too.

[Suddenly the doors to the lab open, and Yon-Rogg and his team walk through]

Yon-Rogg: Fraternizing with the enemy?

[Fury draws his gun but Minn-Erva already has hers pointed directly towards him. When she gestures for him to drop it, he raises his hands in surrender and returns the gun to its holster. Yon-Rogg walks towards Carol and throws Goose along the floor towards her. When the camera pans, Talos has positioned Soren behind her, Fury and Maria are both unarmed and the Kree's have surrounded the four]

Yon-Rogg: What did you do to your uniform?

Minn-Erva: They got in her head. Just like we thought.

Korath: The Supreme Intelligence will set her straight.

Talos: You can see they're not soldiers, let them go. You can have me.

Yon-Rogg: And the core?

Carol: You lied to me.

Yon-Rogg: I made you a better version of yourself. What's given can be taken away.

[Carol tries to light up her fists but they just spark uselessly before eventually dying out. The chip in her neck has also turned off. Instead of using her powers, Carol runs towards Yon-Rog and begins punching him. This results in a fist fight between the two. Quickly, Yon-Rogg lights up a gadget in his suit. The gadget glowed bright blue and caused Carol to lean back in an attempt to avoid it. Around her, the Kree are attacking the Skrulls, forcing them to kneel. Yon-Rogg then jerks his arm away from Carol, causing her to fall onto the ground]

[When Carol wakes up, the Supreme Intelligence machine is attached to her. She is kneeling with her hands bound in front of her. When Carol meets the Supreme Intelligence, a record is playing beside her and a long table is sitting in front of her, a few meters away with Dr. Lawson sitting at the only seat]

Supreme Intelligence: There she is. Seems like you time on C-53 jogged the old memory. This jacket? It's killer by the way.

[The Supreme Intelligence stands up and begins dancing to the music]

Supreme Intelligence: The music, it's a nice touch.

Carol: Let... me... out.

Supreme Intelligence: No can do.

Carol: If you hurt them, I will burn you to the ground.

Supreme Intelligence: With what exactly? Your powers came from us.

Carol: You didn't give me these powers. The blast did.

Supreme Intelligence: And yet, you've never had the strength to control them on your own.

[Carol tries to blast the Supreme Intelligence with her energy blast, but when she tries the Supreme Intelligence snaps her fingers and the energy dissapears, replaced with searing pain in Carol's neck which causes Carol to double over in pain]

[The scene switches back to the spaceship. The Kree are still surrounding the Skrulls, and Goose is being scanned with a Kree scanner]

Scanner: Species: Flerken. Threat: High.

[Bron-Char begins putting a muzzle on Goose's head, but is met by protests from Fury]

Fury: It's a cat. Not Hannibal Lecter.

Scanner: Species: Human male. Threat: Low to none.

Fury: That thing is clearly busted.

Minn-Erva: Load the Flerken onto the heli. Eject the others into space.

[The scene switches back to inside the Supreme Intelligence. Carol has just finished standing up after the pain in her neck]

Supreme Intelligence: You did good, ace. Thanks to you, those insidious shapeshifters will threaten our borders no more.

Carol: I used to believe your lies. But the Skrulls are just fighting for a home. You're talking about destroying them because they won't submit to your rule. And neither will I.

Supreme Intelligence: We found you. We embraced you as our own.

Carol: You stole me. From my home, my family, my friends.

[Carol runs forward and jumps to punch Lawson, however, her hand travels right through Lawson's skull. Lawson then throws Carol into a wall, leaving Carol hanging sideways]

Supreme Intelligence: It's cute how hard you try. Remember... without us...you're weak. (Carol pushes herself behind the wall, and sees a screen of her younger memories on Earth playing) You're flawed. Helpless. We saved you.

[The screen of Carol's failures continues to play, until she suddenly drops, falling into nothingness until suddenly landing on the floor]

Supreme Intelligence: Without us... you're only human.

Carol: You're right. I'm only human.

[Suddenly a montage plays, of Carol standing up everytime after her failures]

Supreme Intelligence: On Hala, you were reborn. Vers.

Carol: My name... is Carol.

[Carol lights up her fist, but Lawson blasts energy towards her first. Lawson's energy surrounds Carol, but Carol manages to walk towards Lawson. On the spaceship, Carol's hands begin to light up and begin burning the machine]

Korath: She's trying to break out.

[Carol continues to release energy waves from her hands. This causes all electricity on the ship to malfunction. Goose's cage comes loose, the prisoner's handcuffs suddenly pop open and the cage full of Skrulls is opened]

Carol: I've been fighting with one arm tied behind my back. But what happens... (Carol pulls out the chip attached to her neck, causing the energy from her fists to spread to cover her entire body) ...when I'm finally set free?

[Carol drops the chip before flashing back to her absorbing the energy from the explosion before flashing back to the present day where the chip explodes off her neck like a bullet and she is released from the Supreme Intelligence, glowing and floating in the air. She suddenly blasts energy from her hands, and sends four Kree flying backward in to the wall behind them. She grabs the lunchbox with the Tesseract and finds Maria and Fury]

Fury: You know you're glowing, right?

Carol: I'll explain it later. (Carol opens the lunchbox to reveal the Tesseract glowing inside) Take the Tesseract, leaving the lunchbox.

Fury: (Fury has just unbuckled Goose's collar and is now holding her) Me?

Carol: Yes.

Fury: I'm not touching that thing.

Carol: Want me to get you an oven mitt?

[Goose suddenly lurches himself out of Fury's arms and giant tentacles emerge from inside Goose's mouth. Goose picks up the Tesseract from the lunchbox and swallows it whole before returning back to a normal cat. Fury quickly drops Goose in surprise]

Carol: Get the Skrulls in the QuadJet and go. Take the Flerken with you.

Maria: What about you?

Carol: I'll buy you some time!

Fury: I'm picking you up now. I'm trusting you not to eat me.

[Carol is then seen sitting on the railing of an overhead corrider. She holds up the lunchbox in front of her before jumping over the railing once she has the Kree's attention]

Carol: Hey Guys. Arm-wrestle for the Tesseract.

Yon-Rogg: I used to find you amusing. Let's put an end to this!

[The Kree all draw their weapon and begin to advance on her. Carol simply blasts her energy down the overpass, causing the metal to snap and four Kree to be incapacitated. Carol then proceeds to take on the Kree, attacking them individually. Each fight only lasts a few seconds, but always results in Carol dominating]

[Maria picks up a gun and fires until Goose opens his mouth and the tentacles take the kree soldiers, beat them up and swallowed them]

Maria: Okay.

Fury: Good kitty.

Carol: You knew all along. Is that why we never hung out?

Minn-Erva: No. I just never liked you.

[The scene changes to Fury and Maria running through a corridor on the ship. Suddenly, a group of Kree appears behind them]

Kree: Hey! In a hurry?

[Scene changes back to the fight between Yon-Rogg and Carol. Yon-Rogg is standing above Carol, about to attack her]

Att-Lass: Don't make me do this.

Carol: Okay.

[Carol then blasts some energy, causing her to fly upwards and Yon-Rogg to fly backward towards a wall]

Fury: Now! Come on! Do your thing. Come on! Dammit, Goose. Pick a side.

Kree: Take them to the hangar too. We'll blast them all into space.

Talos: Play it cool. Just like Havana. Do you have the thing?

Fury: Flerken kitty ate it.

Kree: Come on. Move. Move!

Talos: Follow my lead. Cover her eyes. (to Soren)

[Talos then shoots the four guards escorting the Skrulls onto the ship, causing a distraction]

Talos: Get on the ship. Let's go, let's go.

[The fighting between Yon-Rogg and Carol continues. Eventually, Yon-Rogg pins Carol to the wall with a mountain of metal from the walkway. He then opens the lunchbox to find a soup container sitting inside]

Yon-Rogg: Nice diversion.

Carol: I could've swore, I put it in there.

[The fighting between Carol and Yon-Rogg restarts with Yon-Rogg throwing loose pieces of metal at Carol telepathically. Carol quickly escapes and runs towards the energy source. However, the Kree found the Skrulls had begun escaping and ran towards the hanger, shooting randomly at the ship. One of these bullets hits Talos, causing him to fall over in pain. Maria Rambeau starts the ship and leaves the Laboratory with the Skrulls and Nick Fury.]

Yon-Rogg: Minn-Erva, take them down on a dropship.

Minn-Erva: On it.

[Scene changes to the spaceship piloted by Maria]

Fury: You all right, friend?

Talos: Never... better.

Maria: We've got a bogey. Coming in hot.

[Minn-Erva follows the Skrulls down to Earth in a space pod. Yon-Rogg enters a pod, too, just as Carol catches up with him. She lights up her fists, preparing to fire, but Yon-Rogg drops the ship, catching her by surprise. She activates her helmet and holds onto the pod tightly. Meanwhile, Minn-Erva starts shooting at the Quadjet and Maria barely dodges the bullets while flying through the desert. Carol attempts to shoot Yon-Rogg again, but she is sent backwards by his magnitron device. She falls down to Earth, but she manages to calm and control her powers right before hitting the ground, which allows her to fly back up. Meanwhile Minn-Erva continues to chase down the Skrulls, as the two spaceships enter a canyon. Maria evades the bullets with ease and takes a shortcut, allowing her to be in front of Minn-Erva's pod and destroy it with blasts.]

Fury: Ha ha!

Maria: Yes! Boom!

[Yon-Rogg attacks the Quadjet, but Carol hits his pod in her flight]

Fury: What the hell was that?

[Due to the damage taken, Yon-Rogg's pod crashes into the desert. At the same time, the Accusers arrive outside Earth's atmosphere.]

Ronan: Deploy ballistic warheads.

[All spaceships launch the missiles towards Earth. Carol manages to catch one with her hands and, using her newly discovered power, throws it back, causing it to explode. The explosion destroys the rest of the warheads, while Carol flies right through the fire towards the spaceships.]

Accuser: That's impossible.

Ronan: C-53 doesn't have a defense system advanced enough to destroy our warheads.

Accuser: That's not their defense system, Ronan.

Ronan: Take her down.

[The spaceships deploy several drones which start shooting at Carol. She avoids most of them and absorbs the energy of the blasts that hit her. She then proceeds to destroy all the drones and one of the Accusers' spaceships, before flying in front of Ronan, showing her full power.]

Ronan: Return to the jump point. We'll be back for the weapon.

Accuser: The core?

Ronan: The woman.

[The Kree retreat, and Carol returns to Earth, where she confronts Yon-Rogg]

Yon-Rogg: I'm so proud of you. You've come a long way since I found you that day by the lake. But can you keep your emotions in check long enough to take me on? Or will it get the better of you, as always? I always told you... you'll be ready, the day you can knock me down as yourself. This is that moment. This is that moment, Vers! Turn off the light show, and prove, prove to me, you can beat me without...

[Carol shoots Yon-Rogg with a small blast, which sends him flying backwards and hits a rock. She then walks towards him, while he tries to crawl back.]

Carol: I have nothing to prove to you.

[Carol reaches her hand out to Yon-Rogg and he takes it. She drags him across the desert, and puts him in the Kree pod in which he crashed. Carol enters coordinates on the computer.]

Computer: Destination: Hala.

Yon-Rogg: I can't go back empty-handed.

Carol: You won't be empty-handed. I'm sending you with a message. Tell the Supreme Intelligence that I'm coming to end it. The war, the lies, all of it.

Yon-Rogg: You can't do this.

[Carol starts the spacepod, but it can't take off beacause of the damage. She fires a blast at the engine, and the spacepod finally takes off.]

[Scene changes to Nick Fury holding Goose inside the Quadjet]

Fury: That was a close call, huh, Goosey? Huh? The bad guy's still in there somewhere- [Goose scratches Nick Fury's eye] Oh! MOTHER FLERKEN!!!

Maria: You okay?

Fury: Yeah. It's just a scratch. [a serious scratch is shown on his left eye]

Talos: No...

[Scene changes to Maria's house, where everyone gathered for dinner]

Carol: I can't believe you got into the raddest dogfight ever.

Maria: I'd say you arrived just in time.

Fury: That's some nifty flying you did out there. SHIELD could always use a good pilot like you.

Maria: I'll consider it. As long as you don't call my flying nifty again. How's your eye?

Fury: Getting better every second.

Carol: Just so I'm clear, you were Soh-Larr, and the SHIELD agent?

Fury: Keller. Tied my boss up, stole his identity.

Talos: I borrowed his likeness. I'm no thief.

Soren: It's a little like thief.

Talos: Whose side are you on?

Fury: You're good to go here til you recover, but you and your family will need a new look.

Talos: I could go back to being your boss.

Fury: Please don't.

Talos: Come on. I love sporting his beautiful blue eyes.

Monica: No way, you guys have the best eyes. Don't ever change your eyes.

Carol: I'll help you find a home. Finish what Mar-Vell started.

Monica: They can stay here with us, can't they, Mom?

Maria: They won't be safe here, baby. Auntie Carol is right. They need their own home.

Carol: I'll be back before you know it.

Monica: Maybe I can fly up and meet you halfway.

Fury: Only if you learn to glow, like your Auntie Carol.

Monica: Or maybe I'll build a spaceship. You don't know.

Carol: He doesn't.

[Scene changes to Carol and Fury washing the dishes]

Carol: Keep the Tesseract on Earth. Hidden.

Fury: You're sure that's what Marvel would want?

Carol: Mar-Vell.

Fury: That's what I said.

Carol: It's two words. Mar-Vell.

Fury: Mar-Vell. Marvel sounds a lot better. You know, like the Marvelettes? [Singing] 𝅘𝅥𝅮 Oh, yeah, wait a minute Mr. Postman. Ay, ay, ay, ay, Mr. Postman. 𝅘𝅥𝅮 Not ringing any bells?

Carol: Keep singing. Maybe it'll come back to me.

[Carol takes out Fury's pages, which has her symbol on it.]

Carol: I upgraded it. Range should be, a couple galaxies, at least.

[She offers it to Fury, but before he can take it, she pulls it away.]

Fury: What? You think I'm gonna crank call you?

Carol: For emergencies only. Okay?

Fury: Well, if you're ever passing back through this galaxy, be sure to give a brother a shout.

[The two fist bump, and Carol teasingly electrocutes Fury, laughs it off.]

[Scene changes to outside of the house, where Monica gives Carol her leather jacket.]

Monica: We got the ketchup stain off.

Carol: Thanks, Lieutenant Trouble. It's hard for me to say goodbye, too.

Maria: Go on.

[Carol takes off and flies up to Mar-Vell's laboratory, where the Skrulls were waiting for her. She looks at the Earth one last time before flying inside the spaceship. As soon as she enters, the ship starts moving at lightspeed, towards other galaxies.]

[Scene changes to Fury, who is back in his office, wearing an eyepatch. He writes on his computer about "The Protector Initiative". Phil Coulson enters the room with a suitcase in his hands.]

Coulson: Glad to have you back, sir. This came for you.

[Fury opens the suitcase to reveal lots of prosthetic eyes of different colors.]

Coulson: So, is it true? That the Kree burned your eye out because you refused to give them the Tesseract?

Fury: I'll neither confirm nor deny the facts of that story.

Coulson: Understood. I'm sorry to report that we still haven't found the Tesseract.

Fury: I'm sure it will turn up somewhere.

[Fury looks at Goose, who now lives with him]

Coulson: I'll let you know when it does.

Fury: Then what?

Coulson: Sir?

Fury: We have no idea what other intergalactic threats are out there. And our one-woman security force had a prior commitment on the other side of the universe. SHIELD alone can't protect us. We need to find more.

Coulson: More weapons?

Fury: More heroes.

Coulson: You think we can find others like her?

Fury: We found her and we weren't even looking.

Coulson: Get some rest, sir. You got a big decision to make.

[Fury looks through Carol's file and finds out that she was nicknamed "Avenger". He then decides to rename his project "The Avengers Initiative".]

[Mid-Credits scene]

[In 2018, The pager is seen with the Captain Marvel symbol. Second later, the pager turns off. In another room, The Avengers are dealing with the consequences of the failed counterattack against Thanos that lead to the decimation process as they return to the New Avengers Headquarters. On the computer, the numbers continues to rise as the global death toll reaches 3.2 billion.]

Steve Rogers: This is a nightmare.

Natasha Romanoff: I've had better nightmares.

[James Rhodes walks in]

James Rhodes (Rhodey): Hey. So that thing just stopped doing whatever the hell it was doing.

[Rhodes, Romanoff, and Rogers head to the chamber housing the transmitter device, where Bruce Banner is analyzing it.]

Natasha: What have we got?

Bruce Banner: Whatever the signal is sending, it finally creeped off.

Steve: I thought we bypassed the battery.

Rhodey: We did. It's still plugged in, it just... it just stopped.

Steve: Reboot and send the signal again.

Banner: We don't even know what this is.

Natasha: Fury did. Just do it, please. You tell me the second you get a signal. I want to know who's on the other end of that thing.

[As Romanoff turns around, she finds herself face to face with Carol Danvers.]

Carol: Where's Fury?

[Cut to black.]

[Screen title: Captain Marvel will return in Avengers: Endgame]

[Post-Credits Scene]

[Back in 1995, inside Fury's office, Goose jumps on her owner's desk. She vomits the Tesseract on the desk and starts grooming herself.]

[Bucky Barnes is secured in a chair, a mechanical device either side of his head causing him to scream in pain.]
Vasily Karpov: [speaking Russian] Желание. Ржавый. Семнадцать. Рассвет. Печь. Девять. Добросердечный. Возвращение на родину. Один. Грузовой вагон.[1] ([subtitled] Longing. Rusted. Seventeen.

[Night. A car is driving down a dirt road alone. The Winter Soldier is waiting at the side of the road with his motorcycle. As the car passes, the Winter Soldier follows. He comes alongside the car and disables it. It slams into a tree. The Winter Soldier brings the motorcycle back around and climbs off.

[Marvel Opening Credits]
[Lagos, present day]
[Wanda Maximoff, aka Scarlet Witch, adds sugar to a cup and stirs it. She looks around.]
Steve Rogers: [on radio] All right, what do you see?
Wanda Maximoff: Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street. It’s a good target.
Steve Rogers: There’s an ATM in the south corner, which means . . .
Wanda Maximoff: Cameras.
Steve Rogers: Both cross streets are one way.
Wanda Maximoff: So, compromised escape routes.
Steve Rogers: Means our guy doesn't care about being seen, he isn't afraid to make a mess on the way out. You see that Range Rover halfway up the block?
Wanda Maximoff: Yeah, the red one? It’s cute.
[Camera pans to show Natasha sitting two tables from Wanda]
Natasha Romanoff: [on radio] It's also bulletproof, which means private security, which means more guns, which means more headaches for somebody. Probably us.
Wanda Maximoff: You guys know I can move things with my mind, right?
Natasha Romanoff: Looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature.
Sam Wilson: Anybody ever tell you you're a little paranoid?
Natasha Romanoff: Not to my face. Why? Did you hear something?
Steve Rogers: Eyes on target, folks. This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow in six months. I don't want to lose him.
Sam Wilson: If he sees us coming that won't be a problem. He kind of hates us.
[A garbage truck is pushing its way through traffic, with no regard to pedestrians or other vehicles]
Steve Rogers: Sam, see that garbage truck? Tag it.
[From the back of Sam’s Falcon jet pack, a small drone, launches and flies down to scan the garbage truck.]
Sam Wilson: Give me X-ray.
[weight analysis: Cargo Weight: 13825 kgs. Max capacity.]
Sam Wilson: That truck’s loaded for max weight. And the driver’s armed.
Natasha Romanoff: It’s a battering ram.
Steve Rogers: Go now.
Wanda Maximoff: What?
Steve Rogers: He’s not hitting the police.
[INSTITUTE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES]
[A man is sitting in the guard station. He looks over as the garbage truck is coming towards the gate. The driver jumps out, and the truck slams into the gateway. Two trucks rush into the compound through the newly-made entrance.]
[Soldiers in black armor emerge from the trucks, firing their rifles around the courtyard. Four soldiers fire gas canisters into the building. Soldiers wearing gas masks enter.]
[Steve arrives and takes out several of the soldiers.]
Steve Rogers: Body armor, AR-15's. I make seven hostiles.
[Sam flies in and up to a rooftop, spinning and using his wings to block gunfire. He takes out two soldiers.]
Sam Wilson: I make 5.
[Wanda arrives and flies over the rooftop and into the courtyard, blocking fire with her powers. She takes control of one soldier and lifts him upward.]
Wanda Maximoff: Sam.
[Sam glides down from the rooftop, catching the soldier on one of his wings.]
Sam Wilson: Four.
[Sam's drone flies by, scanning the inside of the building.]
Sam Wilson: Rumlow’s on the third floor.
Steve Rogers: Wanda, just like we practiced.
Wanda Maximoff: What about the gas?
Steve Rogers: Get it out.
[Wanda uses her powers to lift Steve up and through the window. He grabs a soldier and pulls off their gas mask]
[Rumlow is inside. He punches down the door. He knocks aside a technician and enters a room with a container labeled "bio-hazard."]
Brock Rumlow: Pack it up.
[In another area, Steve is behind a pillar. He throws his shield, and it bounces off the soldier and back to Steve. Meanwhile, Wanda is now using her powers to remove the gas from the building. Sam is exchanging fire with several soldiers.]
[Rumlow walks outside onto a balcony and sees that Steve’s team is here.]
Brock Rumlow: He’s here.
[Inside the building, Steve sees the vial missing.]
Steve Rogers: Rumlow has a biological weapon.
[Natasha is riding in on a motorcycle.]
Natasha Romanoff: (on radio) I’m on it.
[She jumps off the motorcycle and it skids toward a soldier. She takes out soldiers through hand-to-hand combat. Rumlow comes up behind her and grabs her collar, dragging her onto an armored vehicle. She electrocutes him.]
Brock Rumlow: I don't work like that no more.
[He throws her through the roof hatch into an armored vehicle, drops in a grenade, and shuts the hatch.]
Brock Rumlow: Fire in the hole.
Mercenary: No!
[Natasha takes out the soldiers inside, then grabs one to shield herself from the grenade. The doors blow open and she is thrown out.]
[Steve runs out onto the balcony and spots Rumlow.]
Steve Rogers: Sam. He's in an AFV heading north.
[Inside the AFV, Rumlow secures the biological weapon and hands it to a soldier.]
Brock Rumlow: Take this to the airstrip. We're not gonna outrun them. Lose the truck.
[The truck crashes into a nearby structure and Rumlow and the soldiers emerge.]
Mercenary #1: Where are you going to meet us?
Brock Rumlow: I’m not.
[Sam lands on the roof of a structure. He scans the area with his goggles.]
Sam Wilson: I got four, they're splitting up.
[Natasha rides through the crowd, back on her motorcycle. She abandons it again and runs across the hoods of cars, in pursuit.]
Natasha Romanoff: I got the two on the left.
[Steve is also running across cars. He spots a vest in the middle of a crowd.]
Steve Rogers: They ditched their gear. It's a shell game now. One of them has the payload.
[Someone throws a bomb at Steve. It sticks on his shield. Steve throws it in the air and the bomb detonates safely away from citizens. Rumlow comes up behind Steve and punches him in the back.]
Brock Rumlow: There you are, you son of a bitch. I’ve been waiting for this!
[Meanwhile, Sam is still chasing the other mercenaries. Sam flies up and takes out his two, then searches their bags for the payload.]
Sam Wilson: He doesn't have it. I’m empty.
[Natasha is chasing the soldiers through the crowd.]
Natasha Romanoff: Out of the way!
[She tackles one soldier and engages him in combat. When the other soldier arrives, she hurls a basket at him to distract him. She uses her skills to fight them and ends up face-to-face with one soldier. They point their guns at each other. A moment passes. Then, the other soldier produces the vial.]
Mercenary #1: Drop it. Or I’ll drop this. Drop it!
Mercenary #2: He'll do it!
[Redwing descends and fires at the soldier with the vial. He drops, and in the moment of distraction, Natasha fires at the other soldier, then catches the falling vial.]
Natasha Romanoff: Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.
Sam Wilson: Don't thank me.
Natasha Romanoff: I’m… not thanking that thing.
Sam Wilson: His name is Redwing.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm still not thanking it.
Sam Wilson: He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.
[Steve and Rumlow are still fighting, neither one seeming to have the upper hand.]
Brock Rumlow: Come on!
[Rumlow pins Steve to a building and extends a blade from one of his gauntlets.]
Brock Rumlow: This is for dropping a building on my face.
[Steve grabs Rumlow's arm and pulls the gauntlet off, only for Rumlow to reveal another knife. But Steve bests him. Defeated, on his knees, Rumlow removes his mask, revealing a scarred face.]
Brock Rumlow: I think I look pretty good, all things considered.
Steve Rogers: Who's your buyer?
Brock Rumlow: You know, he knew you. You pal, your buddy, your Bucky.
Steve Rogers: What did you say?
Brock Rumlow: He remembered you. I was there. He got all weepy about it. Till they put his brain back in a blender. He wanted you to know something. He said to me, "Please tell Rogers. When you gotta go, you gotta go." And you're coming with me.
[He activates his bomb vest and Steve flinches as Rumlow's armor ignites, but Wanda keeps the blast contained around Rumlow who grimaces in agony. She lifts him into the air before she loses control, and the explosion finally blossoms, devastating entire floors of a nearby office building. Wanda sees what happened and covers her mouth in shock.]
Steve Rogers: Oh my . . . [Steve stares up, open mouthed.] Sam . . . We need . . . Fire and Rescue . . . on the south side of the building. We gotta get up there.
[Soft piano is playing. Tony Stark's mother, Maria, sits at a piano. A young Tony is on the couch.]
Maria Stark: Try to remember the kind of September. When grass was green . . . [She stops singing as Howard Stark walks in, but continues playing.] Wake up, dear, and say goodbye to your father.
Howard Stark: Who's the homeless person on the couch?
[Tony, wearing a Santa hat, staggers to his feet and chuckles.]
Young Tony Stark: This is why I love coming home for Christmas . . . right before you leave town.
Maria Stark: Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.
Howard Stark: Really, which broad? What's her name?
Young Tony Stark: Candice.
[Howard pulls of Tony's hat.]
Howard Stark: Do me a favor? Try not to burn the house down before Monday.
Young Tony Stark: Okay, so it's Monday. That is good to know. I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going?
Maria Stark: You father's flying us to the Bahamas for a little getaway.
Howard Stark: We might have to make a quick stop.
Young Tony Stark: At the Pentagon. Right? Don't worry, you're gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary.
[Maria stops playing the piano.]
Howard Stark: You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that's true, you'll be a great man some day. I'll get the bags.
[He walks out of the room, and Maria stands up.]
Maria Stark: He does miss you when you are not here. And frankly, you're going to miss us. Because this is the last time we're all going to be together. You know what's about to happen. Say something. If you don't, you'll regret it.
[Howard walks back in.]
Young Tony Stark: I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could.
[Maria leans in to kiss Tony on the cheek, and when she leans back, an older Tony Stark is standing in the background. Howard and Maria walk out, leaving the two Tonys.]
Tony Stark: That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh.
[He blows on a candle and everything around him shimmers, then starts to dissolve. It's a hologram.]
Tony Stark: It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . . [He takes off his glasses.] Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it.
[He is standing on a stage in front of a large crowd. A sign reads MIT Alumni Honors: Tony Stark.]
Tony Stark: Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? "To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges." Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke.
[The crowd chuckles.]
Tony Stark: Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded.
[The crowd breaks out in applause and cheering.]
Tony Stark: No strings, no taxes… just re-frame the future! Starting now.
[The teleprompter above the audience reads. 'Now I would like to introduce the head of the foundation: Pepper Potts.' Tony stares at it sadly.]
Tony Stark: Go break some eggs.
[He exits the stage.]
MIT teacher: Wow. Wow. That uh . . . that took my breathe away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity . . . will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hot dog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded . . .
[Tony is not listening.]
Tony Stark: Restroom's this way, yeah?
MIT teacher: Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.
Stark's Assistant: Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it.
Tony Stark: It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.
MIT teacher: We'll catch up later.
[Tony steps into a quiet corridor. He loiters by the men's room, then glances back at the stage door before walking towards the elevator. A woman in sober clothes is also waiting. Tony stops and turns his back to the wall.]
Mrs. Spencer: That was nice, what you did for those young people.
Tony Stark: Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
Mrs. Spencer: They say there's a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you've got the money . . . break as many eggs as you like. Right?
[He narrows his eyes and half smiles, then turns to face the elevator. He looks surprised to find the button unlit and pushes it himself.]
Tony Stark: Are you going up?
Mrs. Spencer: I'm right where I want to be.
[She digs in her handbag, Tony grabs her wrist. He realizes what he's done.]
Tony Stark: Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
Mrs. Spencer: I work for the State Department. Human Resources. I know it's boring . . . but it enabled me to raise a son. I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.
[She shoves a photo at him.]
Mrs Spencer: His name was Charlie Spencer. You murdered him. In Sokovia. Not that it matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us. You just fight for yourself.
[Tony shakes his head.]
Mrs Spencer: Who's going to avenge my son, Stark? He's dead . . . and I blame you.
[She turns and walks away, leaving Tony standing by the elevator with a grim frown.]
[At the Avengers Compound. Steve catches Wanda watching a news report on the Lagos attack and how they blame her for it.]
News Anchor #1: 11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries in Lagos, Nigeria, last month. The traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission in Lagos when the attack occurred.
King T'Chaka: Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only because of the actions of criminals, but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all.
News Anchor #1: The Wakanda king went on to . . .
[Steve, who was watching the news, turns his computer off, but sound drifts toward him from another room.]
News anchor #2: They are operating outside and above the international law. Because that's the reality, if we don't respond to acts like these.
[Wanda is sitting on her bed, watching the news on her TV.]
News Anchor #2 What legal authority does an enhanced individual like Wanda Maximoff have to operate in Nigeri -
[The TV turns off. Steve sets the remote down and leans on the door frame.]
Wanda Maximoff: It's my fault.
Steve Rogers: That's not true.
Wanda Maximoff: Turn the TV back on. They're being very specific.
Steve Rogers: I should've clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it.
[He walks over.]
Steve Rogers: Rumlow said "Bucky" and . . . all of a sudden I was a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn. [He sits beside Wanda.]
Steve Rogers: And people died. It's on me.
Wanda Maximoff: It's on both of us.
Steve Rogers: This job . . . we try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody. But if we can't find a way to live with that, next time . . . maybe nobody gets saved.
[Vision materializes through the wall. Wanda starts.]
[Vision interrupts Wanda and Steve by walking through the wall into Wanda’s room]
Wanda Maximoff: Vis! We talked about this.
Vision: Yes, but the door was open so I assumed that . . .
[He gestures at the door and stops.]
Vision: Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.
Steve Rogers: Thank you. We'll be right down.
Vision: I'll . . . use the door. Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.
Steve Rogers: We know who it is?
Vision: The Secretary of State.
[The Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross, is standing at the head of a table. Rhodey, Natasha, Steve, Tony, Sam, Vision, and Wanda are gathered around.]
[The Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross has summoned the Avengers to a meeting]
Secretary Ross: Five years ago, I had a heart attack. I dropped right in the middle of my back-swing. Turned out it was the best round of my life, because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass . . . I found something 40 years in the Army had never taught me: Perspective. The world owes the Avengers an un-payable debt. You have fought for us, protected us, risked your lives . . . but while a great many people see you as heroes, there are some . . . who would prefer the word "vigilantes".
Natasha Romanoff: And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary?
Secretary Ross: How about "dangerous"? What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders and inflict their will wherever they choose and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind?
[Ross activates a screen behind him. News footage from past Avengers and SHIELD matters flash on the screen as he speaks.]
Secretary Ross: New York.
[A Chitauri leviathan. Terrified citizens. A soldier firing a gun. The Hulk smashes into a building and sends a dust cloud to engulf the camera.]
[Rhodey looks regretful. He glances behind him at Natasha.]
Secretary Ross: Washington DC.
[The three Insight helicarriers, firing on each other. The destroyed Triskelion. A helicarrier crashing into the Potomac and throwing up a massive wave, engulfing citizens and the camera.]
[Sam looks down.]
Secretary Ross: Sokovia.
[Terrified citizens, running. The city rising. A building falling over.]
[Wanda stares at the screen, as does Tony.]
Secretary Ross: Lagos.
[The burning building. Paramedics moving a body. A dead girl.]
[Wanda is particularly affected by the footage from Lagos. Steve sees this and intervenes.]
Steve Rogers: Okay. That's enough.
[Secretary Ross nods to an aide and the images disappear.]
Secretary Ross: For the past four years, you've operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. [he places a thick document on the desk and passes it to Wanda]
[An aide hands him a thick book, which Ross slides across the table to Wanda. She picks it up, then slides it to Rhodey.]
Secretary Ross: The Sokovia Accords. Approved by 117 countries . . . it states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel, only when and if that panel deems it necessary.
Steve Rogers: The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place. I feel we've done that.
Secretary Ross: Tell me, Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now?
[Steve looks up and meets Ross's eyes.]
Secretary Ross: If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes . . . you can bet there'd be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground.
James Rhodes: So, there are contingencies.
Secretary Ross: Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords.
[Steve glances at Tony.]
Secretary Ross: Talk it over.
Natasha Romanoff: And if we come to a decision you don't like?
Secretary Ross: Then you retire.
[Natasha stifles a smile.]
[Cleveland.]
[Vasily Karpov sits, eating at the table in a cluttered house. He hears the sound of something crashing outside and peers through drawn blinds. Outside, Helmut Zemo stands by his car, the front end crumpled against Karpov's car.]
Helmut Zemo: Hello? Is this your car out front?
[Zemo comes to the door.]
Helmut Zemo: I jumped the curb.
[Karpov eyes his gun nearby.]
Helmut Zemo: Maybe we could take care of it ourselves. If you wanna call the cops, tha--that's okay too, I guess.
Vasily Karpov: No. No cops.
Helmut Zemo: Thank you.
[Karpov slides a heavy duty lock and opens the door. Zemo punches him.]
[Zemo is using a sledgehammer to smash a hole in the wall. He retrieves a large box from inside the hole and tips the contents onto a table. Karpov is hanging upside down, tied to pipes in his basement. There are various documents and the red book with the star on the cover. He holds the red book for a moment then opens a file. Inside is a photo of Karpov in his military uniform and beret.]
Helmut Zemo: You have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations.
[Karpov's head is in a sink, which is filling with water.]
Helmut Zemo: "Mission report: December 16, 1991."
Vasily Karpov: Who are you?
Helmut Zemo: My name is Zemo. I will repeat my question. Mission report. December 16, 1991.
Vasily Karpov: How did you find me?
Helmut Zemo: When SHIELD fell, Black Widow released HYDRA files to the public. Millions of pages much of it encrypted, not easy to decipher. But . . . I have experience. And patience. A man can do anything if he has those.
Vasily Karpov: What do you want?
Helmut Zemo: Mission report. December 16. 1991.
Vasily Karpov: Go . . . to . . . hell.
[Zemo goes to lean on the sink as water continues to flow into it. He turns off the tap and studies Karpov's upside down face.]
Helmut Zemo: HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I'd have to use this book . . . and other bloodier methods to find what I need. I don't look forward to that. You'd only be dying for . . . your pride.
[Zemo stares at Karpov then nods resignedly. He turns the tap back on. The water is up to Karpov's eyes. Zemo watches the water level rise.]
Vasily Karpov: Hail HYDRA.
[Holding the red book Zemo walks away. Karpov twitches and struggles in his bindings.]
[The Avengers are gathered at HQ. Steve is sitting, studying the Accords, while Rhodey and Sam argue behind him.]
James Rhodes: Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honor, which is one more than you have.
Sam Wilson: So let's say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?
James Rhodes: A 117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and you're just like, "No, that's cool. We got it. "
Sam Wilson: How long are you going to play both sides?
Vision: I have an equation.
Sam Wilson: Oh, this will clear it up.
Vision: In the eight years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate.
Steve Rogers: Are you saying it's our fault?
Vision: I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict . . . breeds catastrophe. Oversight . . . oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.
James Rhodes: Boom.
[Tony is lying on the couch, one hand over his face. When Natasha speaks, he removes the hand to look at her.]
Natasha Romanoff: Tony. You are being uncharacteristically non-hyper-verbal.
Steve Rogers: It's because he's already made up his mind.
Tony Stark: Boy, you know me so well.
[He gets up and winces, rubbing the back of his head.]
Tony Stark: Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache.
[He walks to the kitchen and grabs a mug.]
Tony Stark: That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?
[He puts his phone in a basket and taps it.The phone projects an image of a smiling young man. He looks down, then back up, and pretends to notice the picture for the first time.]
Tony Stark: Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia.
[The others look affected by this .]
Tony Stark: He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass. [He takes a pill with some coffee, then faces the others.]
Tony Stark: There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys.
Steve Rogers: Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up.
Tony Stark: Who said we're giving up?
Steve Rogers: We are if we're not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blames.
James Rhodes: I'm sorry. Steve. That - that is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we're talking about. It's not the World Security Council, it's not SHIELD, it's not HYDRA.
Steve Rogers: No, but it's run by people with agendas, and agendas change.
Tony Stark: That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing.
Steve Rogers: Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.
Tony Stark: If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
Wanda Maximoff: You're saying they'll come for me.
Vision: We would protect you.
Natasha Romanoff: Maybe Tony's right.
[Tony looks at her, surprised.]
Natasha Romanoff: If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off -
Sam Wilson: Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?
Natasha Romanoff: I'm just . . . I'm reading the terrain. We have made . . . some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back.
Tony Stark: Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, I want to take it back now.
Tony Stark: No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win.
[Steve's phone buzzes, and he pulls it out to check it. A text message reads: 'She's gone. In her sleep.']
Steve Rogers: I have to go.
[Steve gets up sharply, drops the Accords on the coffee table, and goes downstairs. He stops at the bottom of the stairs, leans against the banister, and bows his head.]
[London.]
[A cathedral, packed with mourners. A choir is singing. Steve is one of six pallbearers carrying a coffin draped with the Union Jack. His eyes are red--he's been crying.]
[At the altar, a candle burns by a framed photograph of Peggy Carter in a military uniform. The label reads "Margaret 'Peggy' Carter". The priest addresses the mourners.]
Priest: And now, I would like to invite Sharon Carter to come up and say a few words.
[Agent 13, Steve's "neighbor" from DC, steps up to the podium.]
[Steve sits beside Sam in a pew at the front. Steve is looking down and doesn't see Sharon walk up. Sam is watching, and nudges Steve. He looks up to see Sharon, who glances at Steve and takes a breath.]
Sharon Carter: Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of SHIELD . . . but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.
[Steve realizes who exactly Sharon is, and takes a surprised breath.]
Sharon Carter: She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related.
[She looks directly at Steve.]
Sharon Carter: I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. And she said, compromise where you can. But where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move . . . it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say " No, you move."
[Later, Steve stands alone in the isle, still dressed in black. Natasha to him and he turns to her. He begins to speak without any introduction]
Steve Rogers: When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. Then I found out that she was alive. I was just lucky to have her.
Natasha Romanoff: She had you back, too.
Steve Rogers: Who else signed?
Natasha Romanoff: Tony. Rhodey. Vision.
Steve Rogers: Clint?
Natasha Romanoff: Says he's retired.
[She smiles slightly.]
Steve Rogers: Wanda?
Natasha Romanoff: TBD (To Be Determined). I'm off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords. There's plenty of room on the jet.
[Steve sighs and bows his head.]
Natasha Romanoff: Just because it's the path of least resistance doesn't mean it's the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together.
[Natasha almost seems to be convincing herself.]
Steve Rogers: What are we giving up to do it?
[She sighs. He shakes his head, unconvinced.]
Steve Rogers: I'm sorry, Nat. I can't sign it.
Natasha Romanoff: I know.
Steve Rogers: Then what are you doing here?
Natasha Romanoff: I didn't want you to be alone.
[She pulls him in for a hug.]
Natasha Romanoff: Come here.
[Vienna.]
[The United Nations, a modern complex of interestingly-shaped high rise buildings.]
News Anchor #3: At a special United Nations conference 117 countries have come together to ratify the Sokovia Accords.
[T'Challa wears a sharp suit and stands, looking through a glass wall.]
UN staffer: Excuse me, Miss Romanoff?
Natasha Romanoff: Yes?
UN staffer: These need your signature. [T'Challa looks over at Natasha.] Thank you.
Natasha Romanoff: Thanks.
T'Challa: I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight.
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.
T'Challa: You seem to be doing alright so far. Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill . . . I wouldn't think you would be particularly comfortable in this company.
Natasha Romanoff: Well, I'm not.
T'Challa: That alone makes me glad you're here, Miss Romanoff.
Natasha Romanoff: Why? You don't approve of all this?
T'Challa: The Accords, yes. The politics, not really. Two people in a room can get more done than a hundred.
King T'Chaka: Unless you need to move a piano.
T'Challa: Father.
King T'Chaka: Son. Miss Romanoff.
Natasha Romanoff: King T'Chaka. Please, allow me to apologize for what happened in Nigeria.
King T'Chaka: Thank you. Thank you for agreeing to all this. I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today.
Natasha Romanoff: Yes, so am I.
Man on speakers: If everyone could please be seated. This assembly is now in session.
T'Challa: That is the future calling. Such a pleasure.
Natasha Romanoff: Thank you. [Natasha goes.]
King T'Chaka: For a man who disapproves of diplomacy, you're getting quite good at it.
T'Challa: I'm happy, Father.
King T'Chaka: Thank you.
T'Challa: Thank you.
King T'Chaka: When stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon, we in Wakanda were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria, were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for supporting this initiative. [T'Challa spots something outside.] Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace.
T'Challa: EVERYBODY GET DOWN!
[An enormous explosion goes off between two buildings and destroys the conference hall. T'Challa finds his father lying on the floor with his eyes closed. He grabs his father's wrist and feels for a pulse, but his father lies still. Devastated T'Challa lies across his father. He lifts him up and rocks him in his arms.]
[A hotel.]
Sharon Carter: My mom tried to talk me out of enlisting, but, um, not Aunt Peggy. She bought me my first thigh holster.
Steve Rogers: Very practical.
Sharon Carter: And stylish. [Sharon and Steve wait by an elevator. They stand facing each other.]
Steve Rogers: CIA has you stationed over here now?
Sharon Carter: In Berlin, Joint Terrorism Task Force.
Steve Rogers: Right. Right. Sounds fun.
Sharon Carter: I know, right?
Steve Rogers: [Steve nods and smiles at Sharon.] I've been meaning to ask you. When you were spying on me from across the hall . . . .
Sharon Carter: You mean when I was doing my job.
Steve Rogers: Did Peggy know?
Sharon Carter: She kept so many secrets. I didn't want her to have one from you. [The elevator arrives.] Thanks for walking me back.
Steve Rogers: Sure. [Sam comes over.]
Sam Wilson: Steve. There's something you gotta see.
News anchor #4: A bomb hidden in a news van . . .
Sharon Carter: Who's coordinating?
News anchor #4: . . . ripped through the UN building in Vienna.
Sharon Carter: Good. They're solid. Forensics?
News anchor #4: More than 70 people have been injured. At least 12 are dead, including Wakanda's King T'Chaka. Officials have released a video of a suspect who they have identified as James Buchanan Barnes, the Winter Soldier. The infamous HYDRA agent, linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations.
Sharon Carter: I have to go to work.
[Fire crews hose down the buildings. A red and white medical chopper flies overhead.]
Sharon Carter: Call MI-6, see if we can get Micro Forensics to hurry this up. We need the whole team here in two hours or it's not worth it. [Sharon strides through with a man in a green jumpsuit. They pass T'Challa who sits on a bench looking stunned. There's a cut on his head. Natasha sits on the next bench along.]
Natasha Romanoff: I'm very sorry.
T'Challa: [He glances at her. He's holding an ornate silver ring which he toys with between his fingers.] In my culture death is not the end. It's more of a . . . stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands and Bast and Sekhmet, they lead you into the green veldt where . . . you can run forever.
Natasha Romanoff: That sounds very peaceful.
T'Challa: My father thought so. [He puts the ring on his finger.] I am not my father.
Natasha Romanoff: T'Challa. Task force will decide who brings in Barnes.
T'Challa: [He clenches his fist.] Don't bother, Miss Romanoff. I'll kill him myself. [He walks away.]
[Steve phones Natasha. He's standing on the street in a cap and dark glasses.]
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah?
Steve Rogers: You alright?
Natasha Romanoff: Ah, yeah, thanks. I got lucky. [Frowning she looks around, then stands up.] I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do. Stay home. You'll only make this worse. For all of us. Please.
Steve Rogers: Are you saying you'll arrest me?
Natasha Romanoff: No. Someone will. If you interfere. That's how it works now.
Steve Rogers: If he's this far gone, Nat, I should be the one to bring him in.
Natasha Romanoff: Why?
Steve Rogers: Because I'm the one least likely to die trying. [Not far away Steve ends the call.]
Natasha Romanoff: Shit.
[Steve approaches Sam sitting at the counter of a coffee shop.]
Sam Wilson: She tell you to stay out of it? [He's also in a cap and shades.] Might have a point.
Steve Rogers: He'd do it for me.
Sam Wilson: 1945, maybe. I just want to make sure we considered all our options. The people that shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me. [Sharon arrives by Steve.]
Sharon Carter: Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public. Everybody thinks the Winter soldier goes to their gym. Most of it's noise. Except for this. [She slides Steve a file.] My boss expects a briefing, pretty much now . . . so that's all the head start you're gonna get.
Steve Rogers: Thank you.
Sharon Carter: And you're gonna have to hurry. We have orders to shoot on sight.
[Zemo sits in a hotel room. He reads from Karpov's red book.]
Helmut Zemo: Возвращение на Родину. Возвращение на Родину. Один. Один. Грузовой вагон… Грузовой вагон. Грузов- ([subtitled] Homecoming. One. One. Fright Car.) [Knocking at the door. He puts the book in a drawer and goes to the door. He reaches for a gun tucked in the back of his trouser and cocks it.]
German Innkeeper: Herr Müller, ich habe Ihr Frühstück. ([subtitled] Mr. Müller. I have your breakfast.) [Zemo opens the door.]
Helmut Zemo: Ich konnte es schon von weitem riechen. Danke. ([subtitled] I could smell it before I opened the door. Thank you.)
German Innkeeper: Speck und schwarzer Kaffe. Wieder. Ich kann Ihnen auch was anderes machen, wenn Sie das möchten. ([subtitled] Side of bacon and black coffee. Again. I can make you something different, if you like.)
Helmut Zemo: Bitte sehr, das ist wunderbar. ([subtitled] It's okay. This is wonderful.)
German Innkeeper: Ich stell es dann mal hier hin… ([subtitled] I'll put this on your . . .)
Helmut Zemo: Nein, nein. Das geht schon. Ich mach das. Vielen Dank, Frau Leiber. ([subtitled] No, no. It's okay. I can manage. Thank you Mrs. Leiber.) [Zemo closes the door. In the room is a large device with a cage at the bottom and a drum of coppered wire on top.]
[Bucharest. Bucky is in civvies at a fruit store. He buys some plums!]
Bucky Barnes: [talking to the vendor in Romanian] ([assumed translation] How are they? Are they good? Give me six, thank you.[2])
[In a black cap and casual jacket Bucky walks along scanning around. Across the street he spots a twenty-something vender at a news-stand watching him. Bucky glances away, then looks back at the vender who's still watching him. The vender runs from his kiosk. Bucky goes over and picks up a paper. On the front page there are surveillance-photos of a man and the head line: 'Winter Soldier cautat pentru Bombardmentul din Viena'. Bucky glances around tensely.]
[In his dark blue, armored suit with his shield on his arm Steve is in a small apartment. He looks around, there's a mattress with disheveled covers and various bits of cheap looking furniture. The kitchen and bedroom are in the same room. Steve finds a notebook on top of the fridge. He picks it up and opens it. There are tabs of varying colors sticking out from amongst the pages.]
Sam Wilson: [on radio] Heads up, Cap. German Special Forces, approaching from the south.
Steve Rogers: Understood. [Bucky's standing behind Steve. Steve slowly turns around to face him.] Do you know me?
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky stares at him.] You're Steve. I read about you in a museum.
Sam Wilson: They've set the perimeter.
Steve Rogers: I know you're nervous. And you have plenty of reason to be. But you're lying.
Bucky Barnes: I wasn't in Vienna. I don't do that anymore.
Sam Wilson: They're entering the building.
Steve Rogers: Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they're not planning on taking you alive.
Bucky Barnes: That's smart. Good strategy.
Sam Wilson: They're on the roof. I'm compromised.
[Armed cops run upstairs.]
Steve Rogers: This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck.
[Outside the door a cop readies a battering ram.]
Bucky Barnes: It always ends in a fight.
Sam Wilson: 5 seconds.
Steve Rogers: You pulled me from the river. Why?
Bucky Barnes: I don't know.
Sam Wilson: 3 seconds!
Steve Rogers: Yes, you do.
Sam Wilson: Breach! Breach! Breach! [A grenade crashes through the window. Bucky kicks it to Steve, and he smothers it with his shield.]
GSG-9 Soldier: Schieß die Tür auf! (Shoot the door!) [The cop slams the battering ram against the door. Bucky shields himself with the mattress against an attack from the window. He blocks the door with a table as cops swing in on cables. Steve pulls the rug from under a policeman, sending him flying. Bucky slams another policeman into the wall.]
Steve Rogers: Buck, stop! You're gonna kill someone.
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky slams Steve down and punches a hole in the floor.] I'm not gonna kill anyone.
[Bucky grabs a backpack from under the floorboards and throws it out of the window. Bucky and Steve get behind Steve's shield to avoid gunfire. Bucky shoves Steve and he knocks a cop over. Bucky holds up his metal hand and repells bullets, then slams a cop into shelves. Bucky picks up a large cement brick and slams it into a cop. Steve fights a cop on the balcony. A cop shoots around the door outside. Bucky punches through the wall beside he door. He lays into the cops. A cop descends through a sky-light on a zip wire. Bucky grabs the cop's gun and slams him into the wall. Bucky bashes a couple of cops with the battering ram. More of the police team hurry up the stairwell. Bucky jumps on the zip-line-guy and swings down a level.]
GSG-9 Soldier: Der Verdächtige ist ausgebrochen. Er ist am östlichen Treppenschacht. ([subtitled] Suspect has broken containment! He's headed down the east stairwell!)
[Steve grabs the radio and crushes it. Steve jumps down a level as Bucky keeps punching the cops. Bucky tosses one of them over the railing and Steve catches him, stopping the cop from falling. He looks at Bucky wearily.]
Steve Rogers: Come on, man.
[Steve throws the cop up onto the landing. Bucky breaks a banister and swings down on it. Steve hurls a cop over his shoulders. Bucky lays into jet more cops and takes them out. A cop aims at Bucky and Steve knocks the gun from his hands with his shield which sticks in the wall. Bucky leaps down the stairwell and catches onto a railing. Steve pulls his shiel out of the wall. Bucky climbs up then runs along a corridor and leaps off a balcony. He tumbles onto the lower roof of the neighboring building where he finds where his backpack. he picks it up and runs.]
[A muscular man clad entirely in black, Black Panther, slams into Bucky from behind, knocking him down. He has a full face mask with pointed ears. He extends his fingers and sharp claws pop out. He attacks Bucky with sweeping kicks and slashes. Bucky fights back but is kicked into a wall. Black Panther swipes his claws and spins gracefully. Bucky narrowly avoids being slashed, he holds up a metal bar to protect himself.]
[Steve looks down at them as Falcon swoops from the sky.]
Steve Rogers: Sam, southwest rooftop.
Sam Wilson: Who the hell's the other guy?
Steve Rogers: About to find out.
[Steve leaps from the balcony down onto the neighboring building as a chopper flies up. Black Panther lunges at Bucky with his claws, but Bucky grabs his wrists. A soldier fires a machine gun from the chopper. The ammo bounces off Black Panther's armored suit.]
Steve Rogers: Sam.
Sam Wilson: Got him. [Sam flies down and shoves the chopper off course. Then swoops towards street level.]
[Bucky breaks free from his attacker, slings his bag on his back, runs and jumps down a level. Black Panther slides down the wall using his claws for traction. Back lands at street level and the chase continues. Steve follows and lands rolling along the ground. Gunfire from the chopper tears up the sidewalk. Bucky jumps down through an opening and lands in an underpass, he runs through the traffic. Black Panther and Captain America drop down and chase after Bucky. A Special Forces Vehicle pursues them.]
GSG-9 Driver: Stand down! Stand down! [The vehicle closes in, blue lights flashing. Steve leaps onto the vehicle and splinters the windshield. The driver stops, Steve yanks him from the vehicle and kicks the windshield out, then drives off.]
[Bucky runs over the top of a speeding car, outpacing it. Black Panther is a few cars behind, keeping pace with Bucky. he leaps on the back of the 4x4 that Steve's driving. Steve swerves from side to side, trying to throw him off.]
Steve Rogers: Sam, I can't shake this guy.
Sam Wilson: Right behind you.
[Several police cars join the chase. Steve side-swipes another car and drives on.]
[Up ahead Bucky reaches a fork in the road and faces oncoming traffic. He leaps over a barrier. Steve drives through the barrier.]
[A motorbike speeds towards Bucky. Bucky grabs the handlebar and spins the bike around in mid air, throwing the rider off. Bcuky gets on the bike and rides away sending cars careering out of the way. Steve keeps on Bucky's tail with Black Panther holding onto the back of the 4x4. They all rocket through another underpass. Sam flies into the underpass. Black Panther leaps off the front of the 4x4 onto Bucky's motorbike. Bucky flings him over his head and the bike leans down on its side. Bucky kicks his assailant away, straightens up and rides on. Black Panther catches a ride on Falcon's leg. Sam tries to kick Black Panther away. Bucky throws a sticky bomb and blows up the roof at the end of the underpass, bringing down tons of rubble. Black Panther leaps off from Falcon and throws Bucky off the motorbike. Steve swerves the 4x4 through the rubble, leaps out and pulls Black Panther away from Bucky. Steve stands, facing sleek and muscular Black Panther. Armed police arrive and surround them, guns aimed. War Machine leaps down from above and raises both hands.]
James Rhodes: Stand down, now. [Bucky stands beside Steve who puts his shield on his back.] Congratulations, Cap. You're a criminal. [Police move in and force Bucky to his knees. Black Panther raises his hands. A cop moves Steve's arms behind his back. Black Panther retracts his claws and pulls off his mask revealing his face. It's T'Challa. Steve and Rhodes look curious.]
GSG-9 Soldier: Wie lautet der Befehl? (What's the order?)
James Rhodes: Your highness. [Bucky's hauled flat on the ground.]
[Avengers HQ. Vision follows a recipe.]
Vision: 'A pinch of paprika.' A pinch. [He adds a pinch. Wanda strolls in.]
Wanda Maximoff: Is that paprikash?
Vision: I thought it might . . . lift your spirits.
Wanda Maximoff: [She chuckles, stirs the ingredients in the pan with a spoon. She lifts the spoon to her lips, blows and has a taste. She smiles.] Spirits lifted.
Vision: In my defense, I haven't actually ever . . . eaten anything before, so . . .
Wanda Maximoff: May I?
Vision: Please. Wanda?
Wanda Maximoff: Hmm.
Vision: No one dislikes you, Wanda. [She frowns curiously.]
Wanda Maximoff: Thanks.
Vision: Oh, you're welcome. No, it's a . . . involuntary response in their amygdala. They can't help but be afraid of you.
Wanda Maximoff: Are you?
Vision: My amygdala is synthetic, so . . . [Wanda laughs.]
Wanda Maximoff: I used to think of myself one way. But after this . . . [her fingers glow.] I am something else. I'm still me, I think, but . . . that's not what everyone else sees.
Vision: [He touches the mind stone in his forehead.] Do you know, I don't know what this is? [It glows.] Not really. I know it's not of this world, that it powered Loki's staff, gave you your abilities, but . . . its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me.
Wanda Maximoff: Are you afraid of it?
Vision: I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day . . . who knows? I may even control it.
Wanda Maximoff: [Wanda looks at the food.] I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika. I'm gonna go to the store. I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Vision: Alternatively, we could order a pizza?
Wanda Maximoff: Vision, are you not letting me leave?
Vision: [He blocks her way.] It is a question of safety.
Wanda Maximoff: I can protect myself.
Vision: [He holds her arm.] Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a . . . more secured foundation.
Wanda Maximoff: And what do you want?
Vision: For people to see you . . . as I do. [She looks at him gravely.]
[Berlin, day. Traffic rolls around the victory column. Police convoy drives beside the river Spree. Amidst the convoy is a gray armed truck. Inside Bucky wears restraints inside a prison pod. Three armed guards sit on the other side of the glass-walled pod. A police motorbike stops traffic and a van driver looks affronted. The convoy turns a corner onto a bridge across the river. In an SUV T'Challa sits in front of Steve who sits in front of Sam.]
Sam Wilson: So, you like cats?
Steve Rogers: Sam.
Sam Wilson: What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don't wanna know more?
Steve Rogers: Your suit . . . t's Vibranium?
T'Challa: [T'Challes eyes narrow as he glances sideways.] The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend murdered my father, I also wear the mantle of king. So, I ask you . . . as both warrior and king . . . how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me? [Steve is stony faced as the convoy heads underground.]
[In a light gray walled bunker Bucky's pod is carried away by a forklift. Nearby Steve gets out of the SUV and glances across at Bucky who doesn't spot him. With Sam and T'Challa Steve approaches Sharon who's standing with a diminutive, gray-head man.]
Steve Rogers: What's gonna happen to him?
Everett Ross: Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition.
Sharon Carter: This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander.
Steve Rogers: What about our lawyer?
Everett Ross: Lawyer. That's funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. Oh, we'll write you a receipt.
Sam Wilson: I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that. [As they go Steve looks back and catches Bucky's eye.]
[On a covered sky walk.]
Everett Ross: You'll be provided with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favor, stay in it?
T'Challa: I don't intend on going anywhere.
Natasha Romanoff: For the record, this is what making things worse looks like.
Steve Rogers: He's alive.
Tony Stark: [on his phone] No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
Natasha Romanoff: Try not to break anything while we fix this.
Tony Stark: [still on the phone.] Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.
Steve Rogers: 'Consequences'?
Tony Stark: Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.
Steve Rogers: I'm not getting that shield back, am I?
Natasha Romanoff: Technically, it's the government's property. Wings, too.
Sam Wilson: That's cold.
Tony Stark: Warmer than jail.
[At a power station surrounded by trees the van with the driver who was affronted by the police convoy pulls up by the open gate. Scowling he puts the parking break on and picks up a clip board.]
Delivery Truck Driver: Das kann nicht richtig sein. Was zum Teufel? (This can't be right. What the hell?)
[In a secured chamber a guard connects a pipe to Bucky's prison pod. The lights inside dim for a moment.]
[Tony finds Steve in a glass-walled office overlooking the control room.]
Tony Stark: Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely. [Tony shows him two pens in a black presentation box.] FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.
Steve Rogers: Some would say it brought our country closer to war.
Tony Stark: See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?
Steve Rogers: Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
Tony Stark: We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . .
Steve Rogers: Pregnant?
Tony Stark: No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.
Steve Rogers: I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.
Tony Stark: A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference. [Tony stands up and paces.] In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.
Steve Rogers: You know, I'm glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single.
Tony Stark: Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.
Steve Rogers: I don't mean to make things difficult.
Tony Stark: I know, because you're a very polite person.
Steve Rogers: If I see a situation pointed south . . . I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.
Tony Stark: No, you don't.
Steve Rogers: [Steve smiles thinly.] No, I don't. Sometimes . . .
Tony Stark: Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison.
Steve Rogers: [Steve frowns thoughtfully and picks up one of the fountain pens. He stands up and paces, then turns to Tony. In the control room beyond there are multiple screens on the walls.] I'm not saying it's impossible, but there would have to be safeguards.
Tony Stark: Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . .
Steve Rogers: Wanda? What about Wanda?
Tony Stark: She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company.
Steve Rogers: Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way . . .
Tony Stark: What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.
Steve Rogers: Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony.
Tony Stark: She's not a US citizen.
Steve Rogers: Oh, come on, Tony.
Tony Stark: And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.
Steve Rogers: She's a kid!
Tony Stark: GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.
Steve Rogers: [Steve nods faintly.] You keep telling yourself that. [He puts the pen down.] Hate to break up the set. [He leaves the office and rueful Tony watches Bucky on one of the control room's screens.]
Helmut Zemo: [The evaluator sits at a desk facing Bucky's pod. Inside Bucky's still restrained.] Hello, Mr. Barnes. I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James?
Sharon Carter: [In an office with Sam and Steve.] The receipt for your gear.
Sam Wilson: 'Bird costume'? Come on.
Sharon Carter: I didn't write it. [Sharon pushes a button witch stops the restriction on the audio from Bucky's evaluation.]
Helmut Zemo: I'm not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I can't help you if you don't talk to me, James.
Bucky Barnes: My name is Bucky.
[At the power station. The van driver honks and looks impatient watching the custodian's hut's front door.]
Delivery Truck Driver: Hallo? ([subtitled] Hello?) [The custodian comes outside and the driver comes out of his van.] Hey. Ich hab eine große für dich. ([subtitled] Hey. I have a big one for you.) [He opens the van's back doors and removes a large wooden crate.] Ja. Okay, hier unterzeichnen. (Okay. Here. Just sign here.)
Custodian: Hier? (Here?)
Delivery Truck Driver: Ja. (Yeah.) [The custodian signs for the crate.]
[At the UN-bunker Steve studies the blurry photograph of the man who bombed the congress in Vienna.]
Steve Rogers: Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with?
Sharon Carter: Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?
Steve Rogers: Right. It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier.
Sharon Carter: You're saying someone framed him to find him.
Sam Wilson: Steve, we looked for the guy for two years and found nothing.
Steve Rogers: We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.
Sharon Carter: Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would. [Sharon's gaze falls on the evaluator in the screen, her eyes narrow.]
Steve Rogers: [Steve frowns and looks around.] Yeah.
Helmut Zemo: [In the secure chamber.] Tell me, Bucky. You've seen a great deal, haven't you?
Bucky Barnes: I don't want to talk about it.
Helmut Zemo: You fear that… if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don't worry. [Zemo gets a message on his screen: 'message inbox:1' touches it 'status: package delivered'.] We only have to talk about one.
[At the power station the custodian opens the crate. Finding Zemo's large device inside, he looks confused. The driver is at the back door of his van.]
Custodian: Hey, was ist das? (Hey. What is this?)
Delivery Truck Driver: Ich weiß es nicht. (I don't know.)
[The device erupts. A bubble of energy engulfs the power station and sparks fly. In the city traffic lights fail. In the bunker the lights go out.]
Everett Ross: Great. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Go.
Tony Stark: FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage.
Sharon Carter: [In the office.] Sub-level 5, east wing. [T'Challa spots Steve and Sam bolting.]
[In Bucky's pod.]
Bucky Barnes: What the hell is this?
Helmut Zemo: Why don't we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean, your real home. [Zemo removes his glasses then walks towards Bucky reading from the red book by torchlight.] Желание. ([subtitled] Longing.)
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky shuts his eyes.] No. [Bucky's head snaps back.]
Helmut Zemo: Ржавый. ([subtitled] Rusted.)
Bucky Barnes: Stop.
Helmut Zemo: Семнадцать. ([subtitled] Seventeen.)
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky's metal arm trembles in its restraint.] Stop. [He sneers angrily.]
Helmut Zemo: Рассвет. ([subtitled] Daybreak.)
[Bucky screams, clenches his fist and rips free of his restraints.]
Helmut Zemo: Печь. ([subtitled] Furnace.) Девять. ([subtitled] Nine.)
[Bucky thumps the inside of the pod.]
Helmut Zemo: Добросердечный. ([subtitled] Benign.)
[Bucky punches harder.]
Helmut Zemo: Возвращение на Родину. ([subtitled] Homecoming.) Один. ([subtitled:] One.) Грузовой вагон. ([subtitled] Freight car.)
[Bucky batteres the front of the pod with his metal fist and the glass screen flies clear. Zemo slowly rounds the pod with the book and the torch in hand. he stands before Bucky who straightens, a dark frown on his face.]
Helmut Zemo: Солдат? ([subtitled] Soldier?)
Bucky Barnes: Я готов отвечать. ([subtitled] Ready to comply.)
Helmut Zemo: Mission report. December 16, 1991.
[Steve and Sam arrive outside the chamber. Red emergency lights flash all around. There are many agents slumped on the floor. All of them out cold.]
Helmut Zemo: Help me. Help.
Steve Rogers: [Steve finds Zemo in a heap inside the chamber.] Get up. [he grabs Zemo and shoves him against the wall.] Who are you? What do you want?
Helmut Zemo: To see an empire fall.
[As Sam enters Bucky swings his fist which smashes through the wall as Sam ducks. Bucky grabs him by the jaw and throws him at the open pod. Steve lurches into the fight and lands a punch which Bucky barely feels. Bucky kicks and punches Steve out of the chamber. A punch from Bucky goes through the elevator door. Steve blocks the next one but the power of Bucky's fist sends Steve tumbling into the darkened elevator shaft.]
[In the chamber Sam comes around and spots Zemo looking down the elevator shaft.]
Man on PA #1: Der Ostflügel ist kompromittiert. Ich wiederhole: Der Ostflügel ist kompromittiert. (The east wing is compromised. I repeat: the east wing is compromised.)
Sam Wilson: Hey.
[Zemo bolts, Sam rises. At the bottom of the shaft Steve pushes himself off the floor.]
[In the control room.]
Everett Ross: Evac all civilians. Get me a perimeter around the building, and gunships in the air.
Natasha Romanoff: Please tell me you brought a suit.
Tony Stark: Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
Sharon Carter: Follow me. [Sharon runs past Tony and Natasha.]
[Sam chases Zemo up a stair well.]
[Steve starts to climb the elevator shaft.]
[Bucky stalks through the building's ground floor. He batters two guards. With tech-glasses on Tony takes cover behind a pillar.]
Natasha Romanoff: [on radio:] We're in position.
[Tony taps a wrist-control which becomes his Iron Man-glove. He zaps Bucky with a stun-burst before Bucky can shoot a guard. Tony rushes him, firing again. Bucky ducks the blast then trades blows with Tony, firing the gun. Tony has the Iron Man-glove over the barrel, blocking the bullet. He pulls the gun barrel loose then Bucky smacks him backwards. Sharon rushes Bucky, then Natasha rushes Bucky. They both land kicks and punches, then Bucky flips Sharon head over heels. She smashes onto a table then Natasha leaps on Bucky, legs around his neck. He slams her onto another table and grabs her throat.]
Natasha Romanoff: You could at least recognize me.
[T'Challa comes from nowhere and kicks Bucky off Natasha. He fights with Bucky, landing lightning fast kicks and some punches. Bucky gets a counter punch in and T'Challa falls, but quickly recovers. Bucky hurries up some stairs. T'Challa leaps the levels and vaults a railing, landing in front of Bucky. Limber T'Challa spin-kicks and grabs Bucky's metal arm which he tries to twist then looks worried as he realizes it isn't going to work. He throws Bucky backwards and keeps hold as they both tumble down the stairs. They resume fighting on the small landing and a leg sweep sends Bucky over the railing. T'Challa leaps down after him but finds the wide reception empty. He scans around.]
[Outside staff flee the building en masse. Sam is among them and quickly spots something on the ground. He picks it up.]
Sam Wilson: Damn it. [he looks around the wide courtyard and scowls.]
[Bucky's on the rooftop helipad. He marches up to a blue chopper and pulls the lock off the door. he gets in the pilot seat. Steve rushes outside and sprints toward the rising chopper. He leaps and grabs the landing gear. Muscles bulging Steve pulls hard and the chopper struggles to gain height. Steve's feet kick for traction then he gets them flat on the helipad. The chopper drags him onto the weak looking mesh framing the helipad. Steve grabs the railing with one hand and clings to the landing gear with the other. He grits his teeth and his neck strains with the incredible effort. Bucky glowers from inside the chopper then throws the joystick left and the chopper's nose slams into the edge of the helipad. The rotor-blades are smashed to pieces and Steve ducks as the tail swings around. The chopper lies twisted on the mesh at the edge of the pad. Steve rises beside the canopy. Bucky's arm smashes through the glass and growling he grabs Steve's throat. The chopper starts to list over the edge. The tail breaks off and falls into the river below. Bucky keeps hold of Steve as the whole vehicle drops and slams into the river. The impact seems to knock Bucky out cold and he lets go of Steve. The body of the chopper sinks quickly to the riverbed along with other debris. Steve surfaces with Bucky in his arms.]
[At an airport Zemo listens to a phone message.:]
Zemo's Wife: He asked me again if you were going to be there. I said I wasn't sure. You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.
[Frowning Zemo ends the call. A TV news report is playing nearby:]
News anchor #5: James Barnes, der mit dem Bombenanschlag auf die UN in Wien in Verbindung gebracht wird, ist heute aus der Haft entflohen. Ebenfalls vermisst werden die Avengers Captain Steve Rogers und Sam Wilson. ([subtitled:] James Barnes, the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing escaped custody today. Also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson.)
[Zemo eyes the TV screen. He stands in line at a departures gate. The screen above the gate reads: 'Gate 06 | Berlin Flughafen | AEM2103 | 14:10 | Moskau/Moscow']
[In a huge abandoned warehouse Bucky comes to with his metallic left arm clamped in a huge industrial vice. Steve peers through a gap at a chopper flying overhead. Sam's over by Bucky.]
Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap! [Steve goes over to join Sam by Bucky who sits with his arm in the vice. They stare at him.]
Bucky Barnes: Steve.
Steve Rogers: Which Bucky am I talking to?
Bucky Barnes: Your mom's name was Sarah...You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.
Steve Rogers: Can't read that in a museum.
Sam Wilson: Just like that, we're suppose to be cool?
Bucky Barnes: What did I do?
Steve Rogers: Enough.
Bucky Barnes: Oh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All he had to do was say the goddamn words.
Steve Rogers: Who was he?
Bucky Barnes: I don't know.
Steve Rogers: People are dead. The bombing, the setup. The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you. I need you to do better than "I don't know."
Bucky Barnes: He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where.
Steve Rogers: Why would he need to know that?
Bucky Barnes: Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.
[1991, at night Bucky rides alongside the car and somehow causes the car to crash. He circles back, pulls up and climbs off the motorbike. he's filmed on CCTV as he approaches the car's trunk. He janks it open, breaking the lock. Inside he opens a metal case which contains five clear drip bags filled with bright blue fluid.]
[Four young men and a young woman sit up in hospital beds. The blue fluid is fed intravenously into their arms. The drip bags hang on stands beside them. They're all fit and muscular. One man, Josef, flexes a huge biceps. Josef is screaming, dragged into a cell and left on a bed.]
Josef / Super Soldier #1: It hurts! [He struggles in leather bindings. A viewing slot is closed.]
[Karpov is sitting at a desk in a corridor, making notes and listening. Karpov opens the door to a lab and switches on the light. Josef is sitting on a bed. He looks up at Karpov.]
[Bucky and Josef fight each other in a barred chamber. The four others who were given the blue liquid are there. Josef kicks with enormous power, sending Bucky flying. Watching Karpov folds his arms.
Vasily Karpov: Очень хорошо, Иосиф. ([subtitled] Good work.)
[A medic takes Josef's pulse and Josef slams him onto the floor. A soldier clubs Josef onto the back with no effect. Karpov gets behind Bucky and aims a gun.]
Vasily Karpov: Солдат, вытащи меня отсюда! ([subtitled] Get me out of here.)
[Josef and the other four Winter Soldiers effortlessly dispatch a squad of Soldiers. Bucky escorts covering Karpov from the barred chamber, batting guards aside.]
Steve Rogers: Who were they?
Bucky Barnes: Their most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum.
Sam Wilson: They all turn out like you?
Bucky Barnes: Worse.
Steve Rogers: The doctor, could he control them?
Bucky Barnes: Enough.
Steve Rogers: Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
Bucky Barnes: With these guys he could do it. They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize, They can take a whole country down in one night. You'd never see them coming.
Sam Wilson: [Sam steps up to Steve.] This would have been a lot easier a week ago.
Steve Rogers: If we call Tony . . .
Sam Wilson: No, he won't believe us.
Steve Rogers: Even if he did . . .
Sam Wilson: Who knows if the Accords would let him help.
Steve Rogers: We're on our own.
Sam Wilson: Maybe not. I know a guy.
Secretary Ross: I don't suppose you have any idea where they are?
Tony Stark: We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
Secretary Ross: You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle. It's clear you can't be objective. I'm putting Special Ops on this.
Natasha Romanoff: What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers?
Secretary Ross: If we're provoked. Barnes would've been eliminated in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math.
Tony Stark: All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in.
Secretary Ross: How would that end any differently from the last time?
Tony Stark: Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed.
Secretary Ross: 36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson.
Tony Stark: Thank you, sir. [Tony rubs his hand on his chest and slumps, exhaling.] My left arm is numb, is that normal?
Natasha Romanoff: [She pats him on the shoulder.] You alright?
Tony Stark: Always. [He has a massive black eye and a cut on his brow.] 36 hours, jeez.
Natasha Romanoff: We're seriously understaffed.
Tony Stark: Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
Natasha Romanoff: No. You really think he'd be on our side?
Tony Stark: No.
Natasha Romanoff: I have an idea.
Tony Stark: Me too. Where's yours?
Natasha Romanoff: Downstairs. Where's yours? [Tony smiles slightly.]
[Queens, New York. Peter Parker walks out of an elevator holding a DVD-player and with a backpack on his shoulder. He walks into an apartment where his Aunt May is sitting on the couch with Tony Stark.]
Peter Parker: Hey, May.
May Parker: Mmm. Hey. How was school today?
Peter Parker: Okay. This crazy car parked outside . . . [Peter sees Tony and his eyes widen.]
Tony Stark: Oh, Mr. Parker.
Peter Parker: Um . . . [He takes out his earphones.] What--what are you doing . . .? Hey! Uh, I'm--Im--I'm Peter.
Tony Stark: Tony.
Peter Parker: What are . . .what are you--what are you--what are you doing here?
Tony Stark: It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?
Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah.
Tony Stark: Right?
Peter Parker: Regarding the . . .
May Parker: You didn't tell me about the grant.
Peter Parker: About the grant.
Tony Stark: The September Foundation.
Peter Parker: Right.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Remember when you applied?
Peter Parker: Yeah.
Tony Stark: I approved, so now we're in business.
May Parker: You didn't tell me anything. What's up with that? You keeping secrets from me now?
Peter Parker: Why, I just, I just . . . I just know how much you love surprises, so I thought I would let you know . . . wh . . . anyway, what did I apply for?
Tony Stark: That's what I'm here to hash out.
Peter Parker: Okay. Hash, hash out, okay.
Tony Stark: It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.
May Parker: Yeah, well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know?
Tony Stark: This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
Peter Parker: Let me just stop you there.
Tony Stark: Yeah?
Peter Parker: Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Peter Parker: Yeah?
Tony Stark: It's pretty well funded.
Peter Parker: Wow.
Tony Stark: Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?
May Parker: Sure.
Tony Stark: [In Peter's bedroom Tony bolts the door and spits out the walnut loaf.] As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad. [He notices Peter's collection of old computers.] Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?
Peter Parker: Uh, the garbage, actually.
Tony Stark: You're a dumpster diver.
Peter Parker: Yeah, I was . . . anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant.
Tony Stark: Ah-ah! Me first.
Peter Parker: Okay.
Tony Stark: Quick question of the rhetorical variety. [He pulls out his phone which projects a video of Peter Parker in his Spider-Man outfit.] That's you, right?
Peter Parker: Um, no. What do you. What do you mean?
Tony Stark: Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That's not easy. You got mad skills.
Peter Parker: That's all- That's all on YouTube, though, right? I mean, that's where you found that? Because you know that's all fake. It's all done on the computer.
Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.
Peter Parker: It's like that video. What is it?
Tony Stark: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . . . oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?
Peter Parker: Exactly.
Tony Stark: Oh, what have we here?
Peter Parker: [Peter hides his Spider-Man suit.] Uh . . . that's a . . .
Tony Stark: So. You're the . . . Spider . . . ling. Crime-fighting Spider . . .you're Spider-Boy?
Peter Parker: [Peter folds his arms petulantly.] S . . . Spider-Man.
Tony Stark: Not in that onesie, you're not.
Peter Parker: It's not a onesie. [Tony picks up the suit.] I don't believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and . . . Algebra test. Nailed it!
Tony Stark: Who else knows? Anybody?
Peter Parker: Nobody.
Tony Stark: Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?
Peter Parker: No. No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out.
Tony Stark: You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?
Peter Parker: I did.
Tony Stark: Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves?
Peter Parker: It's a long story. I was uh . . .
Tony Stark: Lordy! Can you even see in these?
Peter Parker: Yes. Yes, I can! I can. I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that… when whatever happened, happened . . . it's like my senses have been dialed to 11. There's way too much input, so . . . they just kinda help me focus.
Tony Stark: You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here. [Peter sits on his bed and looks at Tony.] Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?
Peter Parker: Because . . . [he fiddles with his fingers] because l've been me my whole life, and l've had these powers for 6 months.
Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.
Peter Parker: I read books, I build computers . . . and--and yeah. I would love to play football. But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now.
Tony Stark: Sure, because you're different.
Peter Parker: Exactly. But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don't . . . [Tony leans closer.] and then the bad things happen . . . they happen because of you.
Tony Stark: [he looks affected by Peter's words.] So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?
Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah just looking out . . . for the little guy. That's--that's what it is.
Tony Stark: [He slowly steps over to Peter whose leg is stretched out on the bed. Tony looks down at it.] I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg. [Peter moves along. Tony sits beside him and raises his hand. He hesitantly clasps Peter's shoulder.] You got a passport?
Peter Parker: Uh, no. I don't even have a driver's license.
Tony Stark: You ever been to Germany?
Peter Parker: No.
Tony Stark: Oh, you'll love it.
Peter Parker: I can't go to Germany!
Tony Stark: Why?
Peter Parker: I got . . . homework.
Tony Stark: I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
Peter Parker: I'm---I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!
Tony Stark: Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.
Peter Parker: [He webs Tony's hand to the door.] Don't tell Aunt May.
Tony Stark: Alright, Spider-Man. [They share an earnest look before Tony returns to his usual attitude.] Get me out of this.
Peter Parker: Sorry, I'll get the . . .
[Night, at Avengers' HQ. Vision floats above the floor. An explosion in the distance lights up the room for a moment. Vision and Wanda look out of the window.]
Wanda Maximoff: What is it?
Vision: Stay here, please.
[Vision goes. Suddenly Wanda compels a knife across the room. It stops dead in front of Clint's head.]
Clint Barton: Guess I shoulda knocked.
Wanda Maximoff: Oh my god! What are you doing here?
Clint Barton: Disappointing my kids. [He shoots arrows to both sides of the room.] I'm supposed to go water-skiing. Cap needs our help. Come on.
Vision: Clint! [Wanda and Clint stop.] You should not be here.
Clint Barton: [He turns around.] Really? I retire for, what, like five minutes, and it all goes to shit.
Vision: Please consider the consequences of your actions.
Clint Barton: Okay, they're considered. Okay, we gotta go. [Vision is held in a force field, crackling and sparkling between the two arrows.] It's this way.
Wanda Maximoff: I've caused enough problems.
Clint Barton: [Frowning Clint runs back from the door.] You gotta help me, Wanda. Look, you wanna mope, can go to high school. You wanna make amends, you get off your ass. Shit. [Vision breaks the force field with his mind stone. He punches Clint to the floor, Clint recovers quickly.] I knew I should've stretched. [He extends a baton and tries to hit Vision, but the blows go through him. Clint resorts to punches, then tries the baton again. It breaks. Clint tries to kick Vision, but his leg goes right through him. Vision gets Clint in a headlock.]
Vision: Clint, you can't overpower me.
Clint Barton: I know I can't. But she can.
Wanda Maximoff: Vision, that's enough. Let him go. I'm leaving.
Vision: I can't let you.
Wanda Maximoff: [She holds her hands apart, glowing with energy. Clint slips from Vision's grasp.] I'm sorry.
Vision: [He falters.] If you do this . . . they will never stop being afraid of you.
Wanda Maximoff: I can't control their fear, only my own. [She moves closer. Vision glows from within and crashes through the floor, and several floors beneath. Wanda and Clint stand over the holes in the floors.]
Clint Barton: Oh . . . come on. We got one more stop.
[Back at the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre:]
Attache: It's just a matter of time. Our satellites are running facial, bio-metric, and behavioral pattern scans.
Security Chief: [to Natasha who's standing in their way] Move, or you will be moved.
T'Challa: As entertaining as that would be . . .
Natasha Romanoff: You really think you can find him?
T'Challa: My resources are considerable.
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes . . . so you could probably do that in about half the time.
T'Challa: You know where they are.
Natasha Romanoff: I know someone who does.
[Under an overpass:]
Sharon Carter: Not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car.
Steve Rogers: It's low profile.
Sharon Carter: Good, because this stuff tends to draw a crowd. [She opens the trunk of her car, revealing Steve's and Sams's gear.]
Bucky Barnes: [He sits behind Sam in the getaway car.] Can you move your seat up?
Sam Wilson: No.
Steve Rogers: I owe you again.
Sharon Carter: Keeping a list. [She glances at Bucky.] You know, he kinda tried to kill me.
Steve Rogers: Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too. They're going to come looking for you.
Sharon Carter: I know.
[They kiss.]
Steve Rogers: Thank you, Sharon.
Sharon Carter: That was . . .
Steve Rogers: Late.
Sharon Carter: Damn right. I should go.
Steve Rogers: Okay.
[On the 6th level of a parking garage at the Leipzig/Halle airport. Steve drives into the parking lot in the battered, old car. He parks by a grey van and gets out.]
Clint Barton: Cap.
Steve Rogers: You know I wouldn't have called If I had any other choice.
Clint Barton: Hey man, you're doing me a favor. Besides, I owe a debt.
Steve Rogers: Thanks for having my back.
Wanda Maximoff: It was time to get off my ass.
Steve Rogers: How about our other recruit?
Clint Barton: He's rarin' to go. Had to put a little coffee in him, but… he should be good.
Scott Lang: What timezone is this?
Clint Barton: Come on. Come on.
Scott Lang: [Scott shakes Steve's hand with an amazed look.] Captain America.
Steve Rogers: Mr. Lang.
Scott Lang: It's an honor. I'm shaking your hand too long. Wow! This is awesome! Captain America. [He looks at Wanda.] I know you, too. You're great! [He turns back and feels Steve's shoulders.] Jeez. Ah, look, I wanna say, I know you know a lot of super people, so . . . thinks for thanking of me. [(sic!) To Sam.] Hey, man!
Sam Wilson: What's up, Tic Tac?
Scott Lang: Uh, good to see you. Look, what happened last time when I . . .
Sam Wilson: It was a great audition, but it'll . . . it'll never happen again.
Steve Rogers: They tell you what we're up against?
Scott Lang: Something about some . . . psycho-assassins?
Steve Rogers: We're outside the law on this one. So, if you come with us, you're a wanted man.
Scott Lang: Yeah, well, what else is new?
Bucky Barnes: We should get moving.
Clint Barton: We got a chopper lined up.
Man on PA #2: Dies ist eine Notsituation. Alle Passagiere müssen den Flughafen sofort evakuieren. (This is an emergency. All passengers must evacuate the airport immediately.)
Bucky Barnes: They're evacuating the airport.
Sam Wilson: Stark.
Scott Lang: Stark?
Steve Rogers: Suit up.
[Steve in his uniform strides through an underpass, then jogs onto a private runway, heading for a grounded chopper. An electro-disabler slams onto the chopper and Steve looks up. Iron Man and War Machine decent.]
Tony Stark: Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. Don't you think that's weird?
James Rhodes: Definitely weird.
Steve Rogers: Hear me out, Tony. That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this.
T'Challa: [T'Challa leaps over a truck.] Captain.
Steve Rogers: Your highness.
Tony Stark: Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?
Steve Rogers: You're after the wrong guy.
Tony Stark: Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.
Steve Rogers: And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't.
Natasha Romanoff: Steve . . . you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one?
Tony Stark: All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos! [Peter shoots a web, stealing Steve's shield and binding his hands.] Nice job, kid.
Peter Parker: Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better. It's just the new suit… Well, it's nothing, Mr. Stark. It's--it's perfect. Thank you.
Tony Stark: Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.
Peter Parker: Okay. Cap . . . Captain. Big fan, I'm Spider-Man.
Tony Stark: Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just . . .
Peter Parker: Hey, everyone.
Tony Stark: . . . Good job.
Steve Rogers: You've been busy.
Tony Stark: And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.
Steve Rogers: You did that when you signed.
Tony Stark: Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite. [Steve looks aside.] Come on.
Sam Wilson: [He radios Steve.] We found it. Their Quinjet's in hanger five, north runway.
Steve Rogers: [Steve holds his hands up and Clint shoots the web off.] Alright, Lang.
Peter Parker: Hey, guys, something . . .
James Rhodes: Whoa. What--what the hell was that?
Scott Lang: [He retrieves Steve's shield.] I believe this is yours, Captain America.
Tony Stark: Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?
James Rhodes: Got two in the terminal, Wilson and Barnes.
T'Challa: Barnes is mine!
Peter Parker: Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?
Tony Stark: What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.
Peter Parker: Okay, copy that!
T'Challa: Move, Captain. I won't ask a second time.
Scott Lang: [He faces Natasha.] Look, I really don't want to hurt you.
Natasha Romanoff: I wouldn't stress about it. [She kicks him in the groin and he miniaturizes, throwing her head over heels. She zaps him off her wrist and he slams into a nearby truck, laving a small dent.]
Bucky Barnes: [In the terminal.] What the hell is that?
Sam Wilson: Everyone's got a gimmick now.
Peter Parker: [Peter swings through the glass wall and kicks Sam backwards. Bucky throws a punch, Peter catches his fist.] You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude! [Sam hits Peter.] You have the right to remain silent! [Mid-air Peter fends Sam off, then swings after him using his webs.]
[Iron Man shoots rockets that explode just beyond Clint and Wanda.]
[Steve fights hand to hand with T'Challa. War Machine locks on.]
James Rhodes: Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either. [He smacks Steve's shield with a mace.]
Tony Stark: [Hovering above the ground.] Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
Wanda Maximoff: You locked me in my room.
Tony Stark: Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint.
Clint Barton: Hey, man.
Tony Stark: Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?
Clint Barton: Well, I played 18, I shot 18. Just can't seem to miss. [He fires an arrow which Tony deflects.]
Tony Stark: First time for everything.
Clint Barton: Made you look.
[Suddenly a car slams past Iron Man. He looks up as dozens more come crashing down. Wanda rows her glowing hands until Iron Man is buried under a pile of cars.]
FRIDAY: Multiple contusions detected.
Tony Stark: Yeah, I detected that too.
[Peter wings through the rafters in the terminal, chasing Sam who flies backwards firing shots. Peter stops on a high beam.]
Peter Parker: Oh god. [Bucky throws something at him.] Hey buddy, I think you lost this! [Peter throws it back. Sam kicks him off the beam and Peter fires a web which sends Sam crashing to the floor. Peter webs Sam's wrist to a balcony railing.] Those wings carbon fiber?
Sam Wilson: Is this stuff coming out of you?
Peter Parker: That would explain the rigidity-flexibility ratio, which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.
Sam Wilson: I don't know if you've been a fight before but there's usually not this much talking.
Peter Parker: Alright, sorry, my bad. [He swings down and Bucky jumps in the way. Bucky and Sam fall through the glass down onto the next floor and Peter webs them.] Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up but I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark, so, I'm really sorry. [Redwing drags Peter through the glass wall.] Wwahhhh!
Bucky Barnes: You couldn't have done that earlier?
Sam Wilson: I hate you.
[Outside Steve kicks War Machine out of the air, then sends T'Challa reeling. War Machine's mace is broken.]
James Rhodes: Great.
Scott Lang: Hey, Cap, heads up! [He throws Steve a miniature truck.] Throw it at this. Now! [Steve throws it and the truck enlarges, tumbling towards War Machine.]
James Rhodes: Oh, come on! [The truck lands and explodes.]
Scott Lang: Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck. Uh . . . sorry. [Scott and Steve run off.]
James Rhodes: Alright. Now, I'm pissed.
Natasha Romanoff: [Tony helps her up.] Is this, part of the plan?
Tony Stark: Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?
Clint Barton: [To Wanda as he spots the Quinjet.] There's our ride.
Steve Rogers: Come on!
[Steve's team runs towards the Quinjet. A fizzing stream of energy slices across the runway and they stop. Vision hovers overhead.]
Vision: Captain Rogers. I know you believe what you're doing is right. But for the collective good you must surrender now. [Tony's team arrives.]
Sam Wilson: What do we do, Cap?
Steve Rogers: We fight.
Natasha Romanoff: This is gonna end well. [The two teams stride towards each other with grim determination etched on their faces.]
Peter Parker: They're not stopping.
Tony Stark: Neither are we. [Everyone breaks into a sprint.]
[Steve blocks a punch as Iron Man lands. Clint fires an arrow at Vision. War Machine flies after Falcon and Bucky trades blows with T'Challa. An explosive arrow hits Iron Man. Natasha throws Scott, as Peter swings through the air, struggling to evade vehicles projected by Wanda. Bucky lands punches on T'Challa, Clint and Natasha battle with batons. Clint pins her down with his bow.]
Natasha Romanoff: We're still friends, right?
Clint Barton: Depends on how hard you hit me. [She spins him with her legs. As she's about to kick his head, her foot stops and glows bright red. Wanda projects Natasha down.]
Wanda Maximoff: You were pulling your punches. [Clint nods sheepishly.]
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky and T'Challa have each other by the throat.] I didn't kill your father.
T'Challa: Then why did you run? [T'Challa pulls Bucky's hand off his neck, then spins him and fly-kicks him backwards. He sprouts claws and aims for Bucky's neck, but Wanda stops his hand, then waves her arms and sends T'Challa crashing into a passenger gangway.]
[Peter swings past, Steve snaps the web with his shield.]
Peter Parker: That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.
Steve Rogers: Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.
Peter Parker: Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow. [he fires webs which stick to Steve's shield and ankle. He pulls and Steve slides towards him. Peter kicks him backwards, then rolls clear.] He also said to go for your legs. [As Steve runs to get his shield, Peter webs his hands and pulls. Steve grits his teeth, spins and somersaults, propelling Peter through the air.]
Sam Wilson: [Evading fire from Iron Man.] Clint, can you get him off me?
Clint Barton: Buckled in?
Scott Lang: Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go. Let's go! [Miniaturized Scott is on the tip of Clint's arrow. As he fires it, the head splits and Iron Man shoots the shards. Scott dives between Iron Man's splayed fingers and slips inside the Iron Man Suit at the shoulder joint.]
Steve Rogers: [Steve catches a web and tugs Peter towards him, knocking him down with the shield. Peter recovers and pulls himself up on top of a gangway.] Stark tell you anything else?
Peter Parker: That you're wrong. You think you're right. That makes you dangerous. [He swings down and Steve leaps to kick him backwards onto the gangway's leg.]
Steve Rogers: Guess he had a point. [He throws his shield at the leg and the gangway falls. Peter holds it up.] You got heart, kid. Where're you from?
Peter Parker: Queens.
Steve Rogers: Brooklyn. [Steve leaves Peter holding the gangway.]
Tony Stark: [Clint fires arrows at hovering Iron Man whose arm-lasers malfunction.] Friday?
FRIDAY: We have some weapon systems offline.
Tony Stark: They what?
Scott Lang: Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop.
Tony Stark: Who's speaking?
Scott Lang: It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days.
Tony Stark: Friday?
FRIDAY: Deploying fire suppression system.
Scott Lang: Uh -oh. Oh boy. Whoa! [Inside the suit Scott sprints through narrow banks of components, chased by a rolling cloud of CO2. He's ejected from the suit.]
Bucky Barnes: [To Steve.] We gotta go. That guy's probably in Siberia by now.
Steve Rogers: We gotta draw out the flyers. I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.
Sam Wilson: No, you get to the jet! Both of you! [Being chased by War Machine.] The rest of us aren't getting out of here.
Clint Barton: As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it.
Sam Wilson: This isn't the real fight, Steve.
Steve Rogers: Alright, Sam, what's the play?
Sam Wilson: We need a diversion, something big.
Scott Lang: I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half . . . don't come back for me.
Bucky Barnes: He's gonna tear himself in half?
Steve Rogers: You're sure about this, Scott?
Scott Lang: I do it all the time. I mean once . . . in a lab. Then I passed out. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the BOSS! [He leaps from mobile stairs and lands on War Machine's back as he flies past. He operates his suit's wrist, shuts his eyes and activates a remote. Scott grows into a towering Behemoth and grabs War Machine's leg.]
Peter Parker: Holy shit!
James Rhodes: Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.
Steve Rogers: I guess that's the signal.
Sam Wilson: Way to go, Tic Tac!
Tony Stark: Give me back my Rhodey. [Sam flies feet first into Iron Man.]
Peter Parker: I got him! [Scott sends War Machine flying and Peter catches him with a web.]
[Scott kicks a bus towards T'Challa. Vision descends and braces himself, splitting the bus in two and protecting T'Challa from harm. T'Challa spots Steve and Bucky sprinting past. Chasing Sam Iron Man evades Scott swinging the wing of a plane at him.]
Tony Stark: Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion.
[Sam arrows towards Iron Man, firing Red Wing which cracks into Tony's helmet. Scott blocks T'Challa's path.]
Scott Lang: You wanna get to them… you gotta go through me. [He sweeps his gigantic foot through the crates T'Challa's standing on, smashing them to pieces. Scott is engulfed in explosions as War Machine swoops towards him with Peter clinging to a web stuck to War Machine's back. He fires more webs and wraps them around Scott's over-sized arms.]
[Clint fires arrows at T'Challa who catches two right in front of his face. After the arrowheads explode he drops them and rises extending his claws.]
Clint Barton: We haven't met yet. [He flattens his bow and spins it around.] I'm Clint.
T'Challa: I don't care. [Wielding the bow like a staff Clint attacks T'Challa who a acrobatically ducks then counters with a high kick.]
[Giant Ant-Man punches War Machine in the air and swings a gangway towards him as he recovers. War Machine opens fire and the gangway disintegrates. Scott tries to stamp on War Machine who dives clear evading a lunge of Scott's hand. War Machine is struck by something.]
James Rhodes: Ahhh! [Wanda waves her hands flinging vehicles into War Machines path.]
Scott Lang: Get off. [Distracted by Peter Ant-Man doesn't spot Vision curling into a ball and ramming into him. Vision spots Steve and Bucky approaching the hangar as Ant-Man wavers. He simply floats through Ant-Man's chest. Something just flew in me! [Vision fires a shining beam of energy from his mind stone and the control tower collapses towards the entrance of the hangar. Wanda struggles to slow its collapse. Then War Machine descends behind her fires a sonic disruptor. Wanda holds her head and screams. The tower falls all around Steve and Bucky, but they make it into the hangar where Natasha is waiting for them.]
Natasha Romanoff: You're not gonna stop.
Steve Rogers: You know I can't.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm gonna regret this. [She stuns T'Challa who's arrived behind them.] Go. [Steve and Bucky run for the Quinjet as she keeps T'Challa at bay.]
Peter Parker: [Outside] Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back?
James Rhodes: Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?
Tony Stark: I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side.
Peter Parker: [He swings towards Ant-Man.] You know that part . . . where they're on the snow planet . . . with the walking thingies? [He wraps webs around Scott's legs.]
Tony Stark: Maybe the kid's on to something.
James Rhodes: High now, Tony. Go high.
Peter Parker: [He swings around and around Ant-Man's legs as Iron Man and War Machine power towards his head, both landing blows together.] YES! Ha ha! That was awesome! [Giant Ant-Man topples. A flailing limb catching Peter and knocking him flying just before Scott slams into the ground on his back. He returns to normal size and removes the face-plate of his helmet, grimacing.]
Scott Lang: Does anyone have any orange slices?
Tony Stark: [He lands by Peter who's in a heap. Retracting the helmet Tony looks concerned.] Kid, you alright?
Peter Parker: Hey! Get off me!
Tony Stark: Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
Peter Parker: Oh. Hey, man.
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Peter Parker: That was scary.
Tony Stark: Yeah. You're done. Alright?
Peter Parker: What?
Tony Stark: You did a good job. Stay down.
Peter Parker: No, I'm good. I'm fine.
Tony Stark: Stay down.
Peter Parker: No, it's good I gotta get him back!
Tony Stark: You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!
Peter Parker: Wait. Mr. Stark, wait! I'm not done, I'm not . . . [He slumps down.] Okay, I'm done. I'm done.
Natasha Romanoff: [In the partially wrecked hangar the Quinjet's engines fire and the guns blast debris from the entrance. Natasha keeps T'Challa held until the jet rises. Black Panther leaps, but can't keep hold and the Quinjet flies out of the hangar. War Machine flies after it. In the hangar:] I said I'd help you find him, not catch him. There's a difference.
Vision: [Outside Vision kneels beside Wanda and gently holds her in his arms. She pants for breath.] I'm sorry.
Wanda Maximoff: Me, too.
Vision: It's as I said. Catastrophe.
[Piloting the Quinjet, Steve looks over his shoulder and spots War Machine encroaching to the right. Steve pushes forward on the thrusters. Iron Man flies beside War Machine and Falcon follows them.]
James Rhodes: Vision, I got a bandit on my six. [Falcon fires small explosives which erupt and buffet War Machine.] Vision! You copy? Target his thrusters, turn him into a glider.
[Vision takes aim and fires his head laser. Falcon spots it coming and tucks into a tumble. The laser overshoots and slices through the core on War Machines chest plate. War Machine loses power and goes into a spinning free fall.]
Tony Stark: Rhodey! [Iron Man and Falcon dive.]
James Rhodes: Tony, I'm flying dead stick. [As he plunges the suit emits black smoke. Iron Man swoops down towards him. Rhodes' eyes start to close.]
Tony Stark: RHODES! [Mar Machine smacks into a wide, grassy field just before Iron Man lands nearby. His helmet retracts and he pulls off War Machine's face plate. Rhodes' eyes are closed and there's blood on his face.] Read vitals.
FRIDAY: Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way.
Sam Wilson: [He swoops down and lands on his feet. His wings retract.] I'm sorry. [Tony zaps Falcon backwards with a blast of energy from the palm of his suit. Vision glides to the ground just in front of Falcon. Stony faced Tony remains with his arms around War Machine.]
[Somewhere in Siberia, Zemo makes a phone call.]
German Innkeeper: Guten Morgen, Zimmerservice? (Good morning. Room service.)
Helmut Zemo: Guten Morgen Frau Leiber. Zimmer 201 hier (Good morning, Mrs. Leiber. [subtitled] This is room 201.)
German Innkeeper: Ah, Herr Müller. Speck und schwarzer Kaffee für Sie, ja? (Ah, Mr. Müller. [subtitled] Bacon and black coffee again today?)
Helmut Zemo: Wie gut Sie mich kennen. ([subtitled] You know me so well.)
[In his room in Berlin, Germany.]
German Innkeeper: Hallo? Ihr Frühstück ist hier. Darf ich mich reinlassen? Herr Müller? Herr Müller? Oh mein Gott! ([subtitled] Hello? Your breakfast is here. May I let myself in? Mr Müller? Mr Müller? Oh God!) [She comes in and discovers the dead body of Dr. Theo Broussard in the bathtub.]
[Steve flies the Quinjet towards mountains, Bucky sits behind him.]
Bucky Barnes: What's gonna happen to your friends?
Steve Rogers: [Steve stares ahead, heavyhearted. He sighs and shakes his head.] Whatever it is… I'll deal with it.
Bucky Barnes: [He looks thoughtful.] I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.
Steve Rogers: [He glances around at Bucky.] What you did all those years . . . it wasn't you. You didn't have a choice.
Bucky Barnes: I know. But I did it.
[At a hospital Rhodes lies inside an CT-scanner. He's in a blue gown covering his body. Tony paces up to Vision who watches Rhodes grave faced.]
Tony Stark: How did this happen?
Vision: I became distracted.
Tony Stark: I didn't think that was possible.
Vision: Neither did I. [Tony leaves Vision looking in on Rhodes. Along the corridor Tony spots an equally concerned Natasha.]
[Tony and Natasha stand on a balcony looking towards a row of trees.]
Tony Stark: The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.
Natasha Romanoff: Steve's not gonna stop. If you don't either, Rhodey's gonna be the best case scenario.
Tony Stark: You let them go, Nat.
Natasha Romanoff: We played this wrong.
Tony Stark: 'We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA.
Natasha Romanoff: Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for one goddamn second?
Tony Stark: T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm not the one that needs to watch their back. [She walks away.]
Tony Stark: [He activates holographic images appearing on his wrist device.] What am I looking at, Friday?
FRIDAY: Priority upload from Berlin police.
Tony Stark: Fire up the chopper.
[Tony flies over a stormy sea in the chopper. He looks surveillance images on a tablet computer.]
FRIDAY: The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man.
Tony Stark: Did you run facial recognition yet?
FRIDAY: What do I look like?
Tony Stark: Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head.
FRIDAY: You must be thinking of someone else.
Tony Stark: Must be.
FRIDAY: The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence. [Tony projects the image.] Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad.
Tony Stark: So, what happened to the real Broussard?
FRIDAY: He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.
Tony Stark: Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.
FRIDAY: Yes, Boss.
[A wide and flat, snow covered landscape. A mountain looms on the horizon. A caterpillar truck stops on the windswept mountain plateau. Zemo gets out of the vehicle. Set on rocks is an entrance with huge, rusted double doors. Zemo hacks away at the wall beside the doors. he uncovers a control panel and keys in a code whilst referring to the red book. The huge, curved double doors break open a crack. Zemo pulls them open wider. He shines a flash light and pulls down the hood of his coat.
Inside is a vast, gloomy space cramped with shelves stacked with filing boxes. Zemo moves a ladder along and searches the boxes. he climbs up the ladder and removes a filing box labeled: 'декабря 1991' (December 1991).
Zemo walks along a tunnel which opens into a cavernous chamber with a high ceiling. He carries a VHS cassette and a flash light. Standing around the chamber a five large, clear sided capsules. They glow a gold yellow inside. Frowning Zemo walks up to one of the capsules and shines his flash light inside. In the capsule, motionless in a state of suspended animation is the enhanced soldier Josef.]
[Tony flies the shopper low over the broiling sea. He operates the chopper with a touch screen computer in a wall panel.]
Guard: [on radio] This is the Raft Prison Control. You're clear for landing, Mr. Stark.
[The sea swells and surges as Raft Prison rises up from beneath. A huge, fortified, circular structure with small lights around the sides. Two semi-circular doors open up in the flat circular top. The chopper lands on a helipad and the doors close above it. Tony, who's left arm is in a sling walks up to Secretary Ross.]
Tony Stark: So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
Secretary Ross: You seriously think I'm gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You're lucky you're not in one of these cells. [Ross looks at Tony sternly and leads on through a thick, steel security door. Soldiers stand guard in an operations room. Tony looks at a surveillance screen. it shows Wanda, sitting hunched and bedraggled in a cramped prison cell.]
[Another security door opens. Tony walks into a chamber surrounded by large, bared windows. Beyond the windows are a number of prison cells. Tony takes in his surroundings.]
Clint Barton: [clapping] The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what's best for you, whether your like it or not.
Tony Stark: Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on.
Clint Barton: [spits] Yeah, well, you knew they'd put us somewhere, Tony.
Tony Stark: Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . .
Clint Barton: Criminals? [He stands up.] Criminals, Tony. Think that's the word you're looking for. [He eyes Tony through the bars.] Right? That didn't used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are.
Tony Stark: Because you broke the law.
Clint Barton: Yeah.
Tony Stark: I didn't make you.
Clint Barton: La, la, la, la, la . . .
Tony Stark: You read it, you broke it.
Clint Barton: La, la, la, la la…
Tony Stark: Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side? [He walks away.]
Clint Barton: You gotta watch your back with this guy. There's a chance he's gonna break it.
Scott Lang: Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark.
Tony Stark: Who are you?
Scott Lang: Come on, man.
Sam Wilson: How's Rhodes?
Tony Stark: They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. [Sam shakes his head.]What do you need? They feed you yet?
Sam Wilson: [He raises his eyebrows.] You're the good cop now?
Tony Stark: I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.
Sam Wilson: Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me.
Tony Stark: Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment.
Secretary Ross: [In the operations room.] What did you do? Get it back up!
Tony Stark: [Back in the cell.] Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes. [He shoes a holographic image of Doctor Broussard.] Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.
Sam Wilson: That's a first.
Tony Stark: Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to…
Sam Wilson: Hey, it's alright. [Tony leans closer to the window. Sam sighs and looks uneasy.] Look, I'll tell you… but you have to go alone and as a friend.
Tony Stark: Easy.
[Tony walks to his chopper.]
Secretary Ross: Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers?
Tony Stark: Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink. [Ross stares at Tony who smiles as he gets in the chopper and the door slides shut. The chopper rises off the helipad and flies away. The doors close on the prison roof.]
[Sitting in the chopper Tony un-clips the sling holding his left arm. He cradles his arm in his hand for a moment. He slowly reaches out the injured arm and presses a button on a panel. The Iron Man Suit wraps itself around Tony, a hatch opens and he flies out of the chopper as Iron Man. He speeds through dark clouds. Close behind T'Challa is at the controls of a Quinjet.]
[Steve brings his Quinjet into land besides Zemo's caterpillar truck on the remote icy mountain top. The jet's wings fold up beside the fuselage.
On board Bucky pulls out rack of guns labeled 'Romanoff'. He takes a light machine gun.
Bucky and Steve stand together, waiting for the exit ramp to descend.]
Steve Rogers: You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?
Bucky Barnes: Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs?
Steve Rogers: You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead.
Bucky Barnes: What was her name again?
Steve Rogers: Dolores. You called her Doll.
Bucky Barnes: She's gotta be a hundred years old right now.
Steve Rogers: So are we, pal. [He clamps his hand on Bucky's shoulder.]
[Now wearing his helmet Steve walks with Bucky up to the entrance set in rock. The door is still open.]
Steve Rogers: He can't have been here more than a few hours.
Bucky Barnes: Long enough to wake them up.
[Steve leads them into the cast bunker. They travel down into the depths inside a caged elevator. it stops in the bowls of the bunker, doors slide open. Steve nods to Bucky and heaves up the cage door. Bucky readies his heavy duty machine gun and they walk along a corridor, keeping close to a wall. Bucky looks into an alcove full of junk then he and Steve move on up some stairs. At the sound of a loud thud they spin around, aiming down the corridor.]
Steve Rogers: You ready?
Bucky Barnes: Yeah.
[Double doors part, forced open by Iron Man. Steve stares in surprise. Tony walks towards Steve and Bucky and retracts the suit's helmet.]
Tony Stark: You seem a little defensive.
[Bucky keeps his gun up while Steve walks to meet Tony with his shield covering his body.]
Steve Rogers: It's been a long day.
Tony Stark: At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you.
Steve Rogers: Then why are you here?
Tony Stark: Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
Steve Rogers: Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork. [He lowers his shield.] It's good to see you, Tony.
Tony Stark: You too, Cap. [to Bucky] Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . . [Steve signs Bucky to lower his weapon and he does.]
[the three of them cautiously walk along a corridor. T'Challa in his Black Panther Suit is hiding around a corner, watching them.]
[With his helmet and face plate reengaged Iron Man leads Steve and Bucky towards the enormous chamber with the capsules standing in it.]
Tony Stark: I got heat signatures.
Steve Rogers: How many?
Tony Stark: Uh, one.
[As they enter the vast chamber the lights come on. Hazy, yellow mist descends within the capsules. As well as Josef, each one contains an enhanced soldier from the 1991 experiment. Steve and the others look around, bewildered.]
Helmut Zemo: [on speaker] If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep. [All of the enhanced soldiers have been shot in the head. Bucky stares at Josef's corpse.] Did you really think I wanted more of you?
Bucky Barnes: What the hell?
Helmut Zemo: I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here. [Zemo appears in a control room. Steve hurls his shield but it flies back.] Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.
Tony Stark: I'm betting I could beat that.
Helmut Zemo: Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then you'd never know why you came.
Steve Rogers: You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here? [Black Panther watches from the shadows. Steve looks at Zemo through a window.]
Helmut Zemo: I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized . . . there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw.
Steve Rogers: You're Sokovian. Is that what this is about?
Helmut Zemo: Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I'm here because I made a promise.
Steve Rogers: [He studies Zemo.] You lost someone?
Helmut Zemo: [He looks grave, clicks his tongue.] I lost everyone. And so will you. [He plays surveillance footage from December 16th 1991. Steve steps over to the screen.] An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever.
Tony Stark: [He looks at the freeze frame of a secluded road and the date, December 16 1991. His eyes rove, anxiously.] I know that road. What is this?
[The video plays. That car that the Winter Soldier forced off the road crashes into a tree. Tony watches intently as the Winter Soldier rides up and gets off his motorbike. Steve watches Tony's increasing unease. The driver lies on the ground beside the car. It's Tony's father, Howard.
Howard Stark: Help my wife. Please. Help.
[The Winter Soldier walks over and hoists him up by his hair. He stares at Howard's bloody face. Howard stares back pleadingly.]
Howard Stark: Sergeant Barnes?
Maria Stark: Howard!
[Tony glares at Bucky. In the video the Winter Soldier pounds Howard hard in the face with his metal fist.]
Maria Stark: Howard!
[In grief Tony closes his eyes for a moment. On screen his father slumps dead. The Winter Soldier puts him in the driver's seat with his face against the steering wheel. Tony stares in horror. Maria's in the passenger seat with blood streaked down her face. The Winter Soldier walks around and grips her throat. Expressionless he strangles Maria. Tony watches the screen stunned. The Winter Soldier walks up and aims a gun at the surveillance camera.
Steve watches Tony anxiously. Tony lunges towards Bucky, Steve stops him.]
Steve Rogers: Tony. Tony.
Tony Stark: [Consumed with grief and tears glistening in his eyes he turns and looks at Steve.] Did you know?
Steve Rogers: I didn't know it was him.
Tony Stark: Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?
Steve Rogers: Yes.
[Tony steps back, his chin jutting upwards twitchy. Tony reengages the Iron Man helmet. He punches Steve to the floor and deflects gunfire from Bucky, disarming him. he grabs Bucky and flies across the chamber. He slams him onto the floor, then jumps on his arms. Steve's shield hits Iron Man, distracting him. Steve barges him backwards, Iron Man shoulders him to the floor and shackles his ankles. Bucky punches Iron Man who just lifts him and slams him against a machine. Iron Man raises a fist but Bucky twists it. A rocket shoots out of Iron Man's arm, a fireball explodes. Steve slices his shackles as a towering structure of pipework collapses. Tony and Bucky are thrown down a level as twisted metal falls around them, showering sparks.]
Steve Rogers: [to Bucky] Get out of here!
[As Bucky bolts Iron Man fires, but misses. Steve lands in front of him. Bucky hits a control panel and the silo-styled door overhead starts to open.]
Steve Rogers: It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had control of his mind!
Tony Stark: Move!
Steve Rogers: It wasn't him!
[Steve grabs Iron Man's ankle in mid air and smashes it. Iron Man blocks Steve by shooting down rubble, then falteringly flies up the tower.]
FRIDAY: Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised.
Tony Stark: Ah crap.
[Above him Bucky leaps from platform to platform. With stuttering jets Iron Man gives chase, then kicks Bucky and takes aim, but the energy bold rebounds off Steve's shield onto himself. Iron Man drops like a stone and lands on a lower platform.]
Steve Rogers: He's not going to stop. Go.
[As Iron Man soars upwards, Steve leaps and shoots a wire which wraps around Iron Man's neck and drags him back down. He deflects Steve's shield, then tries to target Bucky.]
Tony Stark: Come on, come on.
FRIDAY: Targeting system's knackered, boss.
Tony Stark: I'm eyeballing it. [His helmet retracts and he shuts one eye, taking aim at the opening hatch. He fires and hits the giant hinge which explodes, cutting of Bucky's escape route. He flies up, blocks two swings from an iron pipe from Bucky, then grabs him around the neck from behind.] Do you even remember them?
Bucky Barnes: I remember all of them.
[Bucky pushes them both from the walkway, Steve jumps into them to deflect their fall. Bucky lands on a platform while Tony and Steve land on the concrete floor besides opening in the wall where snow drifts in from outside]
Steve Rogers: This isn't gonna change what happened.
Tony Stark: I don't care. He killed my mom.
[They trade punches and Iron Man ends up pinning Steve down. Bucky picks up Captain America's shield and leaps down to help. As the two super soldiers fist fight with Iron Man the shield changes hands between them until Tony manages to zap Steve who is thrown back into the wall. Bucky struggles to hold Iron Man at bay as he unleashes an energy beam, then he forces Iron Man against the opposite wall and grips the glowing core in the chest of the Iron Man Suit. A blast of energy knocks Bucky down, metal arm completely blown away. Tony zaps him again. Steve rushes him with his shield up and Iron Man fires right at it]
[Zemo is outside, listening to a phone message.]
Zemo's Wife: You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.
T'Challa: [Sneaks up behind him] I almost kill the wrong man.
Helmut Zemo: Hardly an innocent one.
T'Challa: This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart.
Helmut Zemo: [Deletes the voice message] My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, "Don't worry. They are fighting in the city. We're miles from harm." When the dust cleared . . . and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father . . . still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other . . . I'm sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son.
T'Challa: Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them. [He blinks ruefully and retracts the claws in his gloves.] I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.
Helmut Zemo: [Holding a gun Zemo smiles thinly.] Tell that to the dead. [He tries to shoot himself but T'Challa grabs him just as he fires.]
T'Challa: The living are not done with you yet.
[Tony and Steve are still fighting in the silo.]
FRIDAY: You can't beat him hand to hand.
Tony Stark: Analyse his fight pattern.
FRIDAY: Scanning! [Iron Man's HUD flashes red as Steve lands blow after blow.] Countermeasures ready.
Tony Stark: [He grabs Captain America's shield.] Let's kick his ass. [He flings the shield away then zaps Steve backwards, head over heels. Steve rises and Tony blocks his punches then zaps him to his knees, right in front of Bucky who's lying on his back.]
Steve Rogers: He's my friend.
Tony Stark: So was I. [He punches Steve then throws him back towards the gaps in the wall.] Stay down. Final warning.
Steve Rogers: [He struggles to his feet, his face bloody and his gate weary. He raises his fists and stares Iron Man down.] I can do this all day.
[Iron man raises his left palm ready to fire. Bucky grabs his leg and Tony spins, kicking him in the face. Steve grabs Iron Man and lifts him over his head, then throws him down, punches him and bashes his mask off with his shield before striking down hard on the suit's core.Tony looks horrified and glowers fearfully at Steve who pants for breath. Both have blood spattered across their faces. Steve looks back at Tony then shuts his eyes and slumps down. The shield remains upright, stuck upright in the center of the Iron Man Suit. When Steve struggles up again he takes hold of the shield, gripping the edge and pulling it free. He steps away from Tony who rolls painfully onto his side. Bucky lies bloodied but conscious, Steve reaches out and pulls him to his feet, holding him up as Tony looks on.]
Tony Stark: That shield doesn't belong to you. [Steve turns his back.] You don't deserve it. My father made that shield! [Steve stops, raises his chin, then drops the shield and walks away with Bucky's arm around his shoulder.]
[In a secure chamber at the Berlin UN bunker Zemo's contained in a prison pod, his ankles cuffed to his seat. Everett Ross enters the chamber.]
Everett Ross: Meals at eight and five. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line. Hmm? [Zemo just stares.] So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort . . . and, to see it fail so spectacularly?
Helmut Zemo: [He looks up to meet Everett's gaze.] Did it?
[Back at Avengers HQ, Tony is with Rhodes as he tentatively walks beside parallel bars with tech on his legs.]
Tony Stark: It's just the first pass.
James Rhodes: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?
James Rhodes: You may wanna think about some AC down in . . . [He falls onto his hands.]
Tony Stark: Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
James Rhodes: No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me. [He rises to his hands and knees, turns to sit on the floor beside Tony.] 138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think. [He gives a crooked smile and takes Tony's hand.]
Tony Stark: You okay?
James Rhodes: Oh yeah.
FedEx Driver Stan Lee: [Knocks on the window with a packet in his hand.] Are you Tony "Stank"?
James Rhodes: Yes, this is--this is Tony "Stank". You're in the right place. Thank you for that! I'm never dropping that, by the way. Table for one, Mr. "Stank". Please, by the bathroom.
[Tony is alone, opens the package and finds an envelope and a phone inside.]
Steve Rogers: [letter to Stark] Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should . . . [As Steve reads his letter off screen it's indicated that he breaks his team out of the Raft.]
FRIDAY: Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.
Tony Stark: Yeah, put him through.
Secretary Ross: Tony, we have a problem.
Tony Stark: Ah, please hold.
Secretary Ross: No. Don't . . .
Steve Rogers: [letter to Stark] So, no matter what. I promise you, if you need us, if you need me, I'll be there.
[Wakanda, medical facility.]
Steve Rogers: You sure about this?
Bucky Barnes: I can't trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head I think going back under is the best thing . . . for everybody. [He goes back into cryo.]
[Steve stands staring through a window, T'Challa walks towards him.]
Steve Rogers: Thank you for this.
T'Challa: Your friend and my father, they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace…
Steve Rogers: You know, If they find out he's here . . . they'll come for him.
T'Challa: Let them try.
[In Peter's room on Queens. May speaks to him from somewhere in the apartment.]
May Parker: So. Who was it? Who hit you?
Peter Parker: Some guy. So itchy, man. God. [He fiddles with a wrist band.]
May Parker: What's "some guy's" name?
Peter Parker: Uh, Steve.
May Parker: Steve? From 12-C? With the overbite?
Peter Parker: No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn. [Peter's wrist band emits a red beam which he hides when his aunt comes into the room.] Ouch.
May Parker: Well . . . I hope you got a few good licks in.
Peter Parker: Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge. [May gives him ice in a towel.] That's way better. Thank you.
May Parker: Okay, tough guy. [She smiles broadly then leaves the room.]
Peter Parker: Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door? [He shines the red beam onto his bedroom ceiling and grins looking up at a glowing image of Spider-Man's mask.]
[the final screen text shows 'Spider-Man will return']

BLACK:

O.S. “BRANDY” by LOOKING GLASS PLAYS.

EXT. FORD COBRA MUSTANG - DAY

SUPER: MISSOURI

EARTH
1980

OVERHEAD SHOT: A ‘79 Cobra winds alongside the Missouri 
River, past swaying loosestrife, vibrant sugar maples, and 
oily self-pump gas stations.  A hazy sun glints off the hood 
of the Cobra which, like its descendant the Milano, is orange 
and teal. 

We MOVE DOWN AND IN on a fresh-faced girl of 18 in the 
passenger seat: MEREDITH QUILL. As “Brandy” blasts from the 
car stereo, she pushes her fine, feathered hair from her 
mouth, and sings along, out-of-tune -  

MEREDITH

Do do do do do do do do do do do!

The driver, a MYSTERIOUS MAN in his 30’s, dressed in sleek, 
mod attire, LAUGHS.  

Meredith LAUGHS too.  She SINGS and dances with abandon in 
her seat.  She’s a lively goofball, and it’s apparent where 
Peter Quill received much of his personality.

EXT. DAIRY QUEEN/WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

The Cobra pulls beside this Dairy Queen in a desolate area.  

EXT. WOODS BEHIND DAIRY QUEEN - MOMENTS LATER

The Mysterious Man helps Meredith down the steep hillside 
into the woods.  “Brandy” continues to play on the car stereo 
in the lot behind them.  Meredith GIGGLES.

MYSTERIOUS MAN

This way, my river lily.

MEREDITH

Where are you taking me?

The Mysterious Man shows her a STRANGE SPROUT nestled amongst 
the trees.  

A few inches tall and decidedly alien in nature, its delicate 
limbs twist and turn in a complex pattern.

MEREDITH (CONT’D)

Oh. It’s beautiful.

The Mysterious Man looks proudly at Meredith.  With a 
perpetually excited glint in his eye, and the air of a self-
empowerment guru, he is an intoxicating presence.

MYSTERIOUS MAN

I was afraid it wouldn’t take to 
the soil, but it rooted quickly. 

He nods toward the sky between the branches above.

MYSTERIOUS MAN (CONT’D)

Soon it will be everywhere - all 
across the universe, fulfilling 
life’s one true purpose.  

MEREDITH

Which is what?

MYSTERIOUS MAN

Expansion.

The Mysterious Man takes her in his arms.  He gazes into her 
eyes.  She grows almost teary.

MEREDITH

I’m not sure what you’re talking 
about. But I like the way you say 
it.

MYSTERIOUS MAN

My heart is yours, Meredith Quill.

MEREDITH

I can’t believe I fell in love with 
a spaceman.  

And they KISS, with passion, and love.  “DO DO DO DO DO DO DO 
DO DO DO DO!” sings Looking Glass as SOURCE BECOMES SCORE and 
we TILT DOWN to the plant. It TWITCHES AND GROWS AND TWISTS. 

We PUSH IN ON IT, where we see the plant is made, not only of 
cellulose and leaves, but of a BRIGHT COSMIC LIGHT. And we 
KEEPING PUSHING IN, INTO THE PLANT ITSELF, more FLESH-LIKE

“BRANDY” DISTORTS AND TRANSFORMS into something epic.

O.S. A CRACK OF INTERDIMENSIONAL THUNDER

EXT. THE SOVEREIGN - OUTER SPACE

An artificial, golden planet, made of interlocking orbs, 
revolves around a blue sun.  

We PUSH IN on THUNDEROUS INTERDIMENSIONAL CRACKS on one small 
patch of planet.

SUPER: THE SOVEREIGN
       M49 5IOL339P21+H9LNI31

I/E. POWER STATION - DAY

A DIMENSIONAL CRACK SNAPS in the sky overhead.  PETER QUILL 
looks from it to an old MATTEL ELECTRONICS FOOTBALL GAME 
converted into a tracker.  A RED DOT APPROACHES.  

QUILL

Showtime, a-holes! It’ll be here 
any minute!  

GAMORA (O.S.)

Which will be its loss.  

Quill turns toward GAMORA, loading a rifle.  DRAX, ROCKET, 
and BABY GROOT also ready themselves for battle in this 
grand, open-air power station. Dozens of BATTERIES are 
couched in conductor towers encircling them. Quill, Gamora, 
and Rocket wear flying rigs.  

QUILL

Is that a rifle?

GAMORA

You don’t know what a rifle is?

QUILL

I thought your thing was a sword.

GAMORA

We’ve been hired to stop an 
interdimensional beast from feeding 
on those batteries’ energy, and I’m 
going to stop it with a sword?

QUILL

(mumbling to himself)

Don’t look at me like I’m stupid. 
You’re the one being all 
inconsistent.

A LOUDER, LARGER CRACK: something seems to be fighting its 
way through the sky.

GAMORA

Drax, why aren’t you wearing one of 
Rocket’s aero-rigs?

DRAX

It hurts.

GAMORA

Hurts?

DRAX

(muttering)

I have sensitive nipples. 

Rocket, who is working on a pair of speakers wired to Quill’s 
Walkman, LAUGHS HARD at this. Drax points at him.

DRAX (CONT’D)

What about him?! What’s he doing?!

ROCKET

If I finish this, we can listen to 
tunes while we work.

DRAX

How is that a priority?

ROCKET

Blame Quill! He’s the one who loves 
music so much!

QUILL

I agree with Drax. It’s hardly 
important right now.

ROCKET

Oh, sure, okayyyy, Quill.

Rocket WINKS at him.

QUILL

No, I really agree with him.

ROCKET

Sure, I know.  

Rocket WINKS some more.

DRAX

I can clearly see you winking.

ROCKET

Damn. I’m using my left eye?

Rocket hears a small GROWL.  

He looks down and sees Baby Groot - newly unpotted, only nine 
inches tall or so - angrily THROWING ASIDE some foraging 
Orloni.  Then he looks up at Rocket, explaining:

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

They were not looking at you funny.

AN EVEN LARGER CRACK! 

Rocket swirls as a GIGANTIC BEAST - a hundred-foot-long 
Lovecraftian monstrosity - BREAKS THROUGH THE 
INTERDIMENSIONAL RIFT.  THE ABILISK is the color of a pinkie 
mouse with kaleidoscopic and deadly SPLATTER MATTER pulsing 
from its maw. 

ROCKET (CONT’D)

Well. That’s intense.

Rocket, Quill, and Gamora JET-PACK OUT OF THE WAY, while they 
BLAST at the creature.  Drax HOLLERS, CHARGING it with his 
twin blades. Quill TURNS ON his mask.

But we FOCUS on baby Groot, who trots up to the stereo 
speakers and Walkman.

He fiddles with two wires.  They SPARK, the stereo POWERS UP, 
and “MR. BLUE SKY” by ELECTRIC LIGHT ORCHESTRA PLAYS as -

THE CREDITS START

Baby Groot DANCES IN-FOCUS in the foreground as the Guardians 
get PUMMELED by the beast OUT-OF-FOCUS in the background.  

Baby Groot’s dancing is arrhythmic and many of his “dance 
moves” are nonsensical mixtures of trembling, swaying, and 
making weird faces. 

But it is joyous.

As Groot struts, Quill comes ROLLING behind him. As he 
stands, he sees Groot dancing and looks at him, worried.

QUILL

Groot, look - !

A TENTACLE FLIES IN FROM OFF-SCREEN, KNOCKING Quill OUT-OF-
FRAME as Groot dances on, blissfully unaware.

Groot, smiling, dances onward, as DRAX, in the clutches of a 
giant tentacle, is SLAMMED NUMEROUS TIMES BESIDE HIM.  

Groot arrives at GAMORA, who is blasting at the OFF-SCREEN 
BEAST.  

GAMORA

Get out of the way, Groot! You’re 
going to get hurt!

Groot stops dancing.  He WAVES at her.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

Hi.

She AERO-JETS back into the fray.  

As Groot DANCES, Drax FALLS directly behind him. 

Groot FREEZES.

Drax stares at him a moment, suspicious. Groot stays frozen.  

Drax LEAVES, and Groot COMMENCES THE DANCE where he left off.

Groot sees an INSECT FLYING BY. 

Suddenly dancing is forgotten and GETTING THIS BUG is all-
important. He CHASES it. 

He HOPS up and grabs it from the air...

And starts EATING it.  

Rocket spots this and FLIES DOWN beside him, worried.  He 
PRIES OPEN GROOT’S MOUTH with his fingers, frantically trying 
to get it out.

ROCKET

Spit it out! Spit it out!

Groot COUGHS IT OUT. The bug FLIES crookedly away, one wing 
mulched.  

Rocket JETS OFF back toward the battle, muttering:

ROCKET (CONT’D)

Disgusting.

Groot sees something else and becomes furious. We follow his 
line of sight to a GRAZING ORLONI.  

6

© Marvel 


Groot SCREAMS A WAR CRY and ATTACKS IT.  He GROWS HIS 
BRANCHES AROUND IT, and the terrified Orloni DARTS AWAY, 
DRAGGING GROOT WITH IT.  

Groot’s anger becomes panic as he is DRAGGED AROUND BY THE 
ORLONI and can’t let go.  

The Orloni DARTS around the power station and underneath the 
RAGING BATTLE, a CRYING Groot bouncing along behind it.  

Finally, he LETS GO and goes TUMBLING, ROLLING directly INTO 
THE CAMERA.

And then stands up and, as if none of it happened at all, 
starts DANCING AGAIN.

We PAN and see the speakers and Walkman beside him, and we 
realize Baby Groot has traveled around the entire Power 
Station and has arrived back where he started -

When Drax is FLUNG by the beast into the stereo system, 
SMASHING it.

Groot stops dancing. Angry that Drax has ruined his fun, he 
picks up a piece of the stereo and beats him with it.

CREDITS END.

Drax stands and glares at the ferocious beast as Rocket, 
Quill, and Gamora BLAST at it without effect. 

DRAX

The beast’s hide is too thick to be 
pierced from the outside. I must 
cut through it from the inside.

GAMORA

Huh?

Drax HOLLERS, CHARGING the creature.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

Drax, no! That doesn’t make -

The creature OPENS ITS ENORMOUS MOUTH, SCREECHING, and Drax 
LEAPS INSIDE IT, instantly swallowed up.

QUILL

What is he doing?!

GAMORA

He said the skin is too thick to be 
pierced from the outside, so he --

7

© Marvel 


QUILL

That doesn’t make sense!

GAMORA

I tried to tell -- !

QUILL

Its skin is the same thickness from 
the inside as from the out!

GAMORA

I REALIZE THAT.

INT. BEAST’S STOMACH - DOESN’T MATTER

Drax HOLLERS as he SLASHES AWAY inside the goo of the beast’s 
stomach.  To no avail.

I/E. POWER STATION - DAY

Quill reloads his pistol, thinking.

QUILL

Gamora, there’s a cut on its neck - 
Rocket, get it to look up.

Quill and Rocket JET UP HIGH up over the creature as they 
BLAST REPEATEDLY at it.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Hey, you giant Sea Monkey, up here!

Gamora’s rifle is jammed.  She tosses it down.  PULLS HER 
SWORD.  SNAPS IT OPEN.

The beast SCREECHES at Quill and Rocket FLYING overhead.  The 
colorful SPLATTER MATTER FLIES FROM ITS MOUTH, BATTERING 
ROCKET, BURNING his clothes.  

But its neck is exposed, where the skin is thinner, and there 
is a small wound.

Gamora DASHES, LEAPING HIGH into the air, and she PLUNGES her 
sword directly into the wound. 

She holds tight to the hilt as she FALLS, SLICING AN INCISION 
down the length of the creature’s neck.

The beast WOBBLES, TOPPLES, and DIES.  As it COLLAPSES, Drax 
SPILLS OUT of the wound. He raises his arms in victory.

DRAX

Ha ha! I have single-handedly 
vanquished the beast!

Quill SCOFFS. Rocket SNORTS. Gamora stares at him, dead-eyed.  
Baby Groot throws a rock at him.

DRAX (CONT’D)

What?

I/E. POWER STATION - MOMENTS LATER

The Guardians de-rig by the Anulax batteries.  

DRAX

What are they called again?

QUILL

Anulax batteries.  

DRAX

Harbulary batteries.

QUILL

That’s nothing like what I just 
said. But they’re worth thousands 
of units a piece. Which is why the 
Sovereign hired us to protect them.  

Rocket pulls out one of the ANULAX BATTERIES, checking it 
out.

Gamora, Drax, and Quill walk on.  Rocket stays back a moment. 
Quill nods down the walkway, where GOLDEN SOVEREIGN CITIZENS 
stand at the edge of the station, gawking.  

QUILL (CONT’D)

Just be careful what you say around 
these folks. They’re easily 
offended and the cost of 
transgression is death.

DRAX

Sounds judgmental for a bunch of 
golden morons.

QUILL

That’s the kind of thing you might 
want to keep to yourself.

GAMORA

I’ll hold my tongue, as long as 
they deliver what was promised.

EXT. LAIR OF THE HIGH PRIESTESS - MORNING

An enormous golden palace in the shape of a globe, dappled by 
morning sunlight.

AYESHA (O.S.)

We thank you, Guardians, for 
putting your life on the line. We 
could not risk the lives of our own 
Sovereign citizens. 

INT. LAIR OF THE HIGH PRIESTESS - DAY

HIGH PRIESTESS AYESHA is stunningly beautiful with golden 
skin.  Her CHAMBERMAIDS and other DENIZENS flutter throughout 
her luxurious lair, all of whom are equally perfect.  

AYESHA

Every citizen is born exactly as 
designed by the community, 
impeccable, both physically and 
mentally. We control the DNA of our 
progeny, germinating them in 
birthing pods. 

QUILL

I guess I prefer making people the 
old-fashioned way.

AYESHA

Well... perhaps someday you could 
give me a history lesson in the 
archaic ways of our ancestors... 
for academic purposes.

QUILL

Yeah, I mean, if it’s for research 
that could be pretty --

Quill sees Gamora staring at him.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Pretty repulsive. I’m not into that 
kind of casual -

GAMORA

Oh, please. 

(to Ayesha)

Your people promised something in 
trade for our services.  Bring it 
and we shall gladly be on our way.

Ayesha nods.  

Two SOLDIERS emerge with A WOMAN in a hood and cloak, her 
wrists bound by SHACKLES.  They SHOVE HER TO HER KNEES and 
yank back her hood, REVEALING --

NEBULA. Her clothes are tattered.  Her hand is now just a low-
tech metal claw.  

She glares at Gamora.  Gamora glares at her. Quill looks from 
one to the other, feeling the tension.

QUILL

(quietly)

Family reunion. Yaaaay.

AYESHA

I understand she is your sister?

Gamora roughly picks Nebula up, starts to go.  

GAMORA

She’s worth no more to me than the 
bounty due for her on Xandar.

AYESHA

Our soldiers apprehended her 
attempting to steal the batteries. 
Do with her as you please. 

QUILL

Thank you, High Priestess Ayesha.

Quill starts to go.

AYESHA

What is your heritage, Mr. Quill?

Quill turns back towards her, uncomfortable with the 
question.

QUILL

My mother is from earth.

AYESHA

And your father?

QUILL

He’s... not from Missouri, that’s 
all I know.

Ayesha stares at him as if she’s eaten something foul.

AYESHA

I see it within you, an unorthodox 
genealogy. A hybrid that seems 
particularly... reckless. 

Quill tries not to let this affect him, but it does. Rocket 
grins a huge, fake grin at Ayesha.

11

ROCKET

You know, they told me you people 
were conceited douchebags. But that 
isn’t true at all.

Rocket turns to Quill and WINKS.  The Guardians shift 
uncomfortably.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

Oh, shit, I’m using my wrong eye 
again, aren’t I?

(to Ayesha)

I’m sorry. That was meant to be 
behind your back.

Drax YANKS Rocket away.  

Gamora and Quill head out of the lair. Drax and Rocket are a 
few paces behind.

DRAX

Count yourself blessed they didn’t 
kill you.

ROCKET

You’re telling me. You wanna buy 
some batteries?

Rocket grins and shows Drax something hidden in his bag - TWO 
ANULAX BATTERIES.

“LAKE SHORE DRIVE” by ALIOTTA, HAYNES, AND JEREMIAH PLAYS. 

Drax LAUGHS. Rocket SHUSHES him so Quill and Gamora don’t 
hear.

EXT. SOVEREIGN SPACE DOCK/THE MILANO - MOMENTS LATER

The Milano RISES into the blue sunset over the Sovereign 
Space Dock filled with golden, capsule-shaped ships. 

Rocket works the controls as they rise up. He speaks into the 
comm:

ROCKET

Let’s get baldy back to Xandar and 
retrieve that bounty!

INT. MILANO LOWER FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Groot lies on the rear window peering out the back as they 
pass overhead.

On the CASSETTE PLAYER AWESOME MIX VOL. 2 is playing; we PAN 
away from it, MOVING IN on Quill, looking perturbed as he 
takes off his jacket. 

Gamora is nearby, putting shackles on Nebula.

GAMORA

You all right?

QUILL

That stuff about my father. Who 
does she think she is?

GAMORA

I know you’re sensitive about that.

QUILL

I’m not sensitive about it. I just 
don’t know who he is. 

Gamora nods.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Sorry if it looked like I was 
flirting with her. I wasn’t.

GAMORA

I don’t care if you were.

Gamora pushes Nebula to the rear of the craft. 

QUILL

I think you do care. That’s why I’m 
apologizing. 

Quill watches her go, somewhat longingly. 

DRAX

Gamora is not the one for you, 
Quill.

Quill is startled to see Drax directly beside him.

DRAX (CONT’D)

There are two types of beings in 
the universe. Those who dance, and 
those who do not.  

QUILL

Uh huh.

DRAX

I first met my beloved at a war 
rally.

Everyone in the village flailed 
about, dancing. Except one woman. 
My Ovette. I knew immediately she 
was the one. 

Quill nods, trying to be polite.

DRAX (CONT’D)

The most melodic song in the world 
could be playing, and she wouldn’t 
even tap her foot. She wouldn’t 
move a muscle. One might assume she 
was dead.

QUILL

Well, that is pretty hot, but--

DRAX

It would make my nether regions 
engorge -

QUILL

All right, okay, fascinating, don’t 
need to hear it.  I get your point, 
I’m a dancer and Gamora is not.

Drax smiles kindly, clutches Quill’s shoulder.

DRAX

You just need to find a woman who 
is pathetic, like you.

At the rear of the ship, Gamora roughly restrains Nebula. 
Nebula notices a bowl of fruit.

NEBULA

I am hungry. Hand me some of that 
yaro root. 

GAMORA

No. It’s not ripe yet. And I hate 
you.

NEBULA

You hate me?! You left me there 
while you stole that stone for 
yourself. Yet here you stand, a 
hero, a Garden of the Galaxy!

GAMORA

A what?

Nebula stares at her, confused.

DRAX (CONT'D)

14

GAMORA (CONT’D)

‘Guardians of the Galaxy.’

NEBULA

Oh.

GAMORA

Why would we be ‘the Gardens of the 
Galaxy’? 

NEBULA

I don’t know. I thought it was 
stupid. 

GAMORA

Yeah, it would be. 

NEBULA

It’s still wordy.

GAMORA

I wasn’t the one who thought of it.

NEBULA

Your name doesn’t matter. I’ll be 
free of these shackles soon enough, 
and I’ll kill you, I swear.

GAMORA

No. You’ll live out your days in a 
prison on Xandar, wishing you 
could.

WARNING LIGHTS FLASH.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - MOMENTS LATER

Gamora MOVES UP from the stairs. Rocket and Quill are in the 
pilot seats. Drax is moving up from the back.

QUILL

We got an armed Sovereign fleet, 
approaching from the rear.

Gamora takes the center seat, sees a REARVIEW SCAN: 

Golden, capsule-shaped, Sovereign OMNICRAFT, with a video 
screen on front and a blaster on each side - getting closer.

GAMORA

Why would they do that?!

15

© Marvel 


DRAX

Probably because Rocket stole some 
of their batteries.

Quill and Gamora look at Rocket, astounded.  Rocket gawks at 
Drax, betrayed.

ROCKET

Dude.

DRAX

Oh, right.  He didn’t steal one of 
those. I don’t know why they’re 
after us. What a mystery this is.

THE SOVEREIGN FIRE UPON THE MILANO. 

Quill does his best to evade their blasts.

QUILL

What were you thinking?!

ROCKET

Dude, it was really easy to steal.

GAMORA

That’s your defense?

ROCKET

Come on. You saw how that high-
priestess talked down to us! I’m 
teaching her a lesson!

QUILL

Oh! I didn’t realize your 
motivation was altruism. A shame 
the Sovereign have mistaken your 
intentions and are trying to kill 
us.

ROCKET

Exactly.

QUILL

I WAS BEING SARCASTIC!

ROCKET

Oh no! You tricked me! You’re 
supposed to use a sarcastic voice!  
Now I look foolish!

Drax points at Rocket and LAUGHS at him.

16

QUILL

SHUT UP, DRAX! You knew! You should 
have told us!

Drax is aghast. He looks at Rocket.

DRAX

Did you tell him it was easy to 
steal?

ROCKET

Are you kidding me?

DRAX

What?

ROCKET

You never listen to anything!

GAMORA

None of you listens! Can we please 
just put the bickering on hold 
until after we survive the massive 
space battle?!

Rocket glances at Quill, nodding back at Gamora.

ROCKET

Whoa. Somebody woke up on the wrong 
side of the bed this morning.

QUILL

Do not try to bro down with me 
right now, dude.  I will fricking
punch you in your fricking face.

ROCKET

Real nice! Resorting to violence.

QUILL

More incoming!

MORE SHIP FLY AT THEM from the front.

ROCKET

GOOD! I WANT TO KILL SOME GUYS!

They twist and turn between the oncoming ships as ROCKET 
FIRES AT THEM, SCREAMING.  They EXPLODE. 

On the front of the Sovereign ships is the VIDEO IMAGE OF A 
PILOT.

SOVEREIGN PILOT (ON SHIP)

Bloody hell!

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

The same SOVEREIGN PILOT sits in a REMOTE POD. On a SCREEN in 
front of her we see ROCKET FIRING. 

The SHIP IS HIT and the SCREEN GOES STATIC. 

The Pilot SHOUTS in anger, like a kid who lost at a video 
game. 

High Priestess Ayesha surveys from a walkway above; ROWS OF 
PODS containing PILOTS, all flying their Omnicraft remotely.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK

GAMORA

You’re not killing anyone. Those 
ships are all remotely piloted.

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

A SOVEREIGN ADMIRAL is beside Ayesha.

AYESHA

What is the delay, Admiral?

ADMIRAL

High Priestess, if we destroy their 
craft, we risk destroying the 
batteries. They’re extraordinarily 
combustible and could, in turn, 
destroy the entire fleet.

AYESHA

We have thousands of batteries and 
thousands of ships. Our concern is 
their slight against our people. We 
hired them and they steal from us? 
It is heresy of the highest order. 

The Admiral speaks into his comm.

ADMIRAL

All command modules -

A FRIGHTENED SOVEREIGN PILOT, on the outskirts of the battle, 
hears the Admiral in his headset.

ADMIRAL (O.S.) (CONT’D)

A MEAN SOVEREIGN PILOT, FIRING at the Milano, smirks.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

THE MILANO’S WING IS STRUCK.  The EMERGENCY SYSTEMS FLASH ON. 

QUILL

What’s the closest habitable 
planet?

Gamora dances her fingers over the UNIVERSAL NEURAL 
TELEPORTATION NETWORK, clicking through “jump points” until 
she finds one.

GAMORA

It’s called Berhert.

QUILL

How many jumps?

GAMORA

Only one. But the access point is 
47 clicks away. And it’s through 
that Quantum Asteroid Field over 
there. 

Quill spots, to his side, a HUGE FIELD OF SMALL, GLOWING 
ASTEROIDS, SWIRLING IN RANDOM PATTERNS, DISAPPEARING OUT OF 
SPACE and EMERGING AGAIN a few feet or a few yards away.

Quill ZOOMS SIDEWAYS toward the field.

DRAX

Quill, to make it through that, 
you’d have to be the greatest pilot 
in the universe.

Quill smirks.

QUILL

Lucky for us -

ROCKET

I am.

Rocket FLIPS the pilot controls between them so that he’s the 
one piloting the ship.  Quill gapes at him.

The Milano DIVES into the QUANTUM ASTEROID FIELD, SWOOPING in 
and around the SWIRLING ATOMIZED STONES, barely missing them.  

The Sovereign ships FOLLOW. They are not pilots on par with 
Rocket, so most of the ships are immediately PELTED WITH 
STONES AND DESTROYED.

One after another the SOVEREIGN PILOTS screens go blank, and 
they FALL BACK, angry and upset.

PUSH IN on Ayesha, barely containing her fury.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Quill FLIPS the controls back, so he’s piloting again.

ROCKET

What are you doing?!

QUILL

I’ve been flying this rig since I 
was ten years old.

ROCKET

I was cybernetically engineered to 
pilot a spacecraft!

Rocket FLIPS the controls back to him.

QUILL

You were cybernetically engineered 
to be a douchebag.

Quill FLIPS the controls back to him.

GAMORA

Stop it!

ROCKET

Quill, later on tonight you’re 
gonna lay down in your bed and 
there’s gonna be something squishy 
in your pillowcase and you’re gonna
be, like, ‘what’s this?’ and it’s 
gonna be because I put a turd in 
there.

Rocket FLIPS the switch back.

QUILL

You put your turd in my bed, I 
shave you.

ROCKET

Oh it won’t be my turd, it will be 
Drax’s. 

Drax LAUGHS cheerfully. Gamora glances at him. He explains:

I have famously huge turds.

GAMORA

We’re about to die, and this is 
what we’re discussing?

They raise havoc with the pipes.  
That’s why I do all the plumbing. I 
take responsibility for my actions. 
Unlike some people...

Drax eyes baby Groot. 

QUILL

Groot, he’s right, you have to 
start aiming inside the box.

Groot looks ashamed. Quill FLIPS the controls back.

GAMORA

Stop it.

Rocket SWITCHES it back. Quill SWITCHES it back.

They’re nearing the end of the Asteroid Field when both go to 
switch it at the same time and --

WHAM! A LARGE ASTEROID SMASHES THROUGH the stern of the 
Milano.

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE

A CHUNK OF THE REAR OF THE CRAFT DISAPPEARS.

There’s still a Sovereign craft 
behind us!

The electronics FLICKER.

Our weapons are down!

GAMORA

Twenty clicks to the jump.

The Mean Pilot BLASTS at them from the sole Sovereign Craft, 
TAKING OUT another part of a wing. The Milano is TREMBLING.

Drax starts climbing down into the living area.

QUILL

Where’s he going?

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

A group of pilots have gathered around the Mean Pilot, 
rooting him on, like kids at a video arcade.

FRIGHTENED PILOT

She reaches for a piece, but it’s KICKED OUT OF HER WAY.  

She looks up to see Drax, grabbing a cable on a spool 
attached to the wall.

DRAX

It’s not ripe.

Drax HOOKS the cable to his belt. A folder on the wall reads 
SPACESUITS FOR EMERGENCY and, below that, in Rocket’s scrawl: 
OR FOR FUN.  

Drax pulls a small disk from the folder.  He slaps it between 
his shoulder blades and a SHIMMERY SHEATH COVERS HIS ENTIRE 
BODY - a thin force-field spacesuit.

Gamora watches THE MAP leading to the jump point.

Another BLAST from the Sovereign craft HITS them.

He punches buttons on the wall. A SECOND PROTECTIVE SHIELD 
OPENS UP between him and Nebula, and THE FIRST PROTECTIVE 
SHEATH OPENS, exposing him to space --

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

The Mean Pilot watches in awe as Drax JUMPS OUT the back of 
the Milano.

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE

Drax smiles. The cable UNSPOOLS and SNAPS TAUT when it 
reaches its end.  

Drax is DRAGGED HAPHAZARDLY by the Milano like a water sled 
on a boat.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

ON THE MAP, the jump point gets closer.

GAMORA

Ten clicks.

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA - OUTER SPACE

The Mean Pilot BLASTS WILDLY at Drax, missing him by mere 
inches.  

Drax brings the sight to his eye.  Aims at the ship.  

DRAX

Die, spaceship.

And he SHOOTS, BLASTING the Sovereign ship.

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

The Mean Pilot SCREAMS as his lights go out. The Frightened 
Pilot shakes his head in disgust.

FRIGHTENED PILOT

You suck, Zylak.

Zylak is really sad.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

As Quill and Rocket leave the asteroid field, it seems for a 
moment they’re scot-free... 

GAMORA

Five clicks!

Then DOZENS OF OMNICRAFT pull around them on both sides.

QUILL

Son-of-a-! They went around the 
field!

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

Ayesha smiles.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

It looks like the end of the road for the Guardians when -

THERE IS A BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT AND ALL OF THE OMNICRAFT
EXPLODE.

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

Ayesha watches in shock as the screens in the pods go dead.

ADMIRAL

Someone destroyed all the ships.

AYESHA

What?! WHO?!

But the Admiral doesn’t know.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Rocket sees the BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT is emanating from an OVAL-
SHAPED SPACECRAFT. 

ROCKET

What is that?!

Quill sees the FLICKERING framework of a JUMP POINT.

QUILL

Doesn’t matter! That’s the jump 
point! GO! GO! 

As they’re about to reach the jump point, Rocket sees a MAN 
standing casually atop the oval ship, LIGHT BURSTING THROUGH 
HIS BODY and into the craft - the source of the explosion.

ROCKET

It’s a guy.

Quill doesn’t see as the Milano DISAPPEARS INTO THE JUMP 
POINT.

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA/DIRECTLY ABOVE BERHERT - DAY

The ship POPS IN HERE, TELEPORTING directly above the earth-
like planet. Because the ship is in such bad shape, parts of 
it TEAR OFF AND SPIRAL AWAY as it enters this new atmosphere.

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Gamora sees Drax being dragged in the REARVIEW MONITOR.

GAMORA

Oh my God.

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA/DIRECTLY ABOVE BERHERT - DAY

Drax WHIPS WILDLY OUT of the back of the ship.  The CABLE 
SPOOL on the wall is coming off - 

I/E. MILANO FLIGHT DECK/BERHERT FOREST - DAY

Quill sees a green forest APPROACHING UNBELIEVABLY FAST.

He turns toward Gamora, but she’s gone.  Instead Baby Groot 
is sitting alone, happily munching on candies as if he’s 
watching a movie.

QUILL

Groot, put on your seat belt!

I/E. MILANO LIVING AREA/DIRECTLY ABOVE BERHERT - DAY

The SPOOL DETACHES and FLIES toward the back, which would 
leave Drax in the upper reaches of the planet’s atmosphere -

But Gamora has made it downstairs - she GRABS ONTO THE SPOOL 
with one hand while CLUTCHING onto a secure part of the ship 
with her other.  As it SNAPS TIGHT, it nearly wrenches her 
apart. She GROANS.

QUILL

Prepare for a really bad - 

The Milano HITS THE TREES, BARRELING OVER THEM.  They PART
and FLATTEN and SWAT at the windshield. 

Out back, Gamora HOLDS TIGHT despite searing pain, as Drax 
BOUNCES VIOLENTLY off the trees.

DRAX

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

And, eventually, the Milano comes to an ABRUPT STOP.

SUPER: BERHERT
       M20 22A4834126+306CA12

Drax pushes himself up in the dirt.  He CHUCKLES.  He glances 
back at Gamora like the madman he is.

DRAX (CONT’D)

That was awesome.

Gamora nods, sure, yeah, okay, whatever, dude.

I/E. CRASHED MILANO - CLEARING - MOMENTS LATER

CRANE DOWN OVER THE SMOKING, BATTERED MILANO TO our heroes, 
and a still-shackled Nebula.  

GAMORA

Either one of you could have gotten 
us through that field, if you had 
flown with what’s between your ears 
instead of what’s between your 
legs!

26

QUILL

If what’s between my legs had a 
hand on it, I guarantee I could 
have landed this ship. 

GAMORA

It’s not funny, Peter. We almost 
died. Because of your arrogance.

QUILL

(re: Rocket)

More like because he stoled Anulax
batteries! 

DRAX

They’re called Harbulary batteries.

QUILL

No, they’re not! 

ROCKET

You know why I did it, Star-Munch?

Quill fumes.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

Do you?

QUILL

I’m not going to answer to ‘Star-
Munch.’

ROCKET

I DID IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO.

QUILL

Dick.

ROCKET

What are we even talking about this 
for? We just had a little man save 
us by blowing up fifty ships!

DRAX

How little?

Rocket shows him with his finger and thumb.

ROCKET

Like this.

GAMORA

A little one-inch man saved us?

27

© Marvel 


ROCKET

Well, if he got closer I’m sure 
he’d be much larger.

QUILL

That’s how eyes work, you stupid 
raccoon. 

ROCKET

Don’t call me a raccoon!

QUILL

Oh, I’m sorry, I meant to say 
‘trash panda.’

Rocket pauses, unsure, looks at Drax.

ROCKET

Is that better?

DRAX

I don’t know.

QUILL

It’s worse.

ROCKET

YOU SON-OF-A-!!

Rocket LEAPS, SNAPPING at Quill, when Nebula looks up into 
the sky.

NEBULA

Someone followed you through the 
jump point.

A HUGE SPACESHIP HOVERS overhead. 

The Guardians COCK THEIR WEAPONS as they FALL BACK-TO-BACK in 
tight formation.

NEBULA (CONT’D)

Set me free.  You’ll need my help.

GAMORA

I’m not a fool, Nebula.

NEBULA

You’re a fool if you deprive 
yourself a hand in combat.

GAMORA

You’ll attack me the moment I let 
you go.

28

NEBULA

(mumbly, unconvincing)

No, I won’t.

QUILL

You’d think an evil supervillain
would learn how to properly lie.

DRAX

I bet it’s the one-inch man!!

The SHIP LANDS, CRUSHING ALL OF THE TREES AROUND IT.  

A HATCH OPENS, and an adventurous, outer space frontiersman 
steps forward. He has grown hardened and haggard over the 
years, but he is definitely the MYSTERIOUS MAN from the 
beginning of the film.  MANTIS, a creepy woman with antennae, 
emerges behind him.  

The Man smiles.

MYSTERIOUS MAN

After all these years, I’ve found 
you.

QUILL

Who the hell are you?

MYSTERIOUS MAN

I figured my rugged good looks 
would make that obvious. My name’s 
Ego. And I’m your Dad, Peter.

EXT. THE IRON LOTUS - DAY

SNOW FALLS GENTLY over this sleepy, pastel-colored town of 
wood and stone buildings.  

PUSH IN on the Iron Lotus, a robot brothel and saloon.  
ASSORTED RAVAGERS, including KRAGLIN, as well as some ROBOTIC 
COURTESANS, are drunk and GIGGLING, trying to catch 
snowflakes on their tongues. 

29

INT. IRON LOTUS SUITE - DAY

YONDU UDONTA is staring out the window as he puts on his 
pants.  He looks utterly disconnected and alone.  

Behind him are three ROBOT COURTESANS.  One pushes a button 
on her neck and she POWERS DOWN.

TULLK (O.S.)

Yondu! Come on down!

Yondu looks down at the street where an older Ravager, TULLK, 
drunkenly dances, waving for him to join.

INT. IRON LOTUS - MOMENTS LATER

Yondu exits his suite. Two bodyguards, BRAHL and HALF-NUT, 
salute and follow him as he descends the stairwell.  

At the bottom of the stairs a group of RAVAGERS in BLUE 
UNIFORMS LAUGH. A gruff, older warrior, STAKAR, and a man 
seemingly made of diamonds, MARTINEX are among them.

Yondu stops when he sees them. He’s struck. Stakar LAUGHS as 
he tells a story -

STAKAR

And I was like, Aleta, I love you, 
but you’re crazy now, you always 
been -  

Yondu approaches Stakar with trepidation.

YONDU

Stakar. 

Stakar is surprised to see him.

YONDU (CONT’D)

Been some time. I’d -

STAKAR

Seems like this establishment is 
the wrong kind of disreputable. 

The blue-coats turn and walk away. 

YONDU

Stakar...

Stakar glances at the PROPRIETOR as he passes her.

30

STAKAR

There are a hundred Ravager 
factions, Sneeper. You just lost 
the business of ninety-nine by 
serving one.

PROPRIETOR

Please, sir! Sir!

Yondu stands there for a moment, hurt, as they head out the 
door. 

But, little by little, his hurt turns to rage and he FOLLOWS.

EXT. IRON LOTUS - DAY

Yondu trots quickly toward Stakar and the others. 

YONDU

You all can go to hell! I don’t 
care what you think of me!

Stakar swirls toward him, furious.

STAKAR

Then why you following us for?!

YONDU

‘Cause you’ll listen to what I got 
to say! 

STAKAR

I don’t got to listen to nothing! 
You betrayed the code! Ravagers 
don’t deal in kids!

YONDU

I didn’t know what was going on - 

STAKAR

You didn’t know ‘cause you didn’t 
want to know, ‘cause it made you 
rich! 

YONDU

I demand a seat at the table! I 
wear the flames same as you!

STAKAR

You may dress like a Ravager but 
you won’t hear no Horns of Freedom 
when you die, boy, and the Colors 
of Ogord will not flash over your 
grave!

You think I take some pleasure in 
exiling you, you’re wrong. You 
broke all our hearts.

Stakar and the others storm away.  Martinex stays a moment, 
staring at Yondu, and then moves on too.

Yondu is left alone, shaken as the WHITE SNOW FALLS GENTLY on 
his blue face. 

NEARBY, a MONSTROUS RAVAGER leans in toward Kraglin, Tullk, 
GEF THE RAVAGER, OBLO, and RETCH. As he eyes Yondu, he 
WHISPERS:

MONSTROUS RAVAGER

First Quill betrays us and Yondu 
just lets him go, scot-free. Now 
he’s getting all riled over 
nothing. We followed him ‘cause he 
was the one wasn’t afraid to do 
what needed to be done. Seems like 
he’s going soft.

KRAGLIN

If he’s so soft why you whispering 
for?

MONSTROUS RAVAGER

You know I’m right, Kraglin.

TULLK

You best watch what you say about 
the Cap’n, Tay -

RETCH

Who the hell is that?!

Tullk stops when he sees High Priestess Ayesha approaching 
beside them. The Chambermaids ROLL OUT a LONG BLUE CLOTH so 
she doesn’t touch unconsecrated ground. 

She STOPS at the carpet’s end. Does her best to force a 
smile.

AYESHA

Yondu Udonta, I have a proposition 
for you.

Yondu looks at her.

EGO (PRE-LAP)

When your mother passed away, I 
hired Yondu to pick you up. 

STAKAR (CONT'D)

EXT. CAMPFIRE/CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT

Quill sits around a campfire with Ego, Mantis and the others, 
eating. Ego indulges heartily.

EGO (CONT’D)

I would have done so myself, but I 
was in the midst of an outlandish 
adventure at the time, battling 
demonic forces to save this 
dimension or some such nonsense - I 
can’t quite recall, it all bleeds 
together after awhile. But instead 
of returning you, Yondu kept you. I 
have no clue as to why.

QUILL

Because I was a skinny kid who 
could squeeze into places adults 
couldn’t, making thieving easier. 

EGO

I’ve been trying to track you down 
ever since. 

DRAX

I thought Yondu was your father.

QUILL

What?

Drax stares at him.

QUILL (CONT’D)

We’ve been together all this time 
and you thought Yondu was my 
actual, blood relative?

DRAX

You look exactly alike.

ROCKET

One’s blue.

QUILL

He wasn’t my father. Yondu was the 
guy who abducted me.  He’d beat the 
crap out of me so I’d learn how to 
fight and he kept me in terror 
threatening to eat me.  

EGO

Eat you?!

33

© Marvel 


QUILL

Yes.

EGO

That son-of-a-bitch. 

GAMORA

How’d you locate us now?

EGO

Even where I reside, out past the 
edge of what’s known, we’ve heard 
tell of the man they call Star-
Lord. 

He stands, handing his dish to Gamora.

EGO (CONT’D)

Say we head out that way now? Your 
associates are welcome, even that 
triangle-faced monkey there. 

Rocket, self-conscious, feels his nose.

EGO (CONT’D)

I promise you, it’s like no place 
you’ve ever seen. And there I can 
explain your very special heritage, 
and finally be the father I’ve 
always wanted to be.

(almost teary)

‘Scuse me. I gotta take a whizz.

Ego leaves.  Quill looks at Gamora. 

QUILL

Not buying it.

GAMORA

Peter, we need to take a walk.

EXT. CAMPFIRE/CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT

Ego is WHISTLING “BRANDY” and PEEING into the bushes. 

Mantis looks at Drax. She GRINS, or at least her best attempt 
at grinning. It’s kind of creepy.

MANTIS

I am Mantis.

DRAX

What are you doing?

34

© Marvel 


MANTIS

Smiling. I hear it is the thing to 
do to make people like you.

DRAX

Not if you do it like that.

MANTIS

Oh. I was raised alone on Ego’s 
planet. I do not understand the 
intricacies of social interaction. 

She points at Rocket.

MANTIS (CONT’D)

Can I pet your puppy? It is 
adorable.

DRAX

(mischievous)

Yes...

She goes to pet Rocket: startled, he SWIRLS and SNAPS at her.

MANTIS

AHH!

She pulls back her hand. Drax LAUGHS, heartily.

DRAX

That’s called a practical joke!

She GIGGLES.

MANTIS

I liked it very much!

They both LAUGH together. Nebula shakes her head with 
disbelief. 

EXT. BESIDE CRASHED MILANO - MOMENTS LATER

Quill and Gamora enter this private spot; the campfire 
flickers through the trees beyond them.

QUILL

Give me a break! After all this 
time, and he just expects to be my 
Dad all of the sudden!

GAMORA

I hear you.

35

© Marvel 


QUILL

I mean, this could be a trap - the 
Kree purists, the Ravagers, now the 
Sovereign - they all want us dead.

GAMORA

I know, but -

QUILL

But what?

GAMORA

What was that story you told me 
about Zardu Hasselfrau?

QUILL

Who?

GAMORA

The wonderful television-singer 
man. He had a magic boat.

QUILL

David Hasselhoff?

GAMORA

Right.

QUILL

He had a talking car, not a magic -

GAMORA

Why did it talk again?

QUILL

Just to be a good friend, I guess.

GAMORA

And as a child you carried his 
picture in your pocket, and you 
told the other children he was your 
father, but he was out of town --

QUILL

(embarrassed)

Shooting Knight Rider or touring 
with his band in Germany. Why are 
you bringing this up now? I was 
drunk when I told you that.

GAMORA

I love that story.

36

© Marvel 


QUILL

I don’t. It’s just sad! I was so 
sad because I’d see the other kids 
off playing catch with their dads, 
and I wanted that, more than 
anything in the world. 

Gamora takes Quill’s hands in her own.

GAMORA

My point is, maybe this man is your 
Hasselhoff. I know it’s a long 
shot. But I lost my father as a 
child. I’d give anything...

Quill nods, grudgingly. 

GAMORA (CONT’D)

If he ends up being evil, we’ll 
just kill him.

Quill CHUCKLES.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

What’s funny?

I/E. CRASHED MILANO - SUNRISE

Inside the ship, “THE CHAIN” BY FLEETWOOD MAC PLAYS on the 
cassette player. Nebula is angry.

NEBULA

You’re leaving me with that fox?!

Rocket is SOLDERING the ship.  

GAMORA

He’s not a fox.

Gamora glances at Rocket as she grabs her outer-space-
adventurer version of luggage.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

Shoot her if she does anything 
suspicious. Or if you feel like it.

Rocket GRUNTS.  Gamora looks at a sad Baby Groot.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

It will just be a couple days.  
We’ll be back before Rocket’s 
finished fixing the ship.

37

Gamora steps out. Rocket sees Groot, who is ABOUT TO CRY as 
he watches them go.

Drax and Quill come from the back of the ship.

DRAX

What about your spool of songs?

QUILL

I have clones.

DRAX

What if the Sovereign come?

QUILL

There’s no way for them to know 
they’re here.

DRAX

I am uncertain about parting ways.

QUILL

You’re like an old woman.

DRAX

Because I am wise?

Quill turns to Rocket as Drax and Gamora head toward the 
ship. He starts to say something nice - perhaps something 
conciliatory but --

ROCKET

Hope daddy isn’t as big of a dick
as you, orphan boy. 

Quill just shakes his head and SNICKERS.

QUILL

So what’s your goal here? To get 
everyone to hate you? ‘Cause it’s 
working.

Quill turns back around with Gamora and Drax and walks away.

Rocket looks at the others leaving as THE SONG BECOMES SCORE: 
I can still hear you saying you will never break the chain.
Rocket watches them move away.  

IN SLOW-MOTION, Quill, Drax, and Gamora approach the oval 
ship.  The slit opens.  Ego, with Mantis, is waiting inside.

Ego smiles and CLASPS his hand on Quill as he enters.

INT. EGOS SHIP. SUNRISE

Quill sits back against the wall, alone, nervous.  He looks 
across the way at a SLEEP CHAMBER, where Mantis helps Ego lie 
down on a slab.

She places her hand on his forehead with her hand: her 
antennae ALIGHT. And he drifts off to sleep.

Quill takes a small, folded piece of paper out of his pocket. 

It’s the PHOTO OF DAVID HASSELHOFF. 

He looks at it, then looks at Ego.  Quill’s eyes fill with 
cautious hope.  And the SONG ENDS.

EXT. BERHERT - MOMENTS LATER

Ego’s ship rises, blocking out the sun.

EXT. EGO’S SHIP - OUTER SPACE

The Orb moves through a rainbowish funnel of space and time; 
technology beyond what even the Guardians know.

INT. EGO’S SHIP - OUTER SPACE

Quill and Drax are drinking tea and LAUGHING with Mantis.

QUILL

Can I ask you a personal question?

MANTIS

Oh, no one has ever asked me a 
personal question! 

QUILL

The antennae, what are they for?

MANTIS

Their purpose?

Gamora ENTERS, pouring herself some tea.

DRAX

Yes, Quill and I have a bet.

QUILL

You’re not supposed to say that.

39

© Marvel 


DRAX

I say that if you are about to go 
through a doorway that is too low, 
your antennae will feel this, and 
stop you from being decapitated.

QUILL

Just making clear - if it’s 
anything else - any other answer - 
I win?

Gamora smiles, warmed by the good-natured, by-now-familiar 
bickering between Quill and Drax.

MANTIS

They are not for feeling doorways.

DRAX

(bummed)

Damn. I just lost my entire life’s 
savings.

QUILL

Three pairs of pants.

MANTIS

I think they have something to do 
with my empathic abilities.

GAMORA

What are - ?

MANTIS

If I touch someone I can feel their 
feelings -

QUILL

You read minds?

MANTIS

No. Telepaths know thoughts. 
Empaths feel feelings. Emotions. 

She looks at Quill.  

MANTIS (CONT’D)

May I?

Quill doesn’t stop her. Mantis, cautiously, touches him.  Her 
hand quivers as his emotions shoot through her and her 
antennae ALIGHT. She is moved.

MANTIS (CONT’D)

You feel love.

40

© Marvel 


QUILL

Yeah, I guess, yeah, I have sort of 
a general, unselfish love for 
everyone.

MANTIS

No, romantic, sexual love.

QUILL

No. No, I don’t.

Mantis nods at Gamora.

MANTIS

For her.

QUILL

No.

Gamora is embarrassed. Drax starts LAUGHING UPROARIOUSLY.

DRAX

She just told everyone your 
deepest, darkest secret, Quill! 
HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!

QUILL

What the hell, dude? That’s a total 
overreaction. 

Drax SLAPS HIS CHEST.

DRAX

DO ME! DO ME!

Mantis touches Drax. She grins brightly.

MANTIS

I have never felt such humor!

She starts GIGGLING and before long both she and Drax are 
LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY.

QUILL

You got to be kidding me.

Drax and Mantis both point at Quill, clutching onto each 
other and FALLING OVER WITH LAUGHTER. Quill’s humiliated.

QUILL (CONT’D)

That’s so incredibly uncool.

Mantis wipes the tears from her eyes, composing herself.  She 
goes to touch Gamora, who grabs her wrist though her clothes.

41

© Marvel 


GAMORA

Touch me. And the only thing you’re 
going to feel is a broken jaw.

Mantis smiles, nods, backs away.

MANTIS

I can also alter emotions, to some 
extent.  

QUILL

Like what?

MANTIS

If I touch someone who is sad I can 
ease them into contentment, for a 
short while. I can make a stubborn 
person compliant. But I mostly use 
it to help my Master sleep. He lies 
awake at night, thinking about his 
progeny.

Quill looks at her, struck by this.

DRAX

Do one of those on me!

Mantis touches him.  He grins expectantly.

MANTIS

Sleep.

Drax COLLAPSES, INSTANTLY ASLEEP. Mantis smiles at the 
others, hoping she has pleased. Quill and Gamora look at 
Drax, SNORING. They’re surprised.

GAMORA

Is that real?

QUILL

It’s kind of like someone put a 
baby’s head on a big, muscular 
body, isn’t it?

FADE TO BLACK.

O.S. ALIEN INSECTS CHIRP

EXT. CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT

Four moons shine over the forest. The campfire CRACKLES
beside the Milano, and “SOUTHERN NIGHTS” BY GLENN CAMPBELL
emerges from the cassette player within.

42

© Marvel 


The Monstrous Ravager and Kraglin lead a group of Ravagers up 
over a ravine.  Dozens of M-Ships quietly lower behind them.  
Kraglin nods toward the sounds of Glenn Campbell in the 
distance.  They raise their weapons.

OVERHEAD SHOT: dozens and dozens of Ravagers come from 
different directions, surrounding the Milano.

One Ravager cluster, lead by Half-Nut, CREEPS close enough to 
the Milano that they see the lights within the vehicle and 
can hear Rocket inside HUMMING along to the song.

Half-Nut licks his lips in anticipation, closing in for the 
kill, when he steps on a small pedal.  It CLICKS.  

A HUNDRED DARTS FLY AT THE GROUP from traps set in trees.  
They STICK INTO THE RAVAGERS’ BODIES, knocking them instantly 
unconscious. As one Ravager FALLS, a GUNSHOT is discharged.

INT. CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT

Nebula is awakened by the SHOT.  She sees a frightened Groot, 
peering through a hole at the bodies falling. 

PULL BACK TO REVEAL, beside him, a futuristic walkie-talkie 
with ROCKET’S HUMS emerging.

EXT. CRASHED MILANO - PERCUSSIVE BOMB TRAP - NIGHT

Rocket is crouched on a limb in shadows above the Milano, 
smiling and HUMMING to “Southern Nights” into his comm. 

He spots A LARGER GROUP OF RAVAGERS APPROACHING THE MILANO
from the other side, led by Retch. 

Rocket LEAPS TOWARD THEM, from one tree limb to another like 
a squirrel.

The GROUP enters a clearing close to the ship. A TALL RAVAGER 
looks up and spots Rocket LEAPING OVER THEIR HEADS.

TALL RAVAGER

There!

The Ravagers BLAST at Rocket, following him. He HOPS from 
tree to tree as BULLETS WHIZZ PAST HIM, leading them right 
where he wants them. 

He stops in a tree at the end of the run.  He holds a device 
with two buttons. He presses one of them.

A PERCUSSIVE BOMB at the feet of the Ravagers BURSTS, sending 
half of them FLYING UP into the air.  

43

© Marvel 


As the confused group on the ground watches, Rocket presses 
the second button and a second BOMB BURSTS.  They FLY UP INTO 
THE AIR as well.

Rocket SNICKERS, as he continues pushes the buttons and the 
two groups of Ravagers FLY UP and DOWN until the bombs are 
depleted of energy.

Retch looks up from the ground, to see the little animal 
hopping away in the tree limbs overhead.

EXT. CRASHED MILANO - STICKY DISK TRAP - NIGHT

An EVEN LARGER GROUP OF RAVAGERS walk beneath the branches, 
MOONLIGHT FLICKERING ON THEIR FACES.  

TILT UP TO REVEAL ROCKET’S SILHOUETTE on a gnarled limb. He’s 
clutching an armful of small discs.  He breathes shallowly, 
waits.  As soon as the last Ravager is passing beneath him, 
he LEAPS onto his back. 

Rocket JUMPS FORWARD FROM ONE MAN TO THE NEXT, SLAPPING A 
STICKY-DISC to each of their heads - SLAP! SLAP! SLAP! SLAP!

And then he LEAPS from the Ravager at the front of the line 
BACK UP INTO THE TREES.  

The men are confused.  They bring their fingers to the sticky 
discs on their bodies.

Rocket smiles in the tree as he flicks a trigger.  The STICKY-
DISCS SEND ELECTRICITY COURSING THROUGH ALL OF THE MEN’S 
BODIES. 

They CONVULSE for a moment, then COLLAPSE.

EXT. CRASHED MILANO - CLEARING - NIGHT

Rocket LEAPS to the ground in a crouch.  He sees Brahl
approaching in front of him, and then another RAVAGER 
approaching from behind.  They train their weapons on him.

BRAHL

Ain’t so tough now without all your 
toys, are you?

Rocket LEAPS up onto Brahl’s face. 

He PUNCHES HIM IN THE THORAX so hard he can’t breathe.  

The other Ravager SHOOTS at him, but Rocket BACKFLIPS over 
the SHOT so Brahl is STRUCK instead.

Rocket LANDS on the back of the shooter’s neck and RAPID-FIRE 
PUNCHES HIM in the head, until the man CRUMPLES to the 
ground, unconscious. 

As Rocket lands, he HEARS WHISTLING and he looks up to see -- 

YONDU’S ARROW FLYING THROUGH THE TREES, DIRECTLY TOWARD HIM.

ROCKET

Crap.

Another high-pitched WHISTLE and the arrow STOPS ABRUPTLY, 
FLOATING with the tip almost grazing Rocket’s forehead. 

Yondu waltzes out of the trees with Tullk, Kraglin, the 
Monstrous Ravager, and many more.  

Rocket reluctantly raises his hands in surrender.  

YONDU

Hey there, rat.

ROCKET

How’s it going, you blue idiot?

YONDU

Eh, not so bad. We got a pretty 
good gig. A golden gal with quite a 
high opinion of herself offered us 
a large sum to deliver you and your 
pals to her, so she can kill y’all.

INT. CRASHED MILANO - NIGHT

Nebula looks out the window to see even more Ravagers 
surrounding Rocket.  She looks at baby Groot.

NEBULA

Your friend. There’s too many of 
them. They’re going to kill him.

Groot looks as if he’s about to cry.

NEBULA (CONT’D)

He needs my help. If you care about 
him, you need to get me out of 
these bonds.

Groot is unsure.

45

© Marvel 


EXT. CRASHED MILANO - CLEARING - NIGHT

The Ravagers have entirely encircled Rocket.  There’s no 
chance of escape.  Though upset, he mostly holds it in.

YONDU

Pretty easy to find you, since we 
put a tracer on your ship back 
during the War over Xandar.

ROCKET

You give me your word you won’t 
hurt Groot, and I’ll tell you where 
the batteries are.

YONDU

Lucky for you my word don’t mean 
squat. Otherwise I’d actually hand 
you over.

MONSTROUS RAVAGER

Otherwise you’d what?!

Yondu scowls at the Monstrous Ravager.

YONDU

We’ll take the batteries. They’re 
worth a a quarter mil on the open 
market -

MONSTROUS RAVAGER

That priestess offered us a 
million! A quarter is only one 
third of that!

YONDU

A quarter ain’t one-th - 

OBLO

A quarter is four times a million! 
We’re in the money!

GEF THE RAVAGER

No, idiot. A quarter is twenty-
five. 

YONDU

No -

GEF THE RAVAGER

We can’t even buy a pair of boots 
with twenty-five units!

46

© Marvel 


YONDU

The point is, we aren’t stupid 
enough to help kill the Guardians 
of the Galaxy. We’d have the whole 
Nova Corps on us.  

KRAGLIN

(realizing)

That ain’t right. I just gotta say 
it this one time, Cap’n.

Everyone looks at Kraglin.

KRAGLIN (CONT’D)

No matter how many times Quill 
betrays you, you protect him, like 
none of the rest of us much matter. 
I’m the one what sticks up for you, 
me and Tullk. 

MONSTROUS RAVAGER

Damn straight, lad. You’re right: 
he’s going soft. S’pose it’s time 
for a change in leadership!

KRAGLIN

Uh -

The Monstrous Ravager points his weapon at Yondu.  

Others follow his lead. 

A handful of others, including Tullk and the Innocent 
Ravager, raise their weapons in their Captain’s defense, so 
that the whole circle are aiming at one another. Kraglin is 
confused.

TULLK

Put you damn guns down! 

Rocket is in the center of the potential crossfire.  

ROCKET

Hold on! There’s got to be some 
sort of peaceful resolution here! 
Or even a violent resolution, where 
I’m standing over there.

Yondu glares at the Monstrous Ravager.  His FIN LIGHTS UP and 
he starts to WHISTLE when -

A GUNSHOT RINGS OUT; THE FIN IS BLOWN OFF THE TOP OF YONDU’S 
HEAD.  The arrow CLATTERS to the ground.

47

© Marvel 


Rocket watches as Yondu, confused, TOTTERS there for a 
moment, and then COLLAPSES -- 

REVEALING NEBULA behind him, clutching a smoking pistol. 
Rocket looks at her, dead-eyed: really?

She SHOOTS HIM WITH A BLAST OF ELECTRICITY, knocking him 
unconscious.  

The Ravagers gape at Nebula.

NEBULA

Well, hello, boys.  

She takes a bite from a piece of yaro root she stole from the 
Milano. As she chews, she becomes disgusted. 

She spits it out.

NEBULA (CONT’D)

It’s not ripe.

EXT. RED PLANET - MOMENTS LATER

Ego’s ship ARRIVES at a bold red planet, twisting in front of 
an enormous yellow sun, so close it seems like the sun is 
about to devour it. “MY SWEET LORD” BY GEORGE HARRISON PLAYS.

SUPER: EGO’S PLANET
       G52 22C848T12F+E16UC22

INT. EGO’S SHIP - SLEEP CHAMBER - OUTER SPACE

Mantis sets her hand on Ego’s forehead, waking him.

EXT. EGO’S PLANET/SPACEPORT - MOMENTS LATER

Ego’s ship lands in a spaceport.  It organically JOINS the 
spot where it lands - strands of material actually linking up 
with the landing pad itself.

From the front of the craft, a FLOATING TRAM emerges, with 
Ego, Mantis, Quill, Gamora, and Drax.  

As the TRAM GLIDES toward its destination, the Guardians are 
overwhelmed by transcendentally splendid surroundings. The 
plant life is colorful and alien.  Tall, twisting obelisks 
seem to have no function other than beauty itself.

EGO

Welcome, friends, to my world.

QUILL

Wow. You have your own planet?

48

© Marvel 


EGO

But a trifle, no larger than your 
earth’s moon.

DRAX

Humility. I like it. I too, am 
extraordinarily humble. 

Even Gamora smiles at the wonder of it all.  

Multicolored mercurial clumps FLOAT BY.  

Drax pokes one, and it BURSTS INTO A DOZEN VIBRANT HUES. 

EXT. TRAM/PALACE - MOMENTS LATER

Ahead of them looms an astounding palace atop a mountain.

QUILL

It’s beautiful.

The tram STOPS. 

They step off it and toward the palace, Ego stops beside a 
large FOUNTAIN.

EGO

Peter, consider this a token of a 
father’s pride. 

Ego motions; the WATERS OF THE FOUNTAIN FALL AWAY, REVEALING 
a GIANT STATUE OF STAR-LORD: Quill stands heroically, with 
foolish-looking Guardians kneeling around him worshipfully.

EGO (CONT’D)

A memorial to the War Over Xandar, 
when you single-handedly saved the 
galaxy.

GAMORA

Single-handedly?

QUILL

Whoa. It’s perfect.

GAMORA

You’ve got to be kidding.

DRAX

Why am I dead? Why did you all kill 
me?!

GAMORA

That’s Ronan. That’s you.

49

© Marvel 


Drax is sitting on Quill’s shoulder, with a raccoon tail.

DRAX

When was I that tiny?

Gamora shakes her head in disbelief. They step past the 
statue and onto the steps approaching the palace.

GAMORA

You own a planet and can destroy 
two dozen spaceships without a 
suit. What are you, exactly?

EGO

I’m what they call a Celestial, 
sweetheart.  

The Guardians STOP behind him, astounded.

QUILL

A Celestial. Like a... god?

EGO

Small ‘g’, son. At least on the 
days I’m feeling humble as Drax.

He LAUGHS and walks up the stairs.  

INT. PALACE - MOMENTS LATER

Ego SAUNTERS with Quill, Gamora, Drax, and Mantis, through 
the enormous open doors, toward huge DIORAMAS lining either 
side of the palace, like cosmic Stations of the Cross. 

EGO

This form you see before you is 
only an extension of who I truly 
am. I don’t know where I came from, 
exactly.

The DIORAMAS around them begin to ANIMATE: In the first, a 
FLICKERING BRAIN COMPOSED OF POLYCHROMATIC LIGHT FLOATS in 
space. 

EGO (CONT’D)

The first thing I remember is 
flickering, adrift in the cosmos - 
utterly and entirely alone.

The flickering brain pulls cosmic dust and rocks into itself, 
ingesting them, GROWING. 

50

© Marvel 


EGO (CONT’D)

I fed on the matter around me like 
plankton. I grew smarter and 
stronger.   

A hard metal shell forms around the brain, with channels 
running through for his energy to flow like rivers.  

EGO (CONT’D)

I formed a sheathe to protect 
myself from the elements.

Ego continues developing outward from the shell, growing the 
planet, then its beautiful landscapes and structures.

EGO (CONT’D)

And continued building from there, 
layer by layer, the very planet you 
walk on now. I built the spires 
reaching up to the sky and the 
tunnels burrowing into its depths.

QUILL

Wow.

EGO

But I was no ant to be fulfilled 
solely by labor. I wanted more. I 
desired... meaning.

In the core shell - the Self Chamber - the flickering brain 
floats, alone, perhaps sad.

EGO (CONT’D)

There must be some life out there 
in the universe besides just me, I 
thought, and I set myself to task 
with finding it. 

The brain grows a SKELETAL FRAMEWORK OF LIGHT up from the 
self chamber and to the surface of the planet.  He pulls 
molecules around this shape to create his “human” self.  

EGO (CONT’D)

I created what I imagined 
biological life might be like, down 
to the most minute detail.

DRAX

Did you make a penis?

QUILL

Dude.

51

© Marvel 


DRAX

If he’s a planet, how did he make a 
baby with your mother? He would 
smush her.

QUILL

I don’t need to hear about how my 
parents, you know -

DRAX

Why? My father would tell me the 
story of impregnating my mother 
every winter solstice. 

QUILL

That’s disgusting.

DRAX

It was beautiful. You earthers have 
hang-ups.

EGO

Yes, Drax, I’ve got a penis. 

QUILL

Oh my God.

EGO

It’s not half bad. I’ve also got 
pain receptors, a digestive system, 
and all the accompanying junk. I 
wanted to experience what it truly 
meant to be human as I set out 
amongst the stars. 

In another DIORAMA, Ego explores various uninhabited and 
barren planets.  

EGO (CONT’D)

I visited thousands of planets over 
thousands of years, one barren husk 
after the next until I found what I 
sought... 

Ego stares down at a CUTE ALIEN CHILD.

EGO (CONT’D)

Life. I was not alone in this 
universe after all.

Ego reminisces: wistful? Sad? It’s hard to tell. 

QUILL

When did you meet my mother?

52

© Marvel 


EGO

Not long after. 

Ego turns toward the last set of DIORAMAS. They show Meredith 
and Ego kissing and Ego with his hand on Meredith’s pregnant 
belly. 

EGO (CONT’D)

It was with Meredith that I 
experienced love for the first 
time. I called her my river lily. 
And from that love, Peter, you. 

In the final DIORAMA we PUSH IN on the belly and see, inside 
the womb, VERY young Peter Quill, a fetus, himself encased in 
light. 

Quill looks up in amazement - this story is the story of 
himself. And Ego gazes at Quill with adoration.  

EGO (CONT’D)

I searched for you for so long. 
When I heard a man from earth held 
an Infinity Stone in his hand 
without dying, I knew you must be 
the son of the woman I loved.

Ego puts his hand on Quill. Quill wants to believe, but he 
can’t quite let it go. 

QUILL

If you loved her why did you leave 
her?

EXT. THE ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE

The Ravagers’ massive ship FLOATS in space.

SUPER: RAVAGER TERRITORY
       HE2 6SM6R16617+6241023

TULLK (O.S.)

You can’t do this!

INT. ECLECTOR CENTRAL AREA - OUTER SPACE

Ravagers LAUGH as they DRAG Tullk across the floor while he 
STRUGGLES to get free.

TULLK

This is mutiny! Mutiny!

They shove Tullk into a cylindrical room as a glass door 
CLOSES on him.  

53

© Marvel 


He continues SCREAMING and SLAMMING ON THE GLASS, but we can 
barely hear him. 

Half-Nut smiles and presses a button. The outside of the 
compartment OPENS so that Tullk is SUCKED INTO SPACE. 

EXT. THE ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE

Tullk FLOATS AWAY, opening his mouth to scream, but he can’t.  
His FACE AND BODY SWELL QUICKLY and he EXPIRES there.  

As we CURL AROUND his lifeless body, we REVEAL the countless 
other CORPSES of Ravagers loyal to Yondu, leading like bread 
crumbs toward nothing at all.

INT. ECLECTOR CENTRAL AREA - OUTER SPACE

Yondu watches this, helplessly.  He’s in a chair, his hands 
tied behind him. He’s a wreck, his headpiece destroyed, wires 
hanging from a gap in his head where the fin used to be.  He 
sees the mutineers grab the innocent Oblo, DRAGGING HIM to 
the same fate as Tullk.

OBLO

Cap’n, help me! Cap’n?!

Yondu drops his head in shame. 

MONSTROUS RAVAGER

You’re the one what kilt those men 
by leading ‘em down the wrong path.

He PUNCHES Yondu.

MONSTROUS RAVAGER (CONT’D)

Because you’re weak.

He PUNCHES him again.

MONSTROUS RAVAGER (CONT’D)

And stupid.

The Monstrous Ravager turns towards the Ravagers, who listen, 
rapt and vengeful. Nebula leans calmly against a wall, 
watching.  Kraglin watches too, seemingly concerned.  

MONSTROUS RAVAGER (CONT’D)

It’s time for the Ravagers to once 
again rise to glory with a new 
Cap’n... TASERFACE.

The Ravagers SHOUT IN APPROVAL. Taserface throws his arms up 
in glory - when he hears SNICKERING.  He stops.  

54

© Marvel 


He and the other Ravagers turn and see Rocket, also in a 
chair with his arms secured behind him, GIGGLING.

ROCKET

I’m sorry.  Your name is... it’s 
‘Taserface’?

TASERFACE

That’s right.

ROCKET

Do you... shoot tasers out of your 
face?

TASERFACE

It’s metaphorical!

ROCKET

For what?

Taserface thinks. Time for a new answer:

TASERFACE

It’s a name what strikes fear in 
anyone what hears it!

ROCKET

(doubtful)

Really?... Okay, sure.

Taserface screams at him, SPIT FLYING EVERYWHERE.

TASERFACE

You shut up! You’re next!

Taserface goes back to Yondu, bringing out his blade.

TASERFACE (CONT’D)

Udonta, I been waiting to do this 
for a long ti -

Again they hear SNICKERING.  Rocket is burying his mouth in 
his chest, TRYING TO STOP FROM CRACKING UP.

TASERFACE (CONT’D)

What?! What?!

ROCKET

I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I just 
keep imagining you waking up one 
morning, looking in the mirror, 
and, in all seriousness, saying 
‘You know what would be a really 
kickass name? Taserface!’

55

© Marvel 


Nebula smirks. The Ravagers are TRYING NOT TO LAUGH. Rocket 
can’t stop LAUGHING.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

What was your second choice?! 
Scrotum Hat?!

The Ravagers all BUST OUT LAUGHING.

TASERFACE

New plan. We’re killing you first.

Taserface SHOVES HIM BACK, ready to plunge the knife in him.  
Rocket’s smile disappears. He stares at Taserface with dead 
eyes.

ROCKET

Well, dying is certainly better 
than having to live an entire life 
as a moronic shitbag who thinks 
‘Taserface’ is a cool name.

Taserface goes to stab him, when -

NEBULA

That’s enough killing for today.

Taserface turns toward her, irritated.

TASERFACE

Thought you were the biggest sadist 
in the galaxy.

NEBULA

That was when Daddy was paying my 
bills. The Priestess wants to kill 
the fox herself. And he -

(re: Yondu)

- has bounties on his head in at 
least twelve Kree provinces. 

Taserface glares at her. It’s obvious he’s considering 
attacking her.

NEBULA (CONT’D)

I assure you, I am not as easy a 
mark as an old man without his 
magic stick or a talking woodland 
beast.

Taserface decides not to risk it.  

56

© Marvel 


NEBULA (CONT’D)

I want ten percent of the take, and 
a couple more things.

INT. ECLECTOR DOCKING BAY HALL - LATER

Nebula is TRYING OUT A BRAND NEW HAND as Kraglin leads her 
through this hall.

KRAGLIN

We got a whole box of hands if that 
one don’t work out.

NEBULA

It’s fine.

KRAGLIN

You think them Kree is gonna
execute the Cap’n?

NEBULA

The Kree consider themselves 
merciful. It will be painless.

Kraglin comes to an open doorway beside a huge DOCKING BAY, 
and an M-SHIP decked out with lots of weapons.

KRAGLIN

Well, there it is, best ship we 
got. The location of Ego’s planet’s 
in the nav. We’ll wire you the ten 
percent when we’s paid. What you 
gonna do with your share?

Nebula stops at the doorway.

NEBULA

As a child my father would have 
Gamora and me battle one another in 
‘training.’ Every time my sister 
prevailed my father would replace a 
piece of me with machinery, 
claiming he wanted me to be her 
equal. But she won, again and again 
and again.  Never once refraining. 
Because of them, I am this.  So 
after I murder my sister, I will 
buy a warship with every 
conceivable instrument of death. 

(MORE)

57

© Marvel 


I will hunt my father like a dog 
and I will tear him apart slowly, 
piece by piece, until he knows some 
semblance of the profound and 
unceasing pain I know every single 
day.

Kraglin stares at her, weirded-out.

KRAGLIN

Yeah... I was talking about, like, 
a pretty necklace. Or a nice hat. 
Something that’ll make the other 
girls go ‘oooooo, that’s nice.’

Nebula gives him a look of pure death. 

KRAGLIN (CONT’D)

Anyway, uh, happy trails.

INT. PALACE COURTYARD - DAY

Quill looks up at a GIANT SCULPTURE of his mother. He is 
upset. Ego is behind him, watching him, sadly.

QUILL

My mother told everyone my father 
was from the stars. 

Quill turns to look at his father, somewhat accusatory.

QUILL (CONT’D)

She had brain cancer - so everyone 
thought she was delusional. 

Ego looks sad, ashamed. 

EGO

Peter - 

QUILL

Listen. I’d love to believe all of 
this, I really would - but you left 
the most wonderful woman ever, to 
die alone! 

Ego has tears in his eyes.

EGO

I didn’t want to leave your mother, 
Peter. But if I don’t return 
regularly to this planet, and the 
light within, this form will wither 
and perish -- 

NEBULA (CONT'D)

58

© Marvel 


QUILL

So why didn’t you come back?! Why’d
you send Yondu, a criminal, of all 
people, to fetch me?!

EGO

I loved your mother, Peter! I 
couldn’t stand to set foot on an 
earth where she wasn’t living! You 
can’t imagine what that’s like!

QUILL

I know exactly what that’s like! I 
had to watch her die!

Ego stops, seeming to hear his son.  He touches him.

EGO

Over the millions and millions of 
years of my existence I have made 
many mistakes, Peter. But you’re 
not one of them.  Please give me 
the chance to be the father she 
would want me to be.

Quill looks at him, vulnerable.

EGO (CONT’D)

There are so many things I need to 
teach you. This planet, and the 
light within... they are a part of 
you.

QUILL

What do you mean?

Ego takes Quill’s hands in his own, gently, putting them in 
the correct position.

EGO

Give me your hands, son.  Here. 
Hold them like that.

Quill holds his hands apart.  Ego steps back, holding his 
hands in the same way.

EGO (CONT’D)

Now close your eyes and 
concentrate. Take your brain to the 
center of the planet.

Quill concentrates. He holds his hand out.  A white light 
emanates from it.

59

© Marvel 


EGO (CONT’D)

Yes! Yes!

QUILL

Whoa.

The light disappears as quickly as it came.

EGO

Yes, yes - it’s okay. Just relax. 
Concentrate. You can do it. Bring 
it back. 

Quill concentrates and the LIGHT, once again, bursts up from 
the palms of his hands.

EGO (CONT’D)

Yes, yes, now - shape it -

Ego shows him, pulling in the molecules around him, so that 
the light itself forms into the shape of a ball.

EGO (CONT’D)

Feel the energy.

Quill tries to pull molecules into the ball. And, little by 
little, they come, and the ball glows brighter. 

EGO (CONT’D)

Yes.

Quill laughs. Ego is JOYOUS. He almost looks as if he’s going 
to break down in tears.

EGO (CONT’D)

You’re home, Peter.

Ego cups his hands.

EGO (CONT’D)

Here.

Quill, smiling, THROWS him the ball. Ego LAUGHS. He inspects 
the cosmic ball of light, and he throws it back to Quill.

Quill LAUGHS, catching it, and throws it back.  Ego moves 
back further.  

And Ego and Quill continue tossing the ball back and forth 
there, LAUGHING, a friendly father and son game of catch in 
the middle of a palace courtyard.

EXT. PALACE - DAY

Drax and Mantis sit here, soaking in the sun and gazing at 
the lush, flowing hills, like something an alien Maxfield
Parrish would paint. 

DRAX

How did you get here?

MANTIS

Ego found me in my larva state, 
orphaned on my homeworld. He raised 
me by hand, and kept me as his own.

DRAX

So you’re a pet?

MANTIS

I suppose.

DRAX

People usually want cute pets. Why 
would Ego want a hideous one?

MANTIS

I am hideous?

DRAX

You’re horrifying to look at, yes.

Mantis seems sad about this.  Drax notice this, feels bad.

DRAX (CONT’D)

But it is a good thing. 

MANTIS

Oh?

DRAX

When you are ugly and someone loves 
you, you know they love you for who 
you are.  Beautiful people never 
know who to trust.

MANTIS

Well, then I am certainly grateful 
to be ugly! 

(thinking)

Poor Gamora. She can never trust 
anyone.

Drax nods and stares out at spattered patches of water.

61

DRAX

Those pools remind me of a time I 
took my daughter to visit the 
Forgotten Lakes on my homeworld. 
She was like you.

MANTIS

Disgusting?

DRAX

Innocent.

Drax stares out at them without expression.  

Slowly, Mantis TOUCHES his shoulder. 

And, as she does, TEARS INSTANTLY FLOW DOWN HER CHEEKS. She 
stares with Drax at the hills.  They feel the sadness 
together: she cries while he’s stoic.

MANTIS

I have never met anyone like you, 
or your friends. You are filled 
with such... love.  It is a thing I 
did not know existed, not like 
this, and I think... I think it may 
be the very finest of all things.  
It both hurts and soothes the 
heart.

She looks at Drax. There is something she wants to say, but 
she is torn. 

MANTIS (CONT’D)

Drax, there is something I must 
tell -

GAMORA (O.S.)

What’s going on?

Drax and Mantis turn to see her behind them. She smiles.

MANTIS

I am learning many things. Like I 
am a pet and ugly.

GAMORA

You’re not ugly. 

(admonishing)

Drax.

Drax, confused, points at Mantis, as if her ugliness proves 
itself.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

Mantis, can you show us where we’ll 
be staying? I’m getting eye-strain 
in this place.

Mantis nods, yes.

EXT. PATH TO SLEEPING QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

Gamora, Drax, and Mantis walk across the sunset.  

GAMORA

Why are there no other beings on 
this planet?

MANTIS

The planet IS Ego. A dog would not 
invite a flea to live on his back. 

GAMORA

And you’re not a flea?

MANTIS

I’m a flea with a purpose. I help 
him sleep.

Gamora curls around Mantis, cutting her off.

GAMORA

What were you about to say to Drax 
before I walked out?

Mantis looks around, worried.

MANTIS

Nothing.

Gamora and Drax share a look: why is she so scared? Mantis 
moves on. 

MANTIS (CONT’D)

Your quarters are this way. 

INT. ECLECTOR CELL - OUTER SPACE

TASERFACE

We’ll deliver you to the Kree in 
the morning. Neither one of you 
gonna last much longer after that.

Rocket crawls toward them as they walk away.

Okay, Taserface. See you later, 
Taserface. Hey, Taserface, tell the 
other guys we said hi, Taserface!

Taserface glances back, perturbed, as he disappears around 
the corner. 

INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE

Taserface, Gef, and Obtuse come around the hall.

GEF THE RAVAGER

What about the little plant? Can I 
smash it with a rock?

TASERFACE

No, Gef! It’s too adorable to kill. 
Bring it to the tailor.

INT. ECLECTOR CELL - OUTER SPACE

Yondu and Rocket settle.  Yondu looks like a beaten man.

ROCKET

No offense, but your employees are 
a bunch of jerks.

YONDU

I was a Kree battle-slave for 
twenty years when Stakar freed me. 
He offered me a place in the 
Ravagers. Said all I needed to do 
was adhere to the code. But I was 
young and greedy and stupid - like 
you stealing those batteries. 

ROCKET

That was mostly Drax.

YONDU

Me and Stakar, and the other 
captains - we weren’t so different 
from you and your friends. The only 
family I ever had. But I broke the 
code. They exiled me. 

64

YONDU (CONT’D)

These ones here are the ones who 
followed - of course they’re jerks. 
Which is what I deserve.

ROCKET

Slow down, drama queen. You might 
deserve this, but I don’t. We gotta 
get out of here.

YONDU

Where’s Quill?

ROCKET

Went off with his old man.

YONDU

Ego?

Yondu looks concerned. Rocket stares at him, picking this up.

ROCKET

Yeah. It’s a day for dumbass names. 

Yondu SNICKERS.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

You smiled and for a second I got a 
warm feeling, but then it was 
ruined by those disgusting-ass 
teeth. Ever heard of floss? 

Yondu’s smile disappears.

YONDU

You’re like a professional asshole 
or - ?

ROCKET

Pretty much a pro. Why didn’t you 
deliver Quill to Ego like you 
promised?

YONDU

He was skinny, could fit into 
places we couldn’t. Good for 
thieving.

Rocket nods, GRUMBLES.

YONDU (CONT’D)

I got an idea on how to get outta
here. But we’re gonna need your 
little friend.

INT. BAR/QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Baby Groot is wearing a tiny Ravager uniform. He reacts to 
clothes like a cat, struggling to take them off but unable.  
Ravagers are gathered around him, drunk and LAUGHING. They 
are CHANTING “MASCOT.”

RETCH

Lil’ feller’s all worked up! Needs 
a drank!

Retch POURS ALCOHOL on him. The Ravagers LAUGH MORE as others 
POUR DRINKS on him as well. Groot SCREAMS at them, furious 
but helpless.

RETCH (CONT’D)

Lookit how cute it is when it’s all 
riled up!

HALF-NUT

It’s Goddang precious!

INT. ECLECTOR CELL - LATER

Groot, in shadows, MOPES down the hallway, looking 
traumatized. His clothes are torn and he’s soaked in alcohol. 

As he passes the cell, he hears -

YONDU (O.S.)

Hey, twig. C’mere. 

Groot sees Yondu and Rocket looking at him in the cell. He 
steps toward them.  

ROCKET

Oh, man. What’d they do to you?

YONDU

Hey, you wanna help us get outta
here? 

Groot NODS.  Rocket looks unsure. Yondu speaks slowly.

YONDU (CONT’D)

There’s something I need you to 
get, and bring back to me.

Groot NODS.

YONDU (CONT’D)

In the Cap’n’s quarters, there’s a 
prototype fin, like the thing I 
wore on my head.

66

Groot NODS.

YONDU (CONT’D)

There’s a drawer next to the bunk. 
It’s inside that.  It’s red.  You 
got it?

Groot NODS EMPHATICALLY and DARTS OFF to get it.  Yondu looks 
at Rocket, pleased.  

Rocket looks more than a bit uncertain.

INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

Baby Groot CREEPS into this dark room.  DRUNKEN RAVAGERS are 
sprawled everywhere.  

He spots a bureau.  A drawer is half open.  

His face lights up.

MOMENTS LATER

Baby Groot stands outside of the cell, beaming, holding A 
PAIR OF SHORTS.

YONDU

That’s my underwears.

ROCKET

Yeah, I was pretty sure he didn’t 
know what you were talking about. 
You have to explain it more 
careful.

YONDU

All right. It’s a prototype fin -

MOMENTS LATER

Groot is back in front of the cell, holding a wriggling 
ORLONI in his hands.

ROCKET

That’s an orloni. It’s a fin, 
Groot.  

YONDU

You explain it this time.

Rocket starts to speak -

67

MOMENTS LATER

Groot looks hopeful, holding out a CYBERNETIC EYE.

YONDU

That’s Vorker’s eye. He takes it 
out when he sleeps.  Go look again.

Groot starts to SLINK OFF -

ROCKET

But leave the eye here.

YONDU

Why?

Rocket CAN HARDLY SPEAK he finds it so funny.

ROCKET

He’s gonna wake up tomorrow and 
he’s not gonna know where his eye 
is!

MOMENTS LATER

Groot is DRAGGING a LARGE PIECE OF FURNITURE to the cell.

ROCKET

That’s a desk. We told you it was 
this big.

Rocket shows him how small it is with his hands. 

Groot makes a face like “Oh!” as if NOW he gets it. It’s all 
coming together.

MOMENTS LATER

Groot is holding a SEVERED TOE.

ROCKET

Tell me you guys have a 
refrigerator somewhere with a bunch 
of severed human toes.

Yondu SUBTLY SHAKES HIS HEAD.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

Okay, then let’s just agree to 
never discuss this.

Yondu RIPS the Ravager patch off his jacket.

68

YONDU

The drawer you want to open. Has 
this symbol on it, okay?

Groot takes it. He looks at Yondu and NODS. 

And then, slowly, HE PLACES IT ON TOP OF HIS HEAD.

YONDU (CONT’D)

What? No.

ROCKET

He thinks you want him to wear it 
as a hat.

YONDU

That’s not what I said.

Groot takes it off his head.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

(translating)

He’s relieved that you don’t want 
him to.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

He hates hats.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

On anyone, not just himself.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

One minute you think someone has a 
weird-shaped head. The next minute, 
it’s just because you realize part 
of that head is a hat. 

(to Groot)

That’s why you don’t like hats?

Groot nods.

69

YONDU

This is an important conversation 
right now? 

ROCKET

No.  Let’s try again.

INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

Taserface is SNORING and SLOBBERING in his bed.  We see the 
Ravager Patch tossed up onto the bed beside him.  Then 
Groot’s vines GROW up the bed, and he pulls himself up beside 
the sleeping giant.

Groot clasps the Ravager patch in his hand and looks 
fearfully around.  

He spots the Ravager symbol on a night stand drawer. 

He stares at the symbol in his hand, then at the drawer, then 
at the symbol, and then at the drawer again, and then one 
more time for good measure -- he wants to be very, very sure 
they’re the same.

He creeps carefully towards the drawer, GROWING his vines out 
to grab the handle and PULL IT slowly open...

He peers inside.

Beside some writing instruments and a tin of candies, there 
lies a RED FIN, taller and more shark-like than Yondu’s 
current model.  Groot smiles hugely, picking up -

THE TIN OF CANDIES! He’s found it!

KRAGLIN (O.S.)

That ain’t it.

Groot SWIRLS to see KRAGLIN, BACKLIT IN THE DOORWAY, LOOMING 
OVER HIM, intimidating as hell.  And CUT TO --

INT. ECLECTOR CELL - MOMENTS LATER

The RED FIN PLOPS DOWN at Yondu’s feet.  

Yondu and Rocket look up to see Kraglin, holding Groot. He 
stares at the ground -

KRAGLIN

I didn’t mean to do a mutiny.

(pause, then, sadly)

They killed all my friends.

70

YONDU

Go get the third quadrant ready for 
release.

Kraglin SALUTES. 

ROCKET

One more thing.

Kraglin stares at him. 

ROCKET (CONT’D)

You got any clones of Quill’s old 
music on the ship?

INT. ECLECTOR BATHROOM - OUTER SPACE

Brahl is shaving, when, suddenly, JAY AND THE AMERICAN’S 
“COME A LITTLE BIT CLOSER” STARTS PLAYING over the intercom.  

He looks up, confused.

INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY/CELL - OUTER SPACE

TWO RAVAGERS outside the cell hear the MUSIC.  They turn, 
unlocking the cell door.

As they enter, THE CAMERA OVERTAKES them, arriving before 
they do at --

Yondu, sitting calmly; Rocket is finishing ATTACHING THE BIG-
ASS FIN TO HIS HEAD. Its electrical systems POP on. 

PUSH IN ON the two surprised Ravagers trying to UNHOLSTER
THEIR PISTOLS in time.  

Too late.

Yondu WHISTLES.

INT. ECLECTOR CLOSET - OUTER SPACE

The ARROW FLIES OFF a shelf of supplies and SHOOTS TOWARD A 
WALL.

INT. ECLECTOR CELL - OUTER SPACE

The ARROW PUNCHES THROUGH THE WALL behind the Ravagers. They 
swirl to see it --

IT SHOOTS THROUGH ONE RAVAGER 

And THEN THE OTHER --

71

© Marvel 


And then to Yondu; he CATCHES it, and STANDS.  

He SAUNTERS past the two Ravagers as they WOBBLE and FALL.  
Rocket and Groot follow.  

On the way out the door, Rocket looks down and sees TWO 
PISTOLS beside the dead Ravagers. 

He smiles.  

INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - OUTER SPACE

Taserface is awoken by JAY AND THE AMERICANS on the PA.  He 
glances over to see the open drawer beside him, sans 
gargantuan fin.  

He SCRAMBLES for the comm, yelling into it --

TASERFACE

He’s got it! 

INT. BAR/QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

The hoard of Ravagers hear Taserface’s voice.

TASERFACE (O.S.)

HE’S GOT IT! YONDU’S GOT THE DAMN 
FIN!

RETCH

GO!

SERIES OF SHOTS - INT. ALL OVER THE SHIP - OUTER SPACE

ALL OF THE RAVAGERS all over the ship, in a panic, LOAD THEIR 
WEAPONS and HEAD TOWARD THE CELL.

INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE

Yondu and Rocket and Groot COME AROUND THIS CORNER IN SLOW-
MOTION, the three biggest badasses in the history of cinema.

A HOARD OF RAVAGERS, led by Brahl, FILE IN at the end of the 
hallway.

But Yondu WHISTLES and the ARROW TWISTS QUICKLY BACK AND 
FORTH, SLICING THROUGH EACH OF THEM.

Yondu SLAMS through a door into -

INT. ECLECTOR DOCKING BAY - OUTER SPACE

Our heroes step onto a catwalk in this, the biggest space in 
the Eclector.  There are catwalks throughout and dozens of 
docked M-ships. The SCURRILOUS RAVAGER sees them from above --

SCURRILOUS RAVAGER

Down there!

IN AN EXTREME WIDE ANGLE, we see the ARROW FLYING UP AND 
DOWN, BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS, CUTTING THROUGH ALL SORTS OF 
RAVAGERS, closer and further from CAMERA.  

We TRAVEL BEHIND YONDU AND ROCKET as BODIES FALL AROUND THEM 
IN SLOW-MOTION LIKE FIREWORKS.  

Groot looks up and sees RETCH looking down at him. 

RETCH FLEES in terror as Groot GROWS branches to pull himself 
up behind him. 

Groot HOWLS FURIOUSLY, TAKING CHASE. 

Retch YOWLS like a child as he frantically runs.

But Groot GROWS HIS BRANCHES around RETCH’s legs, TRIPPING 
HIM. 

BAM! He FALLS, face first to the floor.

And, with a WAR CRY, Baby Groot FLINGS the sadistic Ravager 
off the edge towards the abyss below.

As RETCH FALLS past Yondu and Rocket, Baby Groot DROPS back 
down onto Rocket’s shoulder, and they push their way through 
the doorway -

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

Yondu, Rocket, and Groot move into this area, where they look 
up at DOZENS OF SECURITY MONITORS encircling them showing 
Ravagers filing toward them from every part of the ship.

Yondu WHISTLES as he watches the MONITORS -

ON A MONITOR, the arrow FLIES out the wall. He whistles so 
that it strikes TWO RAVAGERS running towards them.

It ZIPS out of that room and

73

INT. DARK HALL - OUTER SPACE

A HOARD of Ravagers come running down a hall. The ARROW ZIPS 
overhead, smashing out all the lights so that the hall is 
completely dark, except for the DIM RED LIGHT OF THE ARROW.

And we can just make out the RED LIGHT smashing through the 
body of every Ravager there and then on into --

INT. SPACEPORT - OUTER SPACE

A YELLING CROWD OF RAVAGERS come, hungry for war, when the 
arrow SHOOTS THROUGH THE CHAINS holding a giant spaceship in 
place over their heads.  

It FALLS, instantly CRUSHING them all, and then zips on --

INT. BAR - OUTER SPACE

Gef the Ravager is drunkenly drinking a mug of beer, when the 
arrow zips past him and through the mug, SHATTERING it.

As Gef looks at the shattered mug, confused, the arrow comes 
flying back, ripping through Gef himself, FLINGING him off 
the bar stool.

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

Rocket also uses the MONITORS to pinpoint where their 
attackers are.  He methodically SHOOTS THROUGH the walls, 
striking the Ravagers as they get closer.

WIDE OVERHEAD SHOT, the CAMERA REVOLVES as hoards of Ravagers 
GET CLOSE to Yondu and Rocket but the arrow and gunshots ZIP 
THROUGH THE WALLS taking them all down, one by one, like 
Busby Berkely gone mad.

Then Yondu stops, seeing something on one of the MONITORS.

Taserface, clutching a big ass gun, is marching down the hall 
towards them. 

Yondu WHISTLES, loudly and angrily.

INTERCUT - INT. ENGINE ROOM/SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

Taserface sees THE ARROW COMING AROUND A CORNER TOWARDS HIM.

Yondu WHISTLES again.

The ARROW BURSTS INTO FLAMES.

Taserface DODGES it.

74

He turns to watch it go, CACKLING pridefully over his 
agility.

But his smile quickly dissipates.

The arrow PLUNGES into a giant tank - which EXPLODES, 
ENGULFING HIM.

EXT. ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE

A huge portion of the giant spacecraft EXPLODES, leading to a 
domino effect of one part of the ship BURSTING after another.

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

ROCKET is dumbfounded as he sees on the MONITORS the numerous 
EXPLOSIONS throughout the ship.

ROCKET

You maniac. The whole ship is gonna
blow.

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

A DOOR SWINGS OPEN and TASERFACE FALLS ONTO THE FLOOR, 
ENGULFED IN FLAMES, but furious.

He angrily SLAPS off the flames as he reaches for a 
COMMUNICATIONS MODULE.

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

YONDU

Not the whole ship.

Yondu catches the arrow and walks out.

INT. BAR/QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Kraglin ENTERS, pulling latches and flipping switches and 
twisting dials on elementary flight controls. 

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

With pained effort, Taserface PULLS UP A VIDEO SCREEN with a 
SOVEREIGN CHAMBERMAID.

CHAMBERMAID (ON SCREEN)

Who is this? You’re not supposed to 
be on this line. 

TASERFACE

I’m sending you the coordinates for 
Yondu’s ship.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Yondu enters with Rocket and Groot. 

YONDU

Release the quadrant.

KRAGLIN

Aye Capn’

INT. ECLECTOR SECURITY DOCK - OUTER SPACE

TASERFACE

I only ask one thing. That your 
High Priestess tells him the name 
of the man what sealed his fate: 
Taserface.

The CHAMBERMAID laughs uncontrollably at his name.

Taserface looks really sad as he EXPLODES.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

As Rocket and Groot, frightened, feel the SHIP EXPLODING 
around them, Kraglin pulls up one final latch - 

EXT. ECLECTOR - OUTER SPACE

THE ENTIRE REAR UPPER QUADRANT OF THE ECLECTOR DETACHES FROM 
THE REST OF THE SHIP, while the remains CONTINUE EXPLODING.

I/E. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Rocket and Groot are amazed as the SHIP thrusts forward, away 
from the explosions. 

Kraglin keys into a JUMP POINT ahead. Nearby, Rocket pulls up 
the Navigation panel.

KRAGLIN

Where to, Cap’n?

Rocket SETS THE DESTINATION:

ROCKET

Ego.

YONDU

NO, BOY!

The Quadrant TREMBLES as they hit THE JUMP POINT.  It BLOOPS
out of present space, making the JUMP to -

EXT. DESERT - DAY

The Quadrant POPS into a blue sky above a DESERT with two 
fighting KRONANS.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - VARIOUS OUTER SPACE LOCATIONS

Inside the ship, Rocket, Yondu, Kraglin, and baby Groot hold 
on for dear life as the ship VIOLENTLY SHAKES and THE 
LOCATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE WINDOW RAPIDLY SHIFT. 

Their bodies DISTEND SLIGHTLY. Yondu is furious.

YONDU

It ain’t healthy for a mammalian 
body to hop over fifty jumps at a 
time.

ROCKET

I know that.

YONDU

We’re about to do seven-hundred.

Rocket looks bummed.

EXT. PINK SKY - AMOEBA BLOBS - OUTER SPACE

The Quadrant pops out of a jump point into this Pepto Bismol
pink land, SMASHING THROUGH an AMOEBA-LIKE BLOB, and then 
through the next jump point.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - VARIOUS OUTER SPACE LOCATIONS

Kraglin, Yondu, Rocket, and Baby Groot all SCREAM, their 
entire faces and bodies distorting as if in some evil 
funhouse mirror.

EXT. RED PLANET LANDSCAPE - VARIOUS

The yellow sun CURVES SLOWLY WEST TO EAST over this 
magnificent landscape. 

“BRING IT ON HOME TO ME” BY SAM COOKE PLAYS.

EXT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - VERANDA - DAY

TILT DOWN to Quill, on this veranda, gazing out at the 
beauty.  The Walkman is connected to small, jerry-rigged
speakers nearby, PLAYING SAM COOKE.

Gamora isn’t paying attention. She’s fooling with a 
communications device, which has no reception.

GAMORA

Rocket? Rocket, you there?  Dammit.

Quill comes up behind her, messing with her.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

What are you doing, Peter?

QUILL

Dance with me.

GAMORA

No. I’m not --

QUILL

Come on. This is Sam Cooke, one of 
the greatest Earth singers of all 
time.

Gamora lets out an exasperated SIGH, but, reluctantly, starts 
DANCING with him. She is incredibly light on her feet. 

Quill smiles and Gamora, despite herself, does as well.  He 
TWIRLS HER AND BRINGS HER BACK IN. This is definitely not the 
first time they’ve done this.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Drax thinks you’re not a dancer.

GAMORA

If you ever tell anyone about this, 
I’ll kill you.

They look at each other. 

QUILL

When are we going to do something 
about this... unspoken thing 
between us?

GAMORA

What unspoken thing?

QUILL

This Cheers-Sam-and-Diane-guy-and-
girl-on-a-TV-show-who-dig-each-
other-but-never-say-it-’cause-when-
they-do-the-ratings-would-go-down 
sort of thing?

GAMORA

There is no unspoken thing between 
us. 

QUILL

Well, that’s a Catch-22. Because if 
you said there was, it would be 
spoken, and then you’d be a liar. 
So by saying there isn’t, you’re 
telling the truth, and admitting 
there is.

GAMORA

That’s not --

Gamora PULLS AWAY.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

What we should be discussing right 
now is that something about this 
place doesn’t feel right.

QUILL

What are you talking about? You 
were the one who wanted me to come 
here!

Gamora moves into --

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - DAY

GAMORA

That girl, Mantis. She’s afraid of 
something. 

Quill follows her.  He stops, staring at her, hurt and 
frustrated.

QUILL

Why are you trying to take this 
from me?

GAMORA

I’m not --

QUILL

He’s my father. He’s blood -

GAMORA

You have blood on earth. You never 
wanted to return there.

79

QUILL

Again - you made me come here!
And Earth?! Earth is the place my 
mother died in front of me. 

GAMORA

No, it’s because that’s real, and 
this is a fantasy.

QUILL

This is real. I’m only half human, 
remember?

GAMORA

That’s the half I’m worried about. 

QUILL

Oh, I get it. You’re jealous 
because I’m part god! You like me 
being the weak one!

Gamora adds some pieces to her transmitter.

GAMORA

Uh. You were insufferable to begin 
with. I haven’t been able to reach 
Rocket. I’m going to see if I can 
get a signal outside.

QUILL

You know, this isn’t Cheers after 
all. It’s whatever the show is 
where one person is willing to, you 
know, open themselves up to new 
possibilities, and the other person 
is just kind of a jerk who doesn’t 
trust anyone! It’s a show that 
doesn’t exist - it would never be 
made, it would be so horrible! It 
would get zero ratings!

GAMORA

You’re having a conversation with 
yourself! I don’t know what Cheers 
is!

QUILL

I finally found my family, don’t 
you understand that!?

GAMORA

I thought you already had.

QUILL

So this is how it ends, then? Our 
whole story. Like this? You and me?

GAMORA

Get it through your head, Peter. 
There is no you and me. There never 
was.

Quill watches her leave.

EXT. EGO’S FIELDS - SUNSET

Gamora sits, alone in the fields, pouting, fuming.  She 
stops, staring angrily inward.  

Two plants, nearby, flitter against one another in the wind, 
making a CLICKING sound. She side-eyes them. They don’t stop.  

She slices them off with her sword.

GAMORA

Dammit.

Gamora hears something. She turns to see, in the distance, an 
M-ship flying toward the planet.  

She watches as it gets closer and closer, and realizes it is 
FLYING DIRECTLY AT HER.

Gamora RUNS.

INT. NEBULA’S SHIP - SUNSET

Nebula HOLLERS as she BLASTS HER GUNS, DIVING towards Gamora. 

EXT. HILLSIDE - SUNSET

Gamora FLEES from Nebula’s ship like Cary Grant from the crop 
duster in North by Northwest as HUGE CHUNKS OF LAND EXPLODE 
on either side of her. 

Gamora leaps into a DITCH, LANDING HARD, as the M-Ship SWOOPS 
just a couple feet above her.

GAMORA

You psychopath.

Gamora sees the M-Ship banking and FLYING BACK at her again. 

She stands and runs along the hillside as GUN BLASTS burst 
behind her.  But Gamora sees a CAVERN, leading down into the 
earth.

81

© Marvel 


She DARTS into it.

INT. EGO’S CAVERN - FIRST/SECOND LEVELS - SUNSET

As Gamora RUNS down the cavern, she glances back over her 
shoulder where Nebula, insane with rage, continues FLYING 
towards her --

The M-SHIP ENTERS THE CAVERN, which is too small for it, 
CLIPPING ITS WINGS - but it keeps flying. It again BLASTS at 
Gamora as she FLEES - 

The BLASTS cause the ground to COLLAPSE around Gamora, and 
she FALLS, SMASHING DOWN THROUGH ONE LEVEL, to another level 
below, SLAMMING HARD on the ground. 

The underside of the M-ship gets SCRAPED APART as it flies 
above her, and pieces of it come RAINING DOWN around her.

Nebula ZOOMS towards a huge cavern wall.  She tries to turn 
her ship in time, to no avail.  

She SIDESWIPES it, falling down, CRASHING on the ground, 
where she is now on the same level as Gamora.

Gamora sees something beside her: it’s one of the ENORMOUS 
BLASTERS from the M-ship, attached to an AMMO RIG.

INT. NEBULA’S M-SHIP - SUNSET

Nebula sees Gamora, through the canopy, picking up the 
blaster, and clutching it. It is comically enormous. 

Nebula struggles to get free and out of the way, but her legs 
have been pinned in the crash - 

INT. EGO’S CAVERN - SECOND/THIRD LEVELS - SUNSET

Gamora CLAMPS two metal switches together, MACHINE-FIRING THE 
GUN, as she walks forward.  

The front of the M-ship is peppered with blasts and then 
EXPLODES. 

The explosion causes the thin ground around it to COLLAPSE, 
and the entire ship FALLS BACKWARDS to an even LOWER LEVEL - 
BURSTING some more as it hits the ground.

Gamora gazes down at the ship.

I/E. NEBULA’S SQUASHED M-SHIP - SUNSET

Nebula is a mess.  Her legs are broken, trapped in the ship.  
There is a FIRE at her feet.  

82

© Marvel 


She struggles, trying to get out, but her machine parts are 
SPARKING and she can hardly breathe. It seems as she’s going 
to die, when --

Part of the ship is TORN AWAY.  She sees Gamora.

Gamora GRABS HER, unceremoniously PULLING HER FREE, just as 
the M-ship EXPLODES, PITCHING THEM BOTH to the ground.

They lie next to each other. Nebula COUGHS as her legs are 
healing, CRACKING back into place.  

She looks over and eyes Gamora.  

And then she HOLLERS and attacks her.  

GAMORA

Are you kidding me?!

They FIGHT.

Nebula snatches Gamora’s blade from her, and TUMBLES on top 
of her as she gains the upper hand.  She holds the blade 
above Gamora, ready to plummet it into her. 

She wants to - she really does - but now that the moment is 
here...  

She SCREAMS in frustration, and falls back.

NEBULA

I win.

Gamora eyes her, a little surprised.

NEBULA (CONT’D)

I win. I bested you in combat.

GAMORA

Uh, no, I just spared your life -

NEBULA

You were stupid enough to let me 
live so - 

GAMORA

You just let me live!

NEBULA

I WIN!

GAMORA

Nebula, I really don’t need 
this. My day has been bad 
enough -

NEBULA (CONT'D)

I don’t need you always 
trying to beat me!

GAMORA

I’m not the one who just flew 
across the universe because I 
wanted to win!

NEBULA

Don’t tell me what I want!

GAMORA

I don’t have to because you make it 
obvi -

NEBULA

YOU WERE THE ONE WHO WANTED TO WIN, 
I JUST WANTED A SISTER!

Gamora stops suddenly, struck.  Nebula is cracking.

NEBULA (CONT’D)

You were all I had, but you were 
the one who needed to win! Thanos
pulled my eye from my head and my 
brain from my skull and my arm from 
my body because of you!

Gamora doesn’t know what to say. Nebula is almost instantly 
embarrassed. 

They sit there for a moment, saying nothing.

EXT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

The Quarters are entombed in stars. The dim sound of “BRANDY” 
comes from within.

INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

Quill lies in bed, unable to sleep, listening to the song.  

EGO (O.S.)

You all right, son?

Quill turns to see Ego in the doorway. 

EGO (CONT’D)

I saw your girl stomp off earlier 
in quite a huff.

Quill sits up, nods.

QUILL

Yeah.

Ego sits beside him.

EGO

It’s fortuitous you’re listening to 
this song.

QUILL

You know - ?

EGO

‘Brandy’ by Looking Glass.  A 
favorite of your mom’s. 

QUILL

Yes.

EGO

One of earth’s greatest musical 
compositions. Perhaps its very 
greatest.

QUILL

Yeah, it is.

EGO

You and I, Peter, we’re the sailor 
in the song.

Ego speaks along with the lyrics as they play.

EGO (CONT’D)

He came on a summer’s day, bringing 
gifts from far away - like the 
child I put in your mother, or the 
freedom you brought Gamora.

Quill listens.

EGO (CONT’D)

Brandy, you’re a fine girl, what a 
good wife you would be. But my 
life, my love, my lady is the sea.
The sea calls the sailor back.  He 
loves the girl, but that’s not his 
place.  The sea calls upon him as 
history calls upon great men, and 
sometimes we are deprived the 
pleasures of mortals.

QUILL

Well, you might not be mortal, but 
me - 

EGO

Death will remain a stranger to 
both of us as long as the light 
burns within the planet.

Ego smiles.

QUILL

I’m immortal? That’s... really?

EGO

Yes, as long as the light exists. 

QUILL

And I can use the light to make 
cool things? Like how you made all 
this?

EGO

It’ll take thousands of years of 
practice before you get really good 
at it . But, yes. 

QUILL

Well, get ready for an eight 
hundred foot statue of Pac Man, 
then. With Skeletor. And Heather 
Locklear. I’m gonna make some weird 
shit.

Ego puts his arm around him, smiles kindly.

EGO

I can’t wait to see your weird 
shit.

QUILL

Wow, that...

EGO

Came out a little disgusting.

They CHUCKLE.

EGO (CONT’D)

It is a tremendous responsibility, 
Peter. Only we can remake the 
universe. Only we can take the 
bridle of the cosmos and lead it 
where it needs to go.

QUILL

How?

Ego holds up his fingers, letting forth a flame of white 
cosmic light. Quill holds up his fingers, letting forth a 
smaller, less intense flame of white cosmic light.

REVEAL MANTIS, IN THE HALL, around the corner, looking at Ego 
and Quill and the light emanating from their fingers.

EGO

Come with me.

Mantis looks like she’s having a panic attack.

INT. DRAX’S SLEEPING QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

CLOSE-UP OF DRAX, sound asleep.

MANTIS (O.S.)

Drax! Drax!

He WAKES to see a panicked Mantis sitting on the bed beside 
him.

MANTIS (CONT’D)

Drax, we need to talk -

DRAX

Ugh. I am sorry, but I like a woman 
with some meat on her bones.

MANTIS

What?

DRAX

I tried to let you down easily by 
telling you I found you disgusting.

MANTIS

No! That’s not what I - 

Drax starts to GAG. 

MANTIS (CONT’D)

What are you doing?!

DRAX

I’m imagining being with you 
physically!

MANTIS

Drax, that’s not - I don’t like you 
like that. I don’t even like the 
type of thing you are. 

DRAX

(offended)

Hey! There’s no need to get 
personal!

MANTIS

Listen! Ego’s gotten exactly what 
he wanted. I should have told you 
earlier, I am stupid. You are in 
danger. 

EXT. NEBULA’S SQUASHED M-SHIP - NIGHT

Gamora and Nebula still sit here, quietly and awkwardly.  
Gamora glances down a twisting tunnel, where phosphorescent 
lights shine brightly.

GAMORA

What’s that?

She moves towards it.  Nebula, hesitantly, follows.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

Ego and Quill enter the palace. 

EGO

You need to readjust the way you 
process life. Everything around us - 
including the girl - is temporary. 
We are forever.

QUILL

Doesn’t eternity get boring?

EGO

Not if you have a purpose, Peter. 
Which is why you’re here. I told 
you how all those years ago I had 
an unceasing impulse to find life.

Ego is standing underneath the diorama of him facing the 
little alien girl.

EGO (CONT’D)

I didn’t tell you how when I did 
find it, it was all so... 
disappointing.

INT. TWISTING CAVERNS - NIGHT

Gamora and Nebula move further down the cavern, stepping into 
light, getting closer.

EGO

And that is when I came to a 
profound realization. 

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

EGO

My innate desire to seek out other 
life was not so that I could walk 
among that life. 

Ego looks at his son, moved by the memories.  

EGO (CONT’D)

Peter, I had found meaning.

Quill is taken aback. But Ego sets his finger lightly on his 
forehead, and the white light bursts through his son’s body. 

We see THE COSMOS IN QUILL’S EYES. He looks ecstatic, far 
beyond where he stands, and seems to finally understand.

QUILL

I see it. Eternity.

INT. TWISTING CAVERNS - NIGHT

Gamora and Nebula stop, in horror.

GAMORA

Oh my God.

They are staring at piles and piles of skeletons of various 
species, thousands of them, seeming to go on forever.

NEBULA

We need to get off this planet.

EXT. GALAXY/UNIVERSE - OUTER SPACE

We see traces of the UNIVERSAL NEURAL TELEPORTATION NETWORK, 
the Quadrant a blinking light POPPING IN and OUT on a trail 
across the cosmos -

And then ZOOM BACK FURTHER TO THE UNIVERSE, the same blinking 
light making its way while ROCKET, YONDU, and KRAGLIN SCREAM.

EXT. ASTEROIDS - OUTER SPACE

WATCHERS swirl to the Quadrant SWISH past them and JUMPS OUT. 

They turn back to STAN LEE, in a spacesuit with a fishbowl 
helmet.

STAN LEE

Anyway, before I was so rudely 
interrupted, that time I was a 
World War II vet - 

EXT. RED PLANET - OUTER SPACE

THE QUADRANT POPS INTO SPACE, EGO’S PLANET nearby.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Yondu, Kraglin, Rocket and Groot FALL OUT OF THEIR SEATS, 
RETCHING, clutching their stomachs. 

YONDU

What the hell you doing, boy?!

ROCKET

I could tell by how you talked 
about him - this Ego is bad news. 
We’re here to save Quill.

YONDU

For what?

(derisively)

For ‘honor’? For ‘love’?

ROCKET

No! I don’t care about those 
things! I want to save Quill so I 
can prove I’m better than him! I 
can lord this over him forever!

Yondu LAUGHS bitterly as he pulls himself up to the controls. 
Rocket yanks himself up beside him.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

What are you laughing at me for?!

YONDU

You can fool yourself and everyone 
else but you can’t fool me. I know 
who you are.

ROCKET

You don’t know anything about me, 
loser.

YONDU

I know everything about you. I know 
you play like the meanest and the 
hardest ‘cause you actually the 
most scared of all.

ROCKET

Shut up.

YONDU

I know you steal batteries you 
don’t need and you push away anyone 
who’s willing to put up with you, 
‘cause just a little bit of love 
reminds you how big and empty that 
hole inside you actually is! 

ROCKET

I said, shut up.

YONDU

I know the scientists what made you 
never gave a rat’s ass about you -

ROCKET

I’m serious, dude - !

YONDU

Just like my own damn parents, who 
sold me, their own little baby, 
into slavery! I know who you are, 
boy, because you’re me.

They stare at each other there, a mirror. 

ROCKET

What kind of pair are we?

YONDU

The kind that’s about to go fight a 
planet I reckon.

ROCKET

All right, okay, that’s - Wait. 
Fight a what?

INT. DRAX’S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

Gamora, furious, BURSTS into the room.  She sees Mantis 
standing with Drax. 

She RUNS to her, GRABBING HER by the neck --

DRAX

Hey!

And she SLAMS her against the wall.

GAMORA

Who are you people?! What is this 
place?!

DRAX

(re: Nebula)

What is she doing here?

NEBULA

Just watching the fireworks.

DRAX

Gamora, let her go! 

GAMORA

The bodies in the caverns, who are 
they?!

MANTIS

You are scared.

Gamora, whose skin is touching Mantis, lets go of her neck, 
terrified. 

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

The DIORAMAS all around Quill and Ego TRANSFORM into a map of 
the universe.  Quill stares in his cosmic reverie at the 
PLANETS around him - thousands of them with pieces of EGO’S 
LIFEFORM - GLOWING COSMIC PLANTS - buried within them.

EGO

I call it the Expansion. It is my 
purpose. And now it’s yours as 
well. 

QUILL

It’s beautiful.

Quill stares up at a DIORAMA: Ego grabs handfuls of his own 
body, engulfed in light, and plants the wriggling pieces on 
various planets. 

EGO

Over thousands of years I implanted 
thousands of extensions of myself 
on thousands of worlds. 

92

© Marvel 


In the DIORAMAS, the COSMIC PLANTS OVERGROW and COVER each of 
the planets, like chocolate on a malt ball.

EGO (CONT’D)

I needed to fulfill life’s one true 
purpose: to grow and to spread, 
covering all that exists, until 
everything... is me.

INT. DRAX’S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

Gamora backs away, recovering.

GAMORA

What did she do to me?!

DRAX

She already told me everything.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

EGO

I only had one problem. A single 
Celestial doesn’t have enough power 
for such an enterprise. But two 
Celestials - well now, that just 
might do.

INT. DRAX’S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

MANTIS

The bodies are his children.

Gamora is horrified.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

On the DIORAMAS we see Ego with hundreds of species of female 
aliens.

EGO

Out of all my labors the most 
beguiling was attempting to graft 
my DNA with that of another 
species. I hoped the result of such 
a coupling would be enough to power 
the expansion.

INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

Yondu and Rocket walk here.

93

EGO (O.S.)

I had Yondu deliver some of them to 
me. It broke the Ravager code - but 
I compensated him generously. And, 
to ease his conscience, I told him 
I would never hurt them.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

EGO

That was true. They never felt a 
thing. But, one after the other, 
they failed me. None of them had 
the Celestial genes. Until you, 
Peter. Out of all my spawn, only 
you have carried the connection to 
the light. 

Peter smiles, an enchanted idiot, the cosmos in his eyes.

INT. DRAX’S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT 

GAMORA

We need to find Peter now and get 
off this damn planet.

MANTIS

Ego will have won him to his side 
by now. He has a way of - 

NEBULA

Then we just go.

GAMORA

No. He’s our friend.

NEBULA 

All any of you do is yell at each 
other. You’re not friends.

DRAX

You’re right. We’re family. 
We leave no one behind. 

(To Nebula)

Except maybe you.

For the first time in my life, I am 
truly not alone.

Quill suddenly looks sad.

EGO (CONT’D)

What is it, son?

QUILL

My friends.

EGO

That’s the mortal in you, Peter.

QUILL

Yes. I don’t need that.

EGO

What are we?

QUILL

Forever.

EGO

What are they?

QUILL

Temporary.

EGO

You think you love them. But love 
is merely an evolutionary trick in 
the service of reproduction. We are 
beyond such things.

QUILL

Yes.

EGO

Now - 

QUILL

But my mother.

Ego looks at him, questioningly.

QUILL (CONT’D)

You said you loved my mother.

EGO

That I did. My river lily, who knew 
the words to every song that came 
on the radio. I returned to earth 
to see her three times. I knew if I 
came back a fourth, I’d never 
leave.

The expansion, the reason for my 
very existence would be over.  So I 
did what I had to do. But it broke 
my heart to put that tumor in her 
head. 

QUILL

Wh- what?

ZOLLY IN ON QUILL as the cosmos disappear from his eyes. 
Tears stream down his face.

EGO

I know that sounds bad - 

QUILL PULLS OUT HIS PISTOLS AND FIRES; THE BLAST TEARS 
THROUGH EGO, DISPERSING the MOLECULES forming his body.  

Quill SHOOTS at him AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN.  The flesh 
disappears from Ego like bites from a cookie, exposing the 
angry alien skeletal form beneath. 

But, as the charge on Peter’s blasters wears out, Ego just 
looks at him, and, although he’s filled with holes, he’s 
merely disappointed.

EGO (CONT’D)

Who in the hell do you think you 
are?

QUILL

You killed my mother!

EGO TRANSFORMS into DAVID HASSELHOFF.

EGO

I tried so hard to find the form 
that best suited you, and this is 
the thanks I get?

And then, once again, BECOMES HIS USUAL FORM.

EGO (CONT’D)

You really need to grow up.

A SPIKY COSMIC LIGHT-PROPELLED TENDRIL SHOOTS UP from the 
floor behind Quill, and JUTS into Quill’s body.  

Quill is THRUST INTO THE AIR.  He opens his mouth to SCREAM 
and WHITE LIGHT EMITS.

a battery, ‘Star-Lord’.

INT. DRAX’S SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

THROUGH THE WINDOW to the PALACE - PAN TO Gamora watching as 
her TRANSMITTER - the one she was trying to contact Rocket on 
- BEEPS.  She answers.

GAMORA

Rocket?!

Gamora follows Drax, Nebula, and a confused Mantis as they 
move out.

INT. LASER DRILL - OUTER SPACE

Rocket, Yondu, and Groot are CRAWLING into a huge LASER 
DRILL.  

ROCKET

Keep that transmitter nearby so I 
can find you. We’re in an old piece 
of construction equipment Yondu 
once used to slice open the Bank of 
A’askavaria.

GAMORA (O.S.)

ROCKET

I know. Get ready.

YONDU

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Kraglin YANKS a lever. 

I/E. LASER DRILL - OUTER SPACE

An ugly, bulbous and uneven craft PLOPS from the Quadrant, 
and heads toward Ego’s surface.

ROCKET

I got a plan.

YONDU

What is it?

ROCKET

It’s pretty simple.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

Ego walks calmly up beside the trapped Quill. He snatches the 
Walkman off of him. He stares at it. Quill can barely speak.

QUILL

NO.

EGO PRESSES PLAY.  A distorted version of “Brandy” plays.  He 
stares at it - perhaps he’s feeling wistful sadness, or 
perhaps nothing at all.

‘Brandy, you’re a fine girl. What a good wife you would be.’

EGO

‘My life, my love, my lady is the 
sea’? Peter, THIS IS THE SEA.

EGO CRUSHES THE WALKMAN IN HIS GRIP as Quill watches 
helplessly.  

The POWER SURGES from Quill through the TENTACLE and 
throughout the entire PALACE --

EXT. PALACE - NIGHT

As Gamora, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula run toward the Palace it 
BURSTS WITH COSMIC LIGHT, so brightly they have to protect 
their eyes.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

EGO basks in the power and we TRAVEL down his legs --

INT. RED PLANET/SELF CHAMBER - NIGHT

We FOLLOW THE ENERGY THROUGH THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET --

THROUGH THE TWISTING VEINS OF LIGHT BENEATH -- 

And INTO an ENORMOUS, METAL ORB, the SELF CHAMBER, which 
EXPLODES WITH LIGHT.  

Boom.

EARTH - EXT. WOODS BEHIND DAIRY QUEEN - MOMENTS LATER

We PUSH INTO the small plant - now a bit larger - that Ego 
planted at the very beginning of the film. 

It LIGHTS UP and GROWS, INSTANTLY BURSTING UPWARDS -

EARTH - EXT. DQ - MOMENTS LATER

The PLANT BURSTS UP BEHIND the Dairy Queen (now a modern DQ), 
a huge ORGANIC, BLOB-LIKE MASS OF LIGHT that comes down 
instantly on the building, CRUSHING it and everyone inside --

AND CONTINUING TO SPILL FORWARD, SPREADING.

INT. PALACE - NIGHT

EGO SUMMONS all his energy, when, SUDDENLY, a DOOR beside him 
SMASHES APART. 

Drax has kicked through it and Gamora, Nebula and Mantis are 
with him. Ego turns to see them, then hears a RUMBLING above 
him.

He turns to look at a window on the palace wall behind him.

AND THE GIANT LASER DRILL COMES SMASHING THROUGH THE PALACE 
WALL. 

YONDU

Hey there, Jackass.

Ego looks surprised.

The LASER DRILL lands on Ego, SQUASHING HIM. 

The tendril retracts from Quill as he falls and heaves for 
breath.

EARTH - EXT. STREET - DAY

The cosmic plant, barreling down the street, suddenly STOPS.

INT. PALACE/LASER DRILL - SUNRISE

Drax, Gamora, Nebula, and Mantis rush into the crumbling 
palace.

The door on the side of the Laser Drill SLIDES OPEN. Baby 
Groot is standing there, smiling, and waving. 

DRAX

Out of the way, dumber, smaller 
Groot.

As Drax crawls in, Groot starts PUNCHING Drax as hard as he 
can. Probably because he called him dumb, but who’s to say.

Gamora helps up Quill.

GAMORA

I told you something didn’t feel

‘I told you so.’ That’s really what

Because there’s an unspoken thing.

GAMORA

There is no unspoken thing.

INT. LASER DRILL - NIGHT

Drax, Mantis, Gamora, and Quill step inside the door.

DRAX

What are you doing? You could have 
killed us all crashing in here like 
that!

Uh, ‘Thank you, Rocket’?

all around the drill.

DRAX

How do we kill a Celestial?

QUILL

There’s the center to him - his 
brain, his soul, whatever it is, in 
some sort of shell --

It’s in the caverns below the 
surface.

We can’t. Ego wants to eradicate 
the universe as we know it. We have 
to kill him.

They PLUMMET toward a fissure in the earth below.  It’s too 
small for the ship.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Rocket!

ROCKET

Got it.

Rocket BLASTS the lasers perfectly, CHIPPING AWAY PIECES of 
rock, forming an opening in the crack.

They SMASH into the opening, barely fitting, leading down 
into the planet. 

Quill flies perfectly, TWISTING through tunnels and around 
corners.  

Rocket mans the lasers, BLASTING PIECES OUT OF PLACE just in 
time so they can SCRAPE through.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

So, we’re saving the galaxy again?

QUILL

I guess.

ROCKET

Awesome. We’ll really be able to 
jack up our prices if we’re two-

out in the distance of space.  He looks a bit closer.

SOVEREIGN OMNICRAFT ARE POPPING THROUGH JUMP POINTS ABOVE 
EGO’S PLANET.

EXT. AYESHA’S SPACECRAFT - OUTER SPACE

AYESHA is remotely piloting one of the ships.  She looks 
determined and angry on the vid-screen. 

And, one by one, Sovereign OMNICRAFT POP IN all around her, 
until there is a large fleet.  

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

Ayesha, in full pilot gear, yells into her comm.

Yondu doesn’t hear the CRACKLING SPEAKER beside him as they 
maneuver down through the fissure. Quill eyes him.

YONDU

So why’d Ego want you here? 

QUILL

He needs my genetic connection to 
the light to help destroy the 
universe. He tried to teach me how 
to control the power.

YONDU

So could you? 

QUILL

A little. I made a ball.

As the SCREECH through a smaller space and into --

INT. PLANET’S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY

The Laser Drill DROPS into this enormous open space within 
the planet.  

The Guardians gather on the side of the ship open to the 
hollow, gazing out at its stunning beauty, lit by Ego’s white 
glow running throughout it.  

GAMORA

Whoa.

Mantis turns, looking through the portholes on the other 
side.

There! Thats Ego’s core.

Mantis points at the Self Chamber, down below them.  They 
twist down towards it.

GAMORA

That ore’s thick. Rocket, we’re 
gonna need to use the big laser.

Rocket nods, FLICKS switches. 

All the small lasers on the sides move through grooves to 
combine into one huge laser in the center of the ship: the 
MEGA-LASER.

long to find us.

Quill steadies the craft as best he can beside the Self 
Chamber.  But it’s an unwieldy beast, built for power, not 
precision. 

Rocket powers up the mega-laser and holds tight to the 
SHUDDERING CONTROLS as it DRILLS, BURNING a HOLE into the 
protective sheathe. It melts and drips down.

QUILL

We drill into the center, we kill 
him.

Quill holds tight to the steering wheel. Yondu notices the
BLINKING LIGHT on the comm. He taps it.

Yeah, why?

Yondu looks out the window where AYESHA’S SQUADRON is 
SWOOPING OUT OF the cracks in the ceiling all around them.

Aw, hell.

Quill PULLS AWAY from the envoys.

But the Sovereign envoys start BLASTING AT THE CRAFT all at 
once; the LASER LOSES POWER and the VEHICLE TURNS SIDEWAYS - 

Drax, Mantis, and Gamora GO TUMBLING from the hole in the 
side. Nebula and Groot grab onto the floor.

INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Gamora, Drax, and Mantis FALL from an incredible height. They 
LAND - ONE, TWO, THREE - WITH APLOMB.  

Gamora looks up and sees the Laser Drill CURL behind the Self 
Chamber as it tries to avoid the envoys’ BLASTERS. 

INT. SELF CHAMBER/LASER DRILL - DAY

Rocket shows Nebula the Anulax batteries.

Quill leaves the controls to Yondu as he CLIMBS down beside 
Rocket, now messing with wiring on his BOMB.

QUILL

Is it strong enough to kill Ego?

ROCKET

If it is, it will cause a chain 
reaction throughout his entire 
nervous system.

QUILL

Meaning what?

ROCKET

The entire planet will explode. 
We’ll have to get out of here fast.
I rigged a timer.

Rocket stuffs the bomb back in his satchel.  Groot climbs on 
his back.  

Rocket and Quill slap on their AERO RIGS.

QUILL

Go!

The run and jump out of the laser drill, FLYING ON THEIR AERO 
RIGS, avoiding the GUNFIRE.

The ZOOM towards the blast hole on the side of the self 
chamber.

INT. OPENING OF BLAST HOLE - DAY

Rocket and Quill land here, messily, TUMBLING.

INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Mantis is worried about something else entirely; the entire 
chasm begins TREMBLING and the walls start to MUTATE.  

MANTIS

He’s coming.

DRAX

Didn’t you say you could make him 
sleep?

MANTIS

When he wants! He’s too powerful! I 
can’t!

DRAX

You don’t have to believe in 
yourself because I believe in you.

They look ahead. They see, on the enormous wall in front of 
them, the LIGHT-FORM of a giant EGO SCREAMING ANGRILY.

His SCREAM becomes a TUNNEL OF ROCKS RUSHING TOWARDS THEM 
like a train.

Mantis sees a nerve bundle on the ground coming from Ego’s 
Core. Although afraid, she grabs it.

MANTIS

SLEEP!

She SCREAMS with effort and some pain as energy travels 
through the bundle and into the core, where it darkens.

The LIGHT LEAVES THE ROCK FORMATION and it SLAMS into the 
ground in front of them, SPLASHING DIRT OVER THEM. 

But they are safe, shivering. Drax and Gamora look at each 
other.

DRAX

I never thought she’d be able to do 
it. With as skinny and weak as she 
appears to be.

Mantis’s arm is TREMBLING.

MANTIS

I don’t know how long I can hold 
him!

GAMORA

You need to, girl. If you don’t 
keep Ego at bay, we all die.

INT. OPENING OF BLAST HOLE - DAY

Rocket shines a powerful PEN-LIGHT inside the cavity, 
exposing the interior, spattered with Swiss-cheese-like holes 
glowing with light. 

ROCKET

The metal is too thick! For the 
bomb to work we’d actually need to 
place it on Ego’s core.  And our 
fat butts ain’t gonna fit through 
those tiny holes.

QUILL

Well...

Quill slowly eyes Groot, who is playing with a leaf on his 
arm and thinking about something else entirely. 

ROCKET

That’s a terrible idea.

QUILL

Which is the only kind of idea we 
got left.

Rocket SIGHS. He puts Groot on his back and MOVES with Groot 
deeper into the blast hole, mumbling to himself:

ROCKET

Unbelievable. ‘Rocket, do this. 
Rocket, do that.’

Quill turns toward the opening. PUSH UP AND IN ON QUILL.

QUILL

Uh, what a day.

He jumps out into the fray.

INT. PLANET’S HOLLOW - DAY

Quill FLIES UP as a ship FLIES in toward him BLASTING, and 
he’s about to fire back.  MAN VS. SPACESHIP. This is most 
likely the beginning of the biggest, baddest fight scene 
ever, but instead we CUT TO -

110

© Marvel 


INT. INSIDE BLAST HOLE - DAY

Quiet. Blasts in the deep background. Rocket places a tiny 
bomb in front of Groot.  It is a small, simple device with 
two switches and two buttons.  He explains, very carefully:

ROCKET

All right. First you flick this 
switch, then this switch. That 
activates it.  And then you push 
this button, which will give you 
five minutes to get out of there. 
Whatever you do don’t push this 
button, because that will set off 
the bomb immediately, and we’ll all 
be dead. Now repeat back what I 
just said.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

Uh huh.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

That’s right.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

No! That’s the button that will 
kill everyone! Try again.

Groot thinks.

GROOT

I am Groot.

Rocket nods.

GROOT (CONT’D)

I am Groot.

Rocket nods.

GROOT (CONT’D)

I am Groot.

ROCKET

No! That’s exactly what you just 
said! How is that even possible?! 
Which button is the button you’re 
supposed to push?! Point to it.

Groot thinks. And he points to the one that will kill 
everyone.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

NO!!!

QUILL (O.S.)

Hey, you’re making him nervous!

Rocket runs to see, at the end of the hole, a sliver of the 
outside as Quill peeks in while SHOOTING at envoys.

ROCKET

Shut up! And give me some tape! 
Does anyone have any tape out 
there!? I want to put some tape 
over the death button!

QUILL

I don’t have any tape.  Let me 
check.

Quill disappears from the hole.  As Rocket waits, he hears, 
amongst the chaos, faintly -

QUILL (O.S.) (CONT’D)

Yo, Yondu, do you have any - ow! - 
do you have any tape?!

O.S. GUN BLASTS.

We hear VOICES GRUMBLING.

Rocket and Groot look around, waiting. Rocket is impatient. 
He coughs. Groot is like a bored kid in a waiting room.  He 
shifts around and plays with the wires on the bomb. 

Quill reappears outside the hole, SHOOTING an envoy.

QUILL (CONT’D)

No one has any tape.

ROCKET

Not a single person has tape?

112

© Marvel 


QUILL

You have priceless batteries and an 
atomic bomb in your bag! If anyone 
had tape it would be you!

ROCKET

That’s exactly my point! I have to 
do everything!

QUILL

Dude, you’re wasting time!

Rocket turns back to Groot, who has already taken the bomb 
and is heading towards the hole. 

He makes a “WHEEEEEE” sound and smiles brightly as he HOPS 
into the hole and SLIDES down as if on a water slide.

Rocket, heavy-lidded, watches him go.

ROCKET

We’re all gonna die.

INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY

Yondu and Nebula, in the cockpit, are being overcome as 
blasts come through the walls.

YONDU

We’re done for without the 
generator.

Nebula MOANS, frustrated. She flips open a section of the 
dashboard, then a part of her arm.

INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY

The remaining Sovereign envoys have ENCIRCLED the battered 
Laser Drill, BLASTING IT TO BITS.  

Quill FLIES into the Laser Drill, SLAMMING into the wall.

AYESHA (ON SHIP)

Guardians! Perhaps it will provide 
you solace that your deaths are not 
without purpose.  

Nebula is feeding the wires from the craft into her 
mechanical arm. 

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

The actual Ayesha, fitted with the pilot gear, looks at the 
Laser Drill on the screen.

AYESHA

They will serve as a warning to all 
of those tempted with betraying us; 
don’t screw with the Sovereign. 

INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY

Yondu works some switches: The LASERS slide back into the 
slots all over the ship.

YONDU

This is gonna hurt.

NEBULA

Promises, promises.

Yondu flips ALL the switches; ALL THE POWER RUNS PAINFULLY 
OUT OF NEBULA’S BODY INTO THE VEHICLE --

AND THE LASERS BEAM OUT OF THE SHIP IN ALL DIRECTIONS AT 
ONCE, like a dangerous disco ball, slicing through almost 
nearly every single ENVOY.

INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

A BEAM ALMOST HITS Drax, but he LEAPS out of the way.  Smoke 
rises from a hole in the ground between him and Mantis.

DRAX

Hey! 

INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY

With flair, Yondu spins the pilot’s wheel, so that the whole 
rig REVOLVES.

Ayesha looks on, in horror as the BEAMS SLICE THROUGH the 
remaining CRAFT - and one is COMING HER WAY.

AYESHA (ON SHIP)

NO!!

AYESHA’S ENVOY IS RIPPED APART.

INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY

Ayesha SITS BACK. She looks around her at the other pods: all 
of them are down.  

AYESHA

NO! NOOOOO!!

INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY

Quill sees FLAMING CHUNKS FLY into the rig...

And FIRE SPILLING toward the ship’s engine, dripping fuel.

QUILL

We’re gonna blow!

Yondu WHISTLES as the FLAMES HIT THE FUEL -

INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Gamora watches as the ENTIRE LASER DRILL EXPLODES.  She is 
stricken. 

GAMORA

Peter?

She sees a tiny body flying from the ship - it’s Nebula, who 
LANDS across from her on her feet.  

Gamora looks at her, worried.  Nebula gives her what might be 
a little smile, and looks upward. Gamora follows her line of 
sight.

Quill is FLYING FROM THE EXPLOSION on his aero-rig. Yondu is 
holding onto a flying arrow: his one arm up straight, his 
heels touching. Quill looks at him and SNICKERS.

YONDU

What?

QUILL

You look like Mary Poppins.

YONDU

Is he cool?

Quill looks at the man who raised him. He smiles.

QUILL

Yeah. He’s cool.

Yondu looks out at the Guardians as he comes in for a 
landing.

YONDU

I’m Mary Poppins, y’all!

Quill and Yondu LAND beside Nebula. Gamora sees Quill and 
MARCHES TOWARD HIM. 

115

The CAMERA CIRCLES GAMORA AND QUILL, FIERY SHIP FRAGMENTS 
RAINING DOWN AROUND THEM IN SLOW-MOTION, as if this is the 
greatest heavy metal video of all time. 

The other Guardians enter, one by one - Nebula, Drax, Yondu, 
Rocket FLYING DOWN on his aero-rig, and finally, Mantis, 
staring forward with concentration until --

A HUGE CHUNK OF SPACESHIP FLIES IN FROM THE SIDE, FLATTENING 
MANTIS. The others all look down at her in shock.

QUILL

Oh. Wow.

Mantis, UNCONSCIOUS BENEATH a ship fragment, has lost hold of 
Ego.

THE ENTIRE HOLLOW AROUND THEM BEGINS TO RUMBLE.  THE GROUND 
AND WALLS THEMSELVES SHIFT and WAVER.  

The whole cavity is alive. Drax checks on Mantis.

DRAX

She’s just unconscious.

INT. SELF CHAMBER TUNNELS - DAY

Groot RUNS and HOPS through the tunnels. He comes to a 
crossroads.

He sees a COSMIC LIGHT emanating from one tunnel.  He dashes 
off toward it.

INT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

QUILL

How long before the bomb goes off?

ROCKET

In the unlikely event Groot doesn’t 
kill us all, about six minutes.

Yondu speaks into the comm on his lapel.

YONDU

Kraglin.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Kraglin, NODDING OUT, abruptly wakes.

YONDU (O.S.)

We need the Quadrant for extraction 
in T-minus five minutes.

KRAGLIN

Aye, Cap’n!

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Our heroes peer up to see the SURFACE OF THE PLANET UNFOLDING 
ABOVE THEM, so that THE BRIGHT SKY SHINES THROUGH.  

QUILL

Someone needs to be up top when 
Kraglin arrives. Drax, take Mantis.

Drax nods. He picks up Mantis.  Quill grabs the aero-rig off 
himself and SLAPS it on Drax’s back, which AUTOMATICALLY 
WRAPS around his upper body.

DRAX

Ahhh! My nipples!

He FLIES UPWARD.

The ground around them SPLITS INTO ENORMOUS CRACKS. Gamora 
sees a CRACK IN THE EARTH RUSHING TOWARD her and Quill, and 
she turns toward him.

And Gamora’s side CRUMBLES AWAY, GAMORA FALLING DOWN with it.

QUILL

Gamora!!

HUGE BURSTS OF EARTH SHOOT UP all around Drax, Yondu, Rocket, 
and Quill.  

The planet has formed GIANT TENTACLES THAT HURTLE towards our 
heroes.

EXT. LOWER RIFT - DAY

Gamora is PLUMMETING, seemingly to her death, when she looks 
over and sees Nebula FALLING just behind her.  

Nebula grabs Gamora’s arm and then grabs onto a passing 
cliff.  

They SNAP TO A STOP- OW! - hanging down off the side.  

Nebula tosses Gamora up onto a flat surface. 

As Nebula climbs up after her, Gamora looks at her, wary but 
surprised by this beneficence.

NEBULA

Oh, get over it.

117

© Marvel 


EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Quill BLASTS a tentacle. 

Yondu WHISTLES, the ARROW WEAVING THROUGH TENTACLES around 
them.  

Rocket TOSSES a bunch of tiny bombs at some, which they stick 
to and EXPLODE. 

But they are by no means winning this fight.

EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY

The giant Quadrant LOWERS toward the surface. 

EXT. LOWER RIFT - DAY

Gamora looks at Nebula.

GAMORA

We have to get up to the extraction 
point!

They look over the edge and see a huge RIFT OF LAND RISING 
QUICKLY.  They look at each other and JUMP -

They GRAB ONTO THE EDGE of the rising rift, CLUTCHING TO IT 
as it FLIES upward toward the open space above them.

EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY

Drax FLIES UP onto the surface; he sees the Quadrant waiting 
for him there.  He DARTS for the ship.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Kraglin opens the LOADING DOOR

EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY

But huge swatches of the planet reach up and GRAB onto the 
Quadrant, YANKING IT DOWN.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - DAY

Kraglin, freaking out, throws the thrusters into high gear.

I/E. PLANET SURFACE/QUADRANT LOADING BAY - DAY

The thrusters FLARE as the massive ship STRUGGLES to free 
itself from Ego’s tendrils.  

118

© Marvel 


And it does PULL ITSELF UP for a moment, but the tendrils 
tighten, SLAMMING it back down.

The whole Quadrant starts to TIP OVER. Kraglin falls down 
against the side of the ship.

Drax sees the ship FALLING TOWARDS HIM and he RUNS away from 
it in fear.

But he arrives a the edge of a cliff.  He crouches as the 
ship CONTINUES DOWN toward him, about to SQUASH both he and 
Mantis --

But Kraglin heroically CRAWLS his way back up to the controls 
as he dangles from them.  He pushes on the thrusters, so that 
the ship goes back upright.

Drax turns and again RUNS toward the Quadrant.

EXT. PLANET’S HOLLOW - DAY

Gamora and Nebula are still rising on the rift when they SLAM 
into a wall near the opening in the surface of the planet. 

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Quill turns and sees Ego, in his terrifying SKELETAL LIGHT 
FORM, STROLLING DOWN TOWARDS HIM as the land around him PARTS 
LIKE THE RED SEA. 

As Ego walks, THE DIRT AND MOLECULES AROUND EGO FORM ORGANS 
IN HIS BODY, piecing himself back together.

Quill sees a tentacle SLAM Yondu to the ground and COVER HIS 
ENTIRE BODY.  

He turns to see Rocket HOLLERING as he FIRES at tentacles, 
but they OVERWHELM him. 

EXT. PLANET SURFACE - DAY

The earth WRAPS AROUND Drax’s legs like quicksand, pulling 
him and Mantis down into it.

EXT. PLANET’S HOLLOW - DAY

Gamora and Nebula scramble, trying to CLIMB BACK UP, when 
TENDRILS WRAP AROUND THEM, stopping them from going further.

INT. SELF CHAMBER TUNNELS - DAY

The walls are tightening around Groot. He grows his branches 
to try to stop them, but they aren’t working.

He begins to CRY, like an actual baby, terrified, on the 
brink of suffocating.

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Ego approaches his son. He is fully formed, and he is more 
truly “himself.” Alien. Dark eyes and pale skin.

EGO

I told you I don’t want to do this 
alone. 

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

EGO

You cannot deny the purpose the 
universe has bestowed upon you!

And once again, the LIGHT TENDRILS STAB THROUGH QUILL’S BACK, 
thrusting him to his knees.  

Smaller light tendrils stab into his face and body.

And we see the LIGHT being sucked out of Quill and up into 
the Self Chamber once more as it BURSTS WITH LIGHT.

EARTH - EXT. STREET - DAY

POLICE OFFICERS and bystanders are in the streets, snapping 
phone photos, etc, beside the HUGE, STILL SWATCH OF EGO’S 
LIFEFORM.

OFFICER FITZGIBBON

Please, everyone. Step back. I need 
you all to clear the -

WEIRD OLD MAN

What is that?

The LIFEFORM ALIGHTS WITH ENERGY and MOVES again, SPILLING
INCREDIBLY QUICKLY towards them.

People abandon their cars in traffic as it RUNS OVER THEM. 

A WOMAN FALLS. People TRAMPLE around her.  

But an old man’s hands reach in, helping her up. 

REVEAL GRANDPA QUILL, in his 70’s or 80’s now. 

GRANDPA QUILL

Come on, ma’am.

He HELPS the woman into an SUV.

He SLAMS on the gas, SCREECHING AWAY from the enormous tidal 
wave of organic light.

street.

KREE MONKS run from the cosmic flesh as it pours down the 
hillside behind them. 

But it’s too fast, RUSHING OVER THEM.

THOUSANDS OF ORLONI are darting in fear across this dusty 
desert, as it WASHES OVER them.

EASIK - EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

AN EASIK MOTHER clutches her BABY, covering it with her own 
body, as the spreading lifeform LOOMS UP behind her.

She closes her eyes and waits for the worst.

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Quill looks up at Ego, barely able to focus, as the molecules 
form skin over the muscle and skeleton and innards beneath.  

EGO

What greater meaning could life 
possibly have to offer?!

Yondu struggles beneath the tentacle beside Quill.

YONDU

I don’t use my head to fly the 
arrow, boy! I use my h -

Quill hears this as the earth COVERS Yondu’s face.

Quill LOOKS INWARD. And suddenly, everything becomes...

QUIET.

Tears come to Peter Quill’s eyes as he remember those around 
him and what they mean to him.  And we see his MEMORIES.

- YOUNG PETER QUILL AND HIS MOTHER CUDDLED AND LISTENING TO 
MUSIC ON THE WALKMAN TOGETHER, EACH WITH ONE EAR PIECE.

- QUILL AND DRAX LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY ON THE MILANO.

- GAMORA AND PETER LOOKING INTO EACH OTHER’S EYES AND DANCING 
ON KNOWHERE.

- QUILL AND ROCKET FLYING THROUGH THE SKY ON AERO-RIGS FOR 
THE FIRST TIME, SMILING AS THE AIR RUSHES THROUGH THEIR HAIR. 
BABY GROOT CLUTCHES HAPPILY ONTO QUILL’S BACK.

- YONDU AND YOUNG QUILL IN THE FOREST. YONDU’S ARM IS ON 
PETER’S ARM AS HE TEACHES HIM HOW TO SHOOT.

Quill looks back up at Ego as we HEAR the gentle chords of 
FLEETWOOD MAC’S “THE CHAIN” starts echoing throughout the 
hollow. 

He clutches his fist and we see the light growing within it.

Bits of earth begin to ROLL UP AND SCRAMBLE AND SWIRL around 
Quill’s body, his arms, his legs, as if he’s pulling them 
towards himself with magnets. 

And Ego looks confused, as the GROUND QUAKES AROUND HIM.

Quill glares at his father, his voice distorting with 
Celestial thunder.

QUILL

You shouldn’t have killed my mom 
and squished my walkman.

Ahd a SOLID TORNADO OF EARTH PROPELS QUILL FORWARD.  Ego 
tries to protect himself as Quill SLAMS into him, FLYING 
UPWARDS WITH HIM --

Quill raises his fist, NOW A GIANT CLUB.  And he SMASHES Ego.

As Ego loses his concentration --

EXT. PLANET’S SURFACE - DAY

A pair of arms are protruding from the surface of the planet, 
still holding Mantis aloft. 

The earth falls away, and Drax, who was entirely covered, 
heaves for breath.

EXT. CRACK IN PLANET - DAY

The TENDRILS FALL, freeing Gamora and Nebula as they GASP.

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER - DAY

Yondu BREAKS THROUGH THE ROCKS around him, drawing in breath.

The TENTACLES HOLDING ROCKET ALOFT CRUMBLE, and he looks 
around, confused.

EARTH - EXT. ST. CHARLES, MISSOURI - DAY

The WAVE PUSHES UP against the back of Grandpa Quill’s CAMARO 
and suddenly STOPS: 

the mountainous plant, a hundred stories high, is up against

INT. SELF CHAMBER TUNNELS - DAY

The tunnel around Groot SNAPS BACK to what it was. Once more 
he can see the light at the tunnel’s end, and one looks like 
a GIANT BRAIN composed of prismatic light.

He RUNS forward.

INT. INSIDE BLAST HOLE - DAY

Rocket flies up and yells at Groot.

ROCKET

Groot! Groot, if you can can hear 
me, hurry up - I’m not sure how 
long Quill can keep him distracted!

INT. SELF CHAMBER CORE - DAY

Groot ARRIVES at the end of the tunnel, and stops there.  

The center of the core holds a huge cosmic placenta, and, 
within that, EGO’S TRUE SELF, the COSMIC BRAIN.  It ROILS 
FURIOUSLY, the reflection of its fight with Quill, thrashing 
around within this womb.  

Although afraid, Groot places the bomb on the placenta. 

Groot stares at both buttons, scared - he doesn’t know which 
one to pick.

Groot makes a decision on which button to press. He goes to 
push the death button. 

Then his finger STOPS just millimeters from the button, 
TREMBLING.  He thinks... 

And then changes the course of his finger, PUSHING THE 
CORRECT BUTTON. 

THE COUNTDOWN CLOCK COMMENCES. 

Baby Groot turns, terrified, and RUNS.

I/E. PLANET SURFACE/QUADRANT LOADING BAY - DAY

his face along the wall.

He TOSSES Quill into a another wall.

EXT. BELOW SELF CHAMBER/PLANET’S HOLLOW - DAY

QUILL brings his ARM FILLED WITH LIGHT away from the wall, so 
that he causes a WAVE OF LIGHT AND ROCK around the interior 
of the hollow, FLYING TO EGO and knocking him aside. 

Yondu protects his face as DIRT SWIRLS in the wake of the 
Quill/Ego battle.  

Rocket, carrying Groot, FLIES BACK DOWN beside him.

Rocket, hesitantly, nods.  He grabs some things from his bag.  
He hands them to Yondu.

ROCKET

A space suit and an aero rig. I 
only have one of each.

Yondu nods. Rocket nods too.

Ego SLAMS Quill back against a wall. Ego pulls the huge rocks

THERE.

Ego and Quill FLY TOWARDS each other.

Ego uses the LIGHT TO BRING ROCKS TO HIS BODY, forming a 
giant AVATAR OF HIMSELF.

Quill brings YELLOW ROCKS to his body, forming a GIANT PAC-

YONDU IS FLYING TOWARDS HIM ON AN AERO-RIG.  

Yondu GRABS him, almost a tackle, really, LIFTING HIM up and 
FLYING AWAY.

EXT. PLANET'S HOLLOW - DAY

As Yondu and Quill FLY UPWARD, the planet EXPLODES behind 
them, flames licking their heels, huge stretches of the 
planet caving in.

EXT. SKY - DAY

Yondu holds a surprised Quill as they SOAR up into the sky, 

YONDU

He may have been your father, boy.  
But he wasn’t your daddy.

QUILL

What?

YONDU

I’m sorry I didn’t do it right. I’m 
damn lucky you’re my boy.

Quill is touched.

Yondu SLAPS the SPACESUIT disk onto Quill; THE SHIMMERY 
SHEATHE COVERS HIM.

QUILL

What?

Yondu breathes out as completely as he can, emptying his 
lungs.  And they EXIT THE PLANET’S ATMOSPHERE, bursting into -

EXT. SPACE - OUTER SPACE

Quill struggles to get free, but Yondu holds him there, 
trapping him, but it is also an embrace. The ENTIRE PLANET is 
COLLAPSING BEHIND THEM.

QUILL

Yondu, you can’t!  What are you 
doing?  What are you doing?!

Yondu’s jet pack expires its supply of fuel, and they STOP 
THERE, in space, FLOATING.  

Yondu’s grip weakens. Quill turns to face him.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Yondu. Yondu, no!

Yondu grabs his son’s face with both hands, looking and 
touching him with love.  

QUILL (CONT’D)

No.

And Yondu’s FACE EXPANDS and his BODY GOES LIMP as he DIES
there.  And he starts to DRIFT AWAY.  Quill grabs onto his 
shirt. He is CRYING.

QUILL (CONT’D)

No!

And, suddenly, behind Quill, Rocket and Drax PROPEL 
themselves toward him in aero-rigs, GRABBING him.

FADE TO BLACK

INT. ECLECTOR CREMATORY - LATER

Yondu’s body lies on a plank here: Various colored cloths are 
laid in strips over his body and face, yaro lilies beneath 
him, red-fired pyres and Yondu’s toys all around.  

Rocket, Groot, Drax, Gamora, Mantis, and Kraglin surround the 
table.  Quill is at the head. He has to say a few words. But 
it is not easy.

QUILL

The other day I told Gamora how I 
used to pretend my dad was David 
Hasselhoff.  

Rocket and Drax exchange a look.

QUILL (CONT’D)

He’s a singer and actor from 
earth... a really famous guy.

Drax nods.

QUILL (CONT’D)

And, you know, today it struck me.  
Yondu didn’t have a talking car, 
but he did have a flying arrow.  
And he didn’t have the voice of an 
angel, but he did have the whistle 
of one.  And both David Hasselhoff
and Yondu went on kickass
adventures, and hooked up with hot 
women, and fought robots.

So, the thing is, David Hasselhoff
kinda did end up being my Dad after 
all, only he was Yondu.  I had a 
pretty cool Dad.

Quill starts to break down.

QUILL (CONT’D)

And what I’m trying to say here is, 
that thing you’re searching for 
your whole life, sometimes it’s 
right there by your side all along 
and you don’t even know it.

Gamora sees Nebula, watching from a darkened doorway, before 
she turns and walks away. She moves after her.

Groot looks up at an upset Rocket.

GROOT

I am Groot?

ROCKET

Yeah. That’s the friend I was 
talking about.

GROOT

I am Groot.

ROCKET

He did call you ‘twig.’

INT. QUADRANT SMALL HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

Gamora catches up to Nebula in the hall.

GAMORA

Nebula.

Nebula turns toward her, but she doesn’t look her in the eye.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

I was just a child. Like you. I was 
concerned with staying alive until 
the next day - every day. And I 
never considered what Thanos was 
doing to you.  I am sorry.

Nebula nods.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

I’m trying to make it right, 
everything I did. 

QUILL (CONT’D)

There are little girls like you 
were - little boys - all over the 
universe - who are in danger. You 
can stay with us, and help them.

NEBULA

I’ll help them by killing Thanos.

GAMORA

I don’t know if that’s possible.

Nebula shrugs: maybe.  She turns to leave. But Gamora grabs 
her, perhaps too roughly.  Nebula turns, ready to snap.

And Gamora EMBRACES her. Nebula does not know how to react.  

GAMORA (CONT’D)

You’ll always be my sister.

Tears well in Nebula’s eyes and, for just a moment, she 
embraces her sister back with one hand...

Before pushing her away and leaving.

INT. ECLECTOR CREMATORY - MOMENTS LATER

The Guardians lift Yondu on the plank.  A bulbous and rusty 
crematory is at the center of the room. It doesn’t burn with 
fire, but a SWIRLING, VIBRANT COSMIC ENERGY.

They SLIDE YONDU IN as they watch with sadness and respect as 
his body is enveloped by the sparkling colors.  Quill closes 
the door on the crematory. 

As Quill moves away, Kraglin approaches.  

KRAGLIN

Pete. 

Quill turns toward him. He’s holding something.

KRAGLIN (CONT’D)

Cap’n found this for you in a 
junker shop. Said someday you’d 
come back to the fold.

Kraglin puts an MP3 player in his hand.

KRAGLIN (CONT’D)

It’s called a Zune - what everyone 
listens to on earth nowadays. It’s 
got three hundred songs.

Quill nods, touched.

GAMORA (CONT’D)

132

© Marvel 


QUILL

Wait.

Quill holds out Yondu’s arrow.  Kraglin’s lip trembles.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Rocket grabbed the pieces and 
reassembled them. I think Yondu 
would want you to have it.

KRAGLIN

Thank you... Cap’n.

EXT. QUADRANT - OUTER SPACE

Yondu’s SPARKLING ASHES ARE BLOWN OUT IN SPURTS FROM THE 
CREMATORY INTO SPACE.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Rocket, Drax, and Mantis are here, watching Yondu’s ashes in 
the vacuum of space, SWIRLING almost magically. 

INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - OUTER SPACE

Quill sits down on the bed in Yondu’s quarters.  He scrolls 
through selections on the Zune.  

He comes to “FATHER AND SON” by CAT STEVENS. 

He PRESSES PLAY.

He listens.  As he does, Groot crawls up onto the bed, and 
then onto his lap. 

Quill offers him one of the ear buds.  

Groot holds it against his ear, amazed by the clarity of 
sound. Quill watches him, hearing the beauty of the song more 
through Groot’s face than the music itself.

And they sit there together, listening to the music, a new 
father and son.

INT. M-SHIP - OUTER SPACE

Nebula FLIES AWAY, sad, perhaps regretful, but forcing her 
chin up to brace against what’s to come. 

INT. QUADRANT SMALL HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE

Gamora watches, THROUGH A WINDOW, as Nebula leaves. 

133

© Marvel 


INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Rocket sees something by the ashes.  His eyes alight.

ROCKET

They came.

INT. CAPTAIN’S QUARTERS - OUTER SPACE

Groot sees COLORFUL FLASHING LIGHTS out of the window.  He 
pulls on Quill’s shirt to show him.  

They go to get a better view.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

Drax and Rocket see Yondu’s COSMIC ASHES PULSING AND SWIRLING
out in space as, one by one, enormous RAVAGER SHIPS arrive 
around them.  

They each FLASH SPECIFIC LIGHT SEQUENCES - and, with all the 
ships together - it looks like fireworks.

DRAX

What is it?

ROCKET

I sent word to Yondu’s old Ravager 
buddies and told them what he did.

Quill comes up behind them with Groot, just as Gamora enters.  
Quill smiles.

QUILL

It’s a Ravager funeral.

INT. HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE

Kraglin sees it from here. He SCREAMS with joy, and he slams 
his fist twice against his chest, a Ravager salute.

I/E. RAVAGER FLIGHT DECK 1 - OUTER SPACE

STAKAR and Martinex watch him there, moved.

MARTINEX

He didn’t let us down after all, 
Cap’n.

STAKAR

No, he did not, son. He did not.

134

I/E. RAVAGER FLIGHT DECK 2 - OUTER SPACE

CHARLIE-27, an enormous man, is wistful as he salutes.

CHARLIE-27

Fare thee well, old friend.

I/E. RAVAGER FLIGHT DECK 3 - OUTER SPACE

ALETA is here, tears in her eyes, alcohol in her hand, an ALL-
FEMALE RAVAGER CREW around her.

ALETA

See you in the stars, Yondu Udonta.

INT. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE

And the Guardians all watch, enchanted by the majesty. 

ROCKET

He didn’t chase ‘em away.

QUILL

No.

ROCKET

Even though he yelled at ‘em.

Quill shakes his head.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

And was always mean.

Quill shakes his head.

ROCKET (CONT’D)

And he stole batteries he didn’t 
need.

Quill is surprised - what? And then he looks at Rocket, a 
little animal who doesn’t know the rules of how to be any 
more than a young boy whose tribe sold him into slavery.

QUILL

Of course not.

Baby Groot is on Gamora’s shoulder.  He reaches for Drax, who 
takes him.  Baby Groot YAWNS and nuzzles into Drax’s 
shoulder, falling asleep. Drax lovingly pats his back.

Gamora looks at Drax and Groot, and Rocket, and Mantis, 
taking it all in, this strange family of hers.  She turns to 
Quill, staring at him with love.

135

© Marvel 


QUILL (CONT’D)

What?

GAMORA

It’s just some unspoken thing.

Quill wraps his arm around her and she sinks into him. 

Mantis smiles and becomes teary and GASPS, overwhelmed, as 
she looks out the window.  

MANTIS

It’s beautiful.

DRAX

It is.  And so are you.

(beat)

On the inside.

They turn back to the window and they stand there together, 
our Guardians of the Galaxy, watching the Ravager funeral and 
the colorful dust of an old friend dance.  

And the shape of the dust seems to form something very close 
to an ARROW.

Rocket sees this and he cries.

THE END (NOT REALLY)

RUN CREDITS.

“SURRENDER” BY CHEAP TRICK PLAYS.

CREDIT BREAK 1 - INT. ECLECTOR HALLWAY - OUTER SPACE

SURRENDER is PLAYING HERE.  Kraglin has had a version of 
Yondu’s fin implanted in his head.  He looks nervously down 
at the arrow on the floor.  

He tries to WHISTLE. It just flips around like a dead fish.

He WHISTLES again, and it FLIES UP, hitting a wall, and falls 
back down again.

He WHISTLES again, and it ZIPS AWAY.  We HEAR A SCREAM.

Kraglin looks around the corner where Drax is sitting, the 
ARROW IMPALED in his chest, yelling in agony.

Kraglin looks around, hoping no one saw him there, and he 
tries to slink away.

MORE CREDITS as SURRENDER CHORUS KICKS IN: Mommy’s all right, 
Daddy’s all right, they just seem a little weird.

END CREDITS - INT. STAKAR’S SHIP - OUTER SPACE

Stakar looks sad, serious.

STAKAR

It’s a shame it takes a tragedy 
like losing Yondu to bring us all 
back together. But I think he’d be 
proud if he knew we were working as 
a team again.

Over Stakar we see this incredibly motley crew - MARTINEX, 
CHARLIE-27, ALETA, who is holding MAINFRAME (a robotic head 
in a cage), and the mouthless, wormlike KRUGARR, 

STAKAR (CONT’D)

What say we steal some shit?

CHARLIE-27

In.

MARTINEX

Dope.

MAINFRAME

I MISSED you guys!

Krugarr makes a hex symbol and TWO COLORFUL THUMBS-UP BURST 
in front of him.

ALETA

Hell. Yes.

END CREDITS - INT. BIRTHING PODS CHAMBER - DAY

Ayesha sits on a bench, brooding, disheveled and still 
furious. The Chambermaid cautiously approaches. 

CHAMBERMAID

High Priestess, the Council is 
waiting.

AYESHA

They are perturbed I have wasted 
our resources.

The Chambermaid smiles politely, nods slightly, agreeing in a 
circumspect manner. Ayesha stares across the way.

137

© Marvel 


AYESHA (CONT’D)

When they see what I have created 
here, their wrath will dissipate, 
though it will be some time. 

The Chambermaid looks where Ayesha is looking.

CHAMBERMAID

That is not just another birthing 
pod, ma’am?

AYESHA

That, my child, is the next step in 
our evolution: more powerful, more 
beautiful, and more capable of 
destroying the Guardians of the 
Galaxy. 

A large, human-sized cocoon stands where Ayesha stares.

AYESHA (CONT’D)

I think I shall call him... ‘Adam’.

BOX OVER CREDITS - INT. GROOT’S BEDROOM - OUTER SPACE

Quill is standing in the bedroom doorway, looking down.

QUILL

Dude, seriously, you got to clean 
up your room. It’s a complete mess.

We REVEAL a gawky ADOLESCENT GROOT, hunched over, playing a 
video game, in this very messy room. 

ADOLESCENT GROOT

I am Groot.

QUILL

I’m not boring, man. You’re boring.
Once I got stuck on a planet where 
everyone was just lines and dots. I 
had to use geometry to get out of 
prison. Is that boring?

Adolescent Groot shakes his head in disdain.

QUILL (CONT’D)

You know what’s boring? Not doing 
the dishes. What’s boring is me 
tripping over your vines 
everywhere.

Adolescent Groot SIGHS.

138

QUILL (CONT’D)

Drax and I switched pants in the 
middle of that party last weekend. 
For no reason other than we’re 
awesome and very much not boring.

Quill starts to walk away then comes back.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Once I got a venereal disease that 
made me float for three days... 
Don’t tell Gamora... it’s dormant, 
but... If that’s boring then, I 
guess I’m boring. 

He looks at him.

QUILL (CONT’D)

I’m not boring.

Groot ROLLS HIS EYES and makes an exasperated sound.

QUILL (CONT’D)

What’s boring is when you roll your 
eyes like that at me and make an 
exasperated sound like I’m an old, 
boring, stupid idiot. 

Quill thinks.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Now I know how Yondu felt.

Quill begins to CRY.

QUILL (CONT’D)

Yondu.

CUT TO BLACK.

[Marvel Opening Credits]

[Radio transmission sound]

[The Marvel Studios Logo plays as usual but this time, at the end of that logo, the background changes from red to black and the I and O in "Studios" become 10 in red. The logo now reads "Marvel Studios". Throughout the logo, an Asgardian is reporting a distress signal.] Asgardian PA: This is the Asgardian refugee vessel Statesman. We are under assault, I repeat, we are under assault - The engines are dead, life support failing. Requesting aid from any vessel within range. We are 22 jump points out of Asgard. [The voice becomes more desperate and pleading] Our crew is made up of Asgardian families, we have very few soldiers here. This is not a warcraft. I repeat, this is not a warcraft! [The ship is being hit by missiles.]

[Inside the ship, Ebony Maw walks among the bodies of dead Asgardians. Heimdall, badly wounded, reaches out as if he would stop Maw as he passes, but lacks the strength. Maw steps over them with no mind as he speaks, as if they were scattered pieces of dirty clothing on a bedroom floor.]

Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan.... You may think this is suffering... no. It is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... [Corvus Glaive stabs one of the lingering Asgardians] for even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.

[Loki stands with the Black Order. He watches Thanos, shrouded in darkness and light, a vague silhouette.]

Thanos: [Looking out the large window we saw at the end of Thor: Ragnarok] I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless. [Lifts Thor by the neck of his breastplate. Thor struggles feebly.] It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I AM.

[Thanos holds up his hand to reveal the Infinity Gauntlet, which already hosts the violet Power Stone.]

Thor: [Now being held by Thanos with one huge hand wrapping around his head; blood drools from his mouth] You talk too much.

Thanos: [To Loki] The Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference.

[The Black Order heft their weapons or smirks, as appropriate.]

Loki: Oh, I do. Kill away!

[Thanos' face expresses surprise briefly before presses the gauntlet to Thor's left temple. The Power Stone glows brightly. Thor screams hoarsely.]

Loki: [Starts losing his cool demeanor almost immediately as Thor suffers, and breaks after only a few moments] ALL RIGHT, STOP!

Thor: We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.

[Loki glances at Thor like he knows something he doesn't. He lifts his right hand into the air and the Tesseract reveals itself.]

Thor: You really are the worst brother.

Loki: [While holding the Tesseract out to Thanos and advancing] I assure you, brother... the sun will shine on us again.

Thanos: Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.

Loki: Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another... we have a Hulk.

[Thanos looks to his right just as a green and very angry mass slams into him. Loki dives for Thor, pulling both of them out of the way as the Tesseract skitters across the floor, and the Hulk charges Thanos. The Hulk pummels Thanos, forcing him backwards and shoving him into the wall of the ship. Maw stops Cull Obsidian from interfering.]

Ebony Maw: Let him have his fun.

[Thanos pries the Hulk's hands away; an expression of surprise and fear crosses his green face. After several hard blows, Thanos picks up the Hulk and slams him to the deck, defeated. Thor slams a metal bar across Thanos' back to no avail, is kicked across the deck by Thanos and is promptly bound in metal debris by Ebony Maw to keep him from interfering further.]

Heimdall: [Prays] Allfathers… let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.

[Heimdall summons the Bifrost, which carries the Hulk away; he meets Thor's eye.]

Thanos: That was a mistake.

[Thanos borrows Corvus's glaive and stabs Heimdall through the heart, twisting the blade in the wound.]

Thor: NO!!! [After Thanos kills Heimdall] You're going to die for that!

Ebony Maw: [Shuts Thor's mouth with his telekinesis] Shh.

Ebony Maw: [Kneels before Thanos, offering up the Tesseract] My humble personage… bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp.

[Thanos crushes the Tesseract, revealing the blue Space Stone. He blows some of the fractals away, fingering the Stone between his thumb and index, before placing it on the gauntlet, and is momentarily rocked by the surge of energy that pulses as the stone seats in its setting.]

Thanos: There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.

Proxima Midnight: [Kneeling] Father, we will not fail you.

Cull Obsidian: We're going to New York City and We will tear The Avengers Apart and Smash! Once and for all, my lord.

Loki: [Emerging from behind the Black Order] [cheerfully] If I might interject… if you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena.

Thanos: [Unimpressed] If you consider failure experience.

Loki: I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos, I... Loki... Prince of Asgard... [looks significantly at Thor] Odinson... the rightful King of Jotunheim... God of Mischief... do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity.

[Thor squints and notices a dagger materialize in Loki's hand. Loki braces himself, thrusts upward with lightning speed and attempts to stab Thanos, but is frozen in place by the Space Stone's power before the point could strike home.]

Thanos: "Undying?" You should choose your words more carefully.

[Thanos twists the dagger out of Loki's hand with his right hand, then takes hold of Loki's neck with the gauntlet and lifts him to eye level. Loki struggles, kicking, as his throat is squeezed. He makes eye contact with Thor before he increases his force on Loki's neck.]

Loki: [Giving up on fighting against Thanos] You will... never be... a god. [Thanos crushes Loki's neck, killing him.]

Thor: [Muffled] NO!

Thanos: [Walks over and drops Loki's body in front of Thor.] No resurrections this time.

[Thanos raises the gauntlet, sends violet Power fire through the remains of the Statesman, and uses the Space Stone to teleport away with the Black Order.]

Thor: No… Loki….

[Thor is released from his bonds. He crawls over to Loki's body -- which, unlike in The Dark World, has not returned to its Jotun form -- and lays his head down on Loki's chest, shedding tears for all that he has lost. The ship explodes.]

[The Bifrost continues its journey, bringing the Hulk across space to Earth.]

[Sanctum Sanctorum, New York City]

[Doctor Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts, proceeds down the main steps of the Sanctum with Wong.]

Stephen Strange: [Dressed in casual American clothes.] Seriously? You don't have any money?

Wong: [Dressed as Wong is always dressed.] Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.

Stephen Strange: I'll tell the guys at the deli. [Wryly] Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.

Wong: Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have 200.

Stephen Strange: Dollars?

Wong: Rupees.

Stephen Strange: Which is?

Wong: Uh, buck and a half.

Stephen Strange: What do you want?

Wong: I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.

[Bruce crash-lands through the Sanctum stairs. The Cloak of Levitation swirls around Strange's shoulders immediately.]

Bruce Banner: Thanos is coming. He's coming...

Stephen Strange: [Sharing a look with Wong, and now fully in his mage attire] Who?

[Title Screen: Avengers: Infinity War]

[Public Park, New York City, day. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts walk on having a conversation.]

Tony Stark: Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding.

Pepper Potts: [Laughing slightly and talking over him] You're totally rambling.

Tony Stark: [Also talking over her] No, I'm not.

Pepper Potts: Lost me.

Tony Stark: Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?

Pepper Potts: Yeah.

Tony Stark: Okay, and then you're like, 'Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?', 'Oh! Someone's watching,' ''m gonna go in my pants.'

Pepper Potts: Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee.

Tony Stark: Yes.

Pepper Potts: Yeah. Everybody has that.

Tony Stark: Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?

Pepper Potts: [Nodding in understanding] Right.

Tony Stark: Morgan! Morgan.

Pepper Potts: So you woke up, and thought that we were...

Tony Stark: Expecting.

Pepper Potts: Yeah.

Tony Stark: [Becoming excited] Yes?

Pepper Potts: [Shaking her head] No.

Tony Stark: I had a dream about it. It was so real.

Pepper Potts: If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that.

[Pepper unties his jacket sleeves and taps Tony's chest attachment.]

Tony Stark: I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles.

Pepper Potts: It's not helping your case, OK?

Tony Stark: No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-

Pepper Potts: [Insistently] You don't need that.

Tony Stark: I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future uses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know...

Pepper Potts: Shirts?

Tony Stark: You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.

Pepper Potts: You should have shirts in your closet.

Tony Stark: Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.

Pepper Potts: Yes.

Tony Stark: I will. [Tony kisses Pepper.]

[Doctor Strange comes through a portal.]

Stephen Strange: Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.

[Tony and Pepper are understandably shocked.]

Tony Stark: I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?

Stephen Strange:We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.

Tony Stark: And who's "we"?

Bruce Banner: [Emerges from behind Doctor Strange] Hey, Tony.

Tony Stark: [Looking surprised] Bruce.

Bruce Banner: Pepper.

Pepper Potts: Hi.

Tony Stark: You okay?

[Bruce gives Tony a desperate hug, not answering. After everything he has been through, we understand.]

[Back at the Sanctum Sanctorum.]

Wong: [Using magic to show the universe and five out of six Infinity Stones.] From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence.

Stephen Strange: [Each Stone lights up as Dr. Strange names them.] Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.

[Dr. Strange opens the Eye of Agamotto, revealing the Time Stone emitting emerald light.]

Tony Stark: [Very attentive] Tell me his name again.

Bruce Banner: Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. That's him.

Tony Stark: [Speaking to himself] This is it... What's our timeline?

Bruce Banner: No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony...

Stephen Strange: He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.

Tony Stark: [Leans against a cauldron, stretching like he's about to go for a run.] Did you seriously just say "hitherto undreamt of"?

Stephen Strange: Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?

Tony Stark: Is that what this is.... ?

[The Cloak of Levitation smacks Tony's arm, surprising him.]

Tony Stark: [Looking offended] [Straightening himself] I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?

Stephen Strange: No can do.

Wong: We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.

Tony Stark: And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so....

Stephen Strange: Stark Raving Hazelnuts.

Tony Stark: It's not bad.

Stephen Strange: A bit chalky.

Wong: A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge is our favorite.

Bruce Banner: That's a thing?

Tony Stark: Whatever. Point is: things change.

Stephen Strange: Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.

Tony Stark: And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.

Stephen Strange: Well, if we don't do our jobs.

Tony Stark: [Slightly condescending] What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?

Stephen Strange: [Completely calm] Protecting your reality, douchebag.

[You seriously can't tell who's sarcasm is better.]

Bruce Banner: Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.

Tony Stark: [Awkwardly] Yeah, that's the... thing.

Bruce Banner: What do you mean?

Tony Stark: Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.

Bruce Banner: What? Tony, you lost another super bot?

Tony Stark: I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.

Stephen Strange: Who could find Vision, then?

Tony Stark: [Quietly to himself] Shit. [To the other men in a normal tone] Probably Steve Rogers.

Stephen Strange: [Sighing in exasperation] Oh, great.

Tony Stark: Maybe. But... [Sighs]

Bruce Banner: [Missing the events of the Avengers' Civil War] Call him.

Tony Stark: It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?

Bruce Banner: No.

Tony Stark: The Avengers broke up. We're toast.

Bruce Banner: [Rather surprised and slightly let-down] Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?

Tony Stark: Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.

Bruce Banner: [Almost pleading] Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.

[Tony hesitates, before pulling out the cellular phone Steve mailed him, muttering 'flip phone'. It seems as though he brings it everywhere, always ready to call his lost friend. Before clicking "Call", he pauses, distracted by an unusual rumbling.]

Tony Stark: Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?

Stephen Strange: [Looking up at his forelock fluttering] Not at the moment, no.

[Tony looks at the Hulk-made opening through the ceiling and sees debris flying by outside. He exits the Sanctum through the front door and scans the chaotic surroundings, the camera shaking around in this following long take to illustrate the chaos -- people running and screaming in alarm, traffic becoming impossibly tangled, a litter-filled wind like a nor'easter's. A woman falls nearly at his feet and he helps her up.]

Tony Stark: You okay?

[The woman ignores him and runs away. A car crashes in on a pole behind Tony.]

Tony Stark: Help him! Wong, Doc.

Bruce Banner: Go! Got it!

Tony Stark: [Putting on his sunglasses] F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?

F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Not sure, I'm working on it.

Tony Stark: Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!

Stephen Strange: [Bands of spells are readied around his forearms] Might wanna use it.

[A mechanical hum grows louder as Tony approaches the intersection. As he turns the corner, he sees a huge circular ship floating over Bleecker Street.]

[On a school bus, the hairs on Peter Parker's arms stand up. He looks out the window and sees the ship.]

Peter Parker: [Tapping his best friend in the seat in front of him] Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.

Ned Leeds: [Turns around and sees the spaceship] Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!

[Students scramble to the windows in the back to see the spaceship.]

[Peter quickly slides on one of his Stark-made webshooters, and webs the emergency exit lever on the opposite side of the bus.]

School Bus Driver, Stan Lee: What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?

[Peter jumps out the window, clinging to the side of the bus and pulling on his mask before leaping over the side of the bridge, shooting a web-line and swinging free. He makes his way hastily towards the ship.]

Tony Stark: F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.

F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Will do.

[Doctor Strange throws the Winds of Watoomb over Bleeker Street, and winks at Tony. The dust clears. Tony is begrudgingly amused for a split second.]

[Then Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian exit the ship by transmat.]

Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to...

Tony Stark: [Echoing the familiarly defiant 2008 Tony Stark] I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.

Ebony Maw: [Looks at Doctor Strange] Stonekeeper... [Gestures to Tony] Does this chattering animal speak for you?

Stephen Strange: Certainly not. I speak for myself. [Magical shields are readied with his fists, stepping forward.] But you’re trespassing in this city and on this planet. [Wong emulates him.]

Tony Stark: It means get lost, Squidward!

Ebony Maw: He exhausts me.

Cull Obsidian: [Two untranslated syllables]

Ebony Maw: Bring me the Stone.

Cull Obsidian: [Three untranslated syllables] [He drops his huge alien hammer and drags it along as he obeys his brethren.]

Tony Stark: Banner, you want a piece?

Bruce Banner: No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?

Tony Stark: That's right.

[Bruce attempts to release the Hulk. Instead of Hulk coming out easily, the most that turns green is Bruce's neck.]

Tony Stark: Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.

Bruce Banner: I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man.

Tony Stark: Where's your guy?

Bruce Banner: I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.

Tony Stark: There's no time for a thing.

Bruce Banner: I know.

Tony Stark: [Points at the approaching Obsidian] That's the thing right there. Let's go.

[Bruce gives out a loud grunt, but fails to release the Hulk. Doctor Strange stares at Tony and Bruce in disbelief.]

Tony Stark: [Glances at Doctor Strange] Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.

Bruce Banner: Tony, I'm sorry. [Stammers] Either I can't or he won't--

Tony Stark: It's okay. Hey, stand down. [to Wong] Keep an eye on him. Thank you.

Wong: I have him.

Bruce Banner: Damn it.

[As Cull Obsidian approaches the team, Tony dons his nanotech Iron Man suit in the space of three steps. He grows a shield on one arm to protect himself, then grows a set of blasters that easily throw the Dwarf back to Maw, who gestures and deflects his massive companion into some cars.]

Bruce Banner: Where'd that come from?

Tony Stark: It's nano-tech. You like it? A little someth--

[Ebony Maw creates a spike of earth that throws Iron Man far up, and attacks the rest of the team with uprooted trees and other debris. Wong summons the Shield of the Seraphim.]

Stephen Strange: Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us....

[Doctor Strange teleports Bruce to a nearby park along with half a taxi. Iron Man returns and joins the fight, pushing a car thrown by Maw back at him. Maw cuts it in half and lets the pieces fly past him, untouched.]

Tony Stark: Gotta get that stone outta here, now.

Stephen Strange: It stays with me.

Tony Stark: Exactly. Bye.

[Iron Man flies through Ebony Maw's obstacle course but is cut short by Cull Obsidian's hammer, sending him through a building and into the park at high speed, plowing into the ground and fetching up against a tree.]

Bruce Banner: [Rushing over to Iron Man] Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? Bad?

Tony Stark: Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?

Bruce Banner: I'm trying. He won't come out.

[Cull Obsidian arrives at the park and throws his hammer at Bruce and Iron Man.]

Tony Stark: Hammer. [Pushes Bruce out of the way.]

[Iron Man's energy beam deflects off Cull Obsidian's shield, slicing down trees. Bruce barely evades one.]

Bruce Banner: [Crawling out from under the branches. Desperate and confused] Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me? [Starts slapping himself multiple times] Come out! Come out! Come out!

Hulk: [Half of Bruce's face becomes the Hulk.] Nooooooo! [Bruce falls back exhausted into his tree.]

Bruce Banner: What do you mean, "no"?!

[Iron Man is knocked down by Obsidian, who is about to deliver a decisive blow, but the alien's hammer is easily caught by Spider-Man.]

Peter Parker: Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?

Tony Stark: Kid, where'd you come from?

Peter Parker: Field trip to MoMA.

[Cull Obsidian grabs Spider-Man and throws him away.]

Peter Parker: What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?

Tony Stark: He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.

[Wong and Doctor Strange fight Maw. Maw lifts several bricks from the ground and turns them into sharp points. He sends them towards Wong and Doctor Strange. The two make portals and boomerang them back towards Maw. Maw moves a car to protect himself, but one spike still hits his head, creating a cut. Angered, Maw uses a broken fire hydrant's water stream to knock Wong back several meters, rendering him unconscious.]

[Doctor Strange snaps a whip of magical energy to bind Maw's hands and yanks, but Maw flies forward with the pull and pins Doctor Strange upside-down against a building, using the bricks to trap the Sorcerer Supreme.]

Ebony Maw: Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.

[Maw tries to grab the amulet holding the Time Stone but jerks back when it burns his hand.]

Stephen Strange: It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.

Ebony Maw: [Vehemently] Then I'll take it off your corpse.

[Maw pulls Doctor Strange away from the building and throws him to the ground. Doctor Strange starts the gestures to use the Eye of Agamotto, but utility cables first pin Doctor Strange's arms, interrupting the spell and closing the Eye, while another cable winds around his torso, then tightens around his throat.]

Stephen Strange: You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome.

Ebony Maw: You'll only wish you were dead. [Doctor Strange falls unconscious and to the ground; Maw raises a portion of street pavement to use as a carrier, but the Cloak of Levitation works its master loose of the cable spiral and flies Doctor Strange away.] NO!

Tony Stark: [Still fighting Cull Obsidian, as Doctor Strange passes through the park.] Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.

Peter Parker: On it!

[Spider-Man chases Ebony Maw, floating speedily and upright on a small platform of burbling debris leaving a deep rut in the streets, who in turn chases the Cloak-driven Doctor Strange through Manhattan; Maw attacks him, throwing a Rocket Mortgage billboard at Spider-Man to be rid of him.]

Peter Parker: [Untangles himself] Not cool!

[Maw bends all the utility poles in the path of the fleeing Cloak, finally snagging the loyal garment and ripping it loose of its master. Spider-Man scoops up Doctor Strange before he hits the pavement, but before he can get away with the unconscious Doctor Strange, a cone of blue light starts pulling the mage inexorably upwards. Spider-Man grabs a light pole to anchor himself, but Maw uproots it, sending Doctor Strange, Cloak and teenager on their way to his ship.]

Peter Parker: Uhhh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!

Tony Stark: Hang on, kid. [Cull Obsidian's hammer doubles as a claw, pinning Iron Man to the ground and shorting his suit. As Obsidian jumps towards Iron Man, blades ready to end this fight, he is sent through a portal instead. The alien turns and leaps to return the same way, but Wong closes it rapidly -- only Obsidian's severed hand makes it back to the park. Bruce kicks the hand away with a noise of disgust.]

Tony Stark: [Iron Man shakes himself free of the Dwarf's weapon, now powerless.] Wong, you're invited to my wedding. [Iron Man begins to fly towards the large ship] Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y. [Iron Man's foot thrusters morph together into a single larger jet and increase his speed considerably.]

[Ebony Maw walks towards the controls of the ship, Doctor Strange's unconscious body floating face-down behind him, and prepares to leave Earth's atmosphere.]

Tony Stark: [Still in pursuit of the ship and his protege.] Unlock 17-A. [A pod launches from the upstate Avengers headquarters and curves up to the accelerating circular ship.] Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.

Peter Parker: But you said save the wizard! [Spider-Man, gasping from lack of oxygen, pulls off his mask] I can't breathe!

Tony Stark: You're too high up. You're running out of air.

Peter Parker: Yeah! That makes sense.

[Peter passes out, free-falling, but not for long before the pod reaches him. It attaches itself to him, becoming the Iron Spider suit. Now being able to breathe, Spider-Man lands on a bottom part of the ship, standing up heroically.]

Peter Parker: Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!

Tony Stark: Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.

F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Yep.

[A large parachute extends from the new suit, snatching Spider-Man free of the ship's hull and him spiraling back to Earth.]

Peter Parker: OH, COME ON!

[Iron Man latches onto the hull and cuts a hole to board the ship, looking for wherever Strange and Ebony Maw went.]

F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.

Pepper Potts: [Sounding heavily worried] Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?

Tony Stark: Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.

Pepper Potts: Why?

Tony Stark: [While looking at the ship around him] Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.

Pepper Potts: Tell me you're not on that ship.

Tony Stark: Yeah.

Pepper Potts: God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship.

Tony Stark: Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.

Pepper Potts: Come back here, Tony. I swear to God….

Tony Stark: Pep….

Pepper Potts: Come back here right now! Come back!

F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too….

[Spider-Man is revealed to have managed to shoot a web to the outside of the ship, foiling his parachute, and clambers inside a slowly-closing chamber.]

Peter Parker: Oh my God! [Looks at the rapidly-receding planet behind him] I should have stayed on the bus....

[Ebony Maw, hands engaged in the ship's steering mechanism, accelerates into hyperspace.]

[Meanwhile, back in New York]

[Bruce finds Tony's flip-phone in the debris on the street and picks it up thoughtfully. Wong opens up a portal back to the Sanctum.]

Bruce Banner: Where you going?

Wong: The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?

Bruce Banner: [Holding Rogers' cell phone] I'm gonna make a call.

[Wong nods in understanding and closes the portal, not to be seen again for the rest of the movie. Banner holds Steve Rogers' cell phone and makes a call.]

[Screen title: SPACE]

[Camera pans around a brightly colored planet with ice rings to the Benatar. The Guardians of the Galaxy are travelling to investigate a distress call to the tune of "Rubberband Man".]

Peter Quill: [Chair-dancing to the song] Sing it, Drax!

[Drax is snoring with his mouth open from his seat in front of Quill. Gamora lip-syncs with the song along with Quill.]

Rocket: [Yawns] Why are we doing this again?

Gamora: [Annoyed] It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.

Rocket: I get that, but why are we doing it?

Peter Quill: 'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese [Quill rubs his thumb against his other fingers] for our help.

Gamora: [Waves her index finger at Quill] Which isn't the point.

Peter Quill: [Points back at Gamora] Which isn't the point... I mean… if he doesn't pony up….

Drax: We'll take his ship.

Rocket: Exactly!

Peter Quill: B-b-b-bingo!

[Gamora looks up at Quill in concern. Quill returns her look and grimaces a "don't worry about it" expression at her.]

Mantis: [Reading her console] We are arriving.

Peter Quill: All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces. [Groot rolls his eyes as Mantis makes a snarl. Groot's handheld Terran-vintage video game beeps.] Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again. [Game continues beeping] Groot.

Groot: [In a mocking tone] I am Groot! (Translation: Shut up, bitch!)

Peter Quill: Whoa!

Rocket: Language!

Gamora: Hey!

Drax: Wow.

Peter Quill: You got some acorns on you, kid.

Rocket: Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna SMASH THAT THING TO PIECES!

[Groot rolls his eyes.]

[The Benatar decelerates, and Thanos' devastation suddenly covers the Guardians' field of view, revealing the distress signal to be the one from the Asgardian vessel at the beginning of the movie. Bodies are seen floating dead in space along with the pieces of the shredded ship.]

Mantis: What happened?

Rocket: Looks like we're not getting paid.

[With a thump, Thor's body is plastered to the hull of the ship.]

Rocket: [Waving his hands] Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!

[Thor’s eye opens; all gasp.]

[Cut to the Guardians settling the still-unconscious Thor onto an examination table.]

Peter Quill: How the hell is this dude still alive?

Drax: [Sounding awed] He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... this is a man. A handsome, muscular man.

Peter Quill: [A little dented] I'm muscular.

Rocket: Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.

Peter Quill: Yeah, right.

Drax: It's true. You have gained a little weight…. [Drax motions to his chin and belly.]

[Gamora leaves Quill's side at Thor's right, and circles around the foot of the table.]

Peter Quill: What? Gamora, do you think I'm…

Mantis: He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.

Drax: It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.

Peter Quill: Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bow-flex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.

Rocket: You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?

Gamora: [Reaches Drax's side and picks up Thor's left arm, stroking his triceps] It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.

Peter Quill: [Snidely to Gamora] Stop massaging his muscles. [Gamora, annoyed, drops the arm with a thump; quietly to Mantis] Wake him up.

Mantis: [Places hand on Thor's forehead] Wake.

[Thor awakens, sitting up violently and throwing himself off the table to stumble a few steps away, then turning to see his hosts all pointing their weapons of choice at him; Groot is still playing his game.]

Thor: Who the hell are you guys?

[Cut to later as the Guardians stand around Thor eating soup.]

Gamora: The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre....

Drax: Including my own.

Gamora: If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this. [She snaps her fingers.]

Thor: You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.

Drax: Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.

Thor: Your father killed my brother. [Thor stands and strides towards Gamora aggressively.]

Peter Quill: Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do. [Thor softens a bit.]

Thor: Families can be tough. [He claps a hand on Gamora's shoulder] Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister... that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain.

[Peter glares at Thor's hand on Gamora's shoulder, on the verge of full snarl, and moves around her to push between her and Thor.]

Peter Quill: And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes--

Thor: [Not paying attention as he stares at his soup spoon] I need a hammer, not a spoon…. (He attempts to fiddle with machinery) How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe… maybe a birth date or something….

Peter Quill: What are you doing?

Thor: Taking your pod.

Peter Quill: [Clears his throat then deepens his voice] No, you're not! [Mimics Thor’s accent] You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir.

Rocket: Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?

Peter Quill: No.

Drax: You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.

Peter Quill: No I'm not.

Mantis: [Gasp] He just did it again!

Peter Quill: This is my voice!

Thor: [Steps closer to Quill] Are you mocking me?

Peter Quill: Are you mocking me?

Thor: Stop it. You did it again.

Peter Quill: He's trying to copy me.

Thor: Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.

Gamora: Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.

Thor: Knowhere.

Mantis: He must be going somewhere.

Peter Quill: [Voice now normal] No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food. [To Thor as he rummages through their food stores.]

Thor: Not anymore.

Gamora: Thor… why would he go to Knowhere?

Thor: Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.

Peter Quill: If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.

Thor: Or a genius.

Gamora: [To Thor] How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?

Thor: There's six stones out there. [Finishes rummaging and steps in front of Gamora] Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.

Peter Quill: The 'Avengers'?

Thor: [By way of explanation.] Earth's Mightiest Heroes.

Mantis: Like Kevin Bacon?

Thor: [Pause] He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.

Gamora: Then we have to go to Knowhere now.

Thor: Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.

Drax: That's a made up word.

Thor: All words are made up.

[It's official: mind blown.]

Rocket: Hold up, Nidavellir is real? [Climbing on to the table] Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. [Increasingly gleeful] They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.

Thor: The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.

Rocket: Rabbit?

Thor: Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need. [To Rocket] I assume you're the captain, sir?

Rocket: You're very perceptive.

Thor: You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?

Rocket: Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.

Thor: Wonderful.

Peter Quill: Except for that I'm the captain.

Thor: Quiet!

Peter Quill: That's my backpack.

Rocket: Go sit down.

Peter Quill: [To Thor] Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to… [gropes for "Nidavellir"] Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?

Thor: The Thanos killing kind.

Peter Quill: Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?

Thor: No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.

Rocket: Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?

Thor: A little bit. Yeah.

Gamora: If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.

Thor: He already is.

Rocket: I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.

Thor: So cool. [Smiles a big grin.]

Peter Quill: [To Rocket] For the record… I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.

Rocket: You know, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill. [As he enters the pod] Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain.

Thor: I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.

[The Guardians nod or wave farewell as Thor, Rocket and Groot depart. Cut to Scotland, where Vision and Wanda Maximoff are sharing a room. Wanda is in bed while Vision, in a human glamour, watches out a window.]

[High-pitched trilling]

Vision: [Gasps and holds his hand to the Mind Stone in pain.]

Wanda Maximoff: Vis? Is it the stone again?

Vision: It's as if it's speaking to me.

Wanda Maximoff: What does it say?

Vision: I don't... I don't know. But something... 

[The stone trills again and Vision flinches. Wanda takes his face in her hands. Vision turns his head so he can kiss her left palm, then presses Wanda's hand to the Mind Stone.]

Vision: Tell me what you feel.

[Wanda gestures, her hand emanating her red swirling energy. She seems confused.]

Wanda Maximoff: I just feel you.

[They kiss. Cut to later, where the two are going on a stroll.]

 Wanda Maximoff: So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.

Vision: What if I miss that train?

Wanda Maximoff: There is an 11.

Vision: What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?

Wanda Maximoff: You gave Stark your word.

Vision: I'd rather give it to you.

Wanda Maximoff: There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.

Vision: Not to each other. [He puts his hands on her shoulders] Wanda… for two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know. [Stammers] You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself -- I, I... I think...

Wanda Maximoff: It works.

Vision: It works.

Vision: Then stay. Stay with me.

[Wanda looks down, but then her eyes and attention drift to her left.]

Vision: [Suddenly very uncertain] Or not. If I'm overstepping…

[Wanda steps over to a better view of the TV in the kebab shop at which they had stopped, drawing Vision with her. It shows coverage of the invasion of New York, the alien antagonists, and the disappearance of Tony Stark.]

Wanda Maximoff: [Fearful] What are they?

Vision: What the stone was warning me about. [He kisses her hand] I have to go.

Wanda Maximoff: No, Vision. Vision, if that's true… then maybe going isn't the best idea.

Vision: Wanda, I… [Corvus Glaive appears suddenly behind Vision, stabbing him through the back. Vision screams, loses his glamour to return to his green, red and gold appearance, and is thrown down into the street.]

Wanda Maximoff: Vision! [She circles her hands, gathering up energy for a counterattack when Proxima Midnight blasts her from behind, knocking the Scarlet Witch across the street and through a bistro's window.]

[Corvus Glaive pins Vision down and digs the point of his high-tech glaive into Vision's forehead in an attempt to extract the Mind Stone.]

[The Scarlet Witch commits her own surprise attack, blasts both of the aliens away, then lifts Vision and herself into a nearby courtyard, from where the Scarlet Witch drags him to rest in a concealed alleyway.]

Vision: The blade. It stopped me from phasing.

Wanda Maximoff: Is that even possible?

Vision: It isn't supposed to be. [His voice distorts electronically] My systems are failing. [The Scarlet Witch gestures over his gaping wound, using her magic to knit him back together. Vision continues in a gasping, wry tone] I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.

[Corvus Glaive suddenly arrives, knocking the Scarlet aside and grabbing Vision into the air,]

Wanda Maximoff: Vis!

[Corvus flies away with Vision, slamming him against several walls. Meanwhile, Proxima engages the Scarlet Witch with her staff weapon and they too begin to fight.]

Corvus Glaive: [To Vision] Give up the Stone, and she lives.

[Vision flies with Corvus to the roof of what appears to be a church, ricocheting off the stone church tower and onto the metal-clad roof.]

[Simultaneously, Proxima and the Scarlet Witch fight below, staff weapon versus magic energy hands until Proxima uses the blaster effect of her weapon to knock the Scarlet Witch meters away, stunning her as Proxima leaps down, brandishing her weapon within bare inches of the Scarlet Witch's face, only held back by the Scarlet Witch's powers]

[Furiously, Vision pummels Corvus, then throws him across the roof, firing a beam from the Mind Stone. Corvus uses his glaive to deflect the beam, splitting it into several beams, cutting up Edinburgh's ancient stone like butter, until one branch finally reflects back at Vision, slamming him into the wall behind him.]

[Down below, the Scarlet Witch has blocked Proxima's staff once again when she hears an agonized cry from Vision. Desperation strengthens her to throw Proxima through the burning lorry sliced in half by the split Stone beam, stunning the alien. The Scarlet Witch then flies up to the roof where Glaive has pinned Vision and is again attempting to remove the Mind Stone.]

Wanda Maximoff: Hands off.

[The Scarlet Witch casts a bolt of magic which throws Corvus back through the wall and down a shaft, then flies the two of them away again. Proxima, who has recovered, shoots a bolt from her weapon, causing them to fall from the air and down through the roof of Edinburgh Waverley Train Station. Wanda crawls over to Vision, who cannot muster the strength to stand.]

Wanda Maximoff: [Hushed voice, pleading.] Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.

Vision: Please. Please leave.

Wanda Maximoff: You asked me to stay.... I'm staying.

Vision: Please.

Wanda Maximoff: Get up.

[Behind them, Proxima and Corvus crash through the roof and advance on them, brandishing their weapons. the Scarlet Witch moves protectively in front of Vision, building power in her hands.]

[An express train passes behind Wanda, and Proxima cocks her head as if aware of another's presence. Confused, the Scarlet Witch also turns and looks over her left shoulder. As the last train car passes, we see a silhouette on the far side of the platform. Proxima throws her weapon at the shadowy figure, but it is deftly caught just before the figure steps from the shadows.]

[As the Avengers theme kicks in, we now recognize a bearded and furious Steve Rogers (Captain America) as he steps into the light. Vision and the Scarlet Witch look hopeful and relieved. While all parties are distracted, Sam Wilson (Falcon) swoops in and kicks Proxima across the platform and through the closed cafe's security gate and furniture. Swooping around, he fires on Corvus.]

[At the same time, Captain America throws Proxima's weapon to Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) who engages Corvus, ducking under his swing, stabbing him in the gut and executing a flying kick to knock him backwards.]

[Proxima, who has rushed back to the fight, summons her weapon back to her hand and attacks Black Widow. Captain America leaps forward, rolls, scoops up Corvus's dropped glaive and holds her off. Black Widow joins in with her own escrima sticks. While the three are fighting, Falcon returns and again kicks Proxima backwards; she scuttles over to the prone Corvus. Falcon draws both of his Steyr SPP submachine pistols on the couple.]

Proxima Midnight: [To Glaive] Get up.

Corvus Glaive: I can't.

Natasha Romanoff: [Coolly] We don't wanna kill you. But we will.

Proxima Midnight: You'll never get the chance again.

[Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive depart as they are beamed up. The glaive is snatched from Captain America's hand as well.]

Sam Wilson: [To Vision] Can you stand?

Vision: [Electricity shimmers over his surface, and his voice distorts] Thank you, Captain.

Steve Rogers: [Nods] Let's get you on the jet.

Natasha Romanoff: [Closing the doors to the Quinjet, while addressing Wanda] I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances.

Wanda Maximoff: I'm sorry. We just wanted time.

Sam Wilson: Where to, Cap?

Steve Rogers: Home.

[Cut to the past, at Gamora's home planet Zen-Whoberi during Thanos' massacre. Gamora and her mother are hiding; the sounds of guns and screaming are outside.] 

Gamora's Mother: [To Young Gamora] Shh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.

[An explosion goes off close by and Gamora screeches by reflex, revealing their hiding spot.]

Child of Thanos: [Untranslated inquiry.]

[The door is smashed open and both Zehobereians scream.]

[Outside, it is utter chaos. Leviathans, Chitauri chariots and ring-ships fly overhead; explosions and energy bolts from numerous sources criss-cross the panicked population, felling them randomly; smoke arises from countless fires.]

Ebony Maw:  Zehobereians…

Young Gamora: [Being dragged by one arm through the crowds] Mother! Where's my mother?!

Ebony Maw: Zen-Whoberis... Choose a side, or die.

Young Gamora: Mother! [She punches at the arm of the one dragging her who surprisingly drops her arm and leaves.]

Ebony Maw: One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few.

[Gamora turns and finds herself facing Thanos in his full Titan armor.]

Thanos: What's wrong, little one?

Young Gamora: My mother. Where is my mother?

Thanos: [Kneels down to Gamora] What's your name?

Young Gamora: Gamora.

Thanos: You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you. [Thanos offers his hand; she wraps her little fingers around one massive finger, and he leads her to a pavilion, where he crouches to her eye level again and produces a small -- for him -- red-jeweled handle. Pressing the switch, razor-sharp blades pop out both ends.] Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other… [He balances it on one finger, overbalances it purposefully and catches it.] Here. You try.

[Thanos hands Gamora the dagger -- the handle is two child-palms' widths in length. She tries balancing it on her index finger.]

Ebony Maw: Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.

[One half of the crowd is shot down. The survivors scream in horror, and Gamora tries to turn but Thanos prevents her from seeing the massacre.]

Thanos: Concentrate. There! You've got it.

[Cut to the present, aboard the GUARDIANS’ ship. Gamora is brooding, activates the spring-action blades on the same dagger.]

Peter Quill: Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the "blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to--

Gamora: I need to ask a favor.

Peter Quill: Yeah, sure.

Gamora: One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.

Peter Quill: Which is what the grenades are for. [Gamora silences him with a look.] I'm sorry. What's the favor?

Gamora: If things go wrong… If Thanos gets me… I want you to promise me… you'll kill me.

Peter Quill: [A beat. Confusion.] What?

Gamora: I know something he doesn't. If he finds out… the entire Universe could be at risk.

Peter Quill:  What do you know?

Gamora: If I tell you, you'd know, too.

Peter Quill: If it's so important, shouldn't I?

Gamora: Only if you wanna die.

Peter Quill: Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?

Gamora: Just… trust me. And possibly, kill me.

Peter Quill: I mean, I'd like to. I really would… [Gamora silences him by covering his mouth with her hand.]

Gamora: Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.

Peter Quill: [A beat. One that rests with him significantly.] Okay.

[The two kiss, until an odd crunching sound startles them. Drax is standing in the corner.]

Peter Quill: Dude. How long have you been standing there?

Drax: An hour.

Peter Quill: An hour? Are you serious?

Drax: I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye... watch.

[Drax stands motionless, then very slowly raises his hand towards his mouth]

Peter Quill: You're eating a zarg-nut.

Drax: But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.

Peter Quill: Mmm, no. [Quill and Gamora shake their heads.]

Drax: I'm sure I'm invisible.

Mantis: Hi, Drax.

Drax: [Knowing when he is beat] Damn it.

[The Benatar flies towards a massive skull and flies through one eye-hole into a vast interior cavern. Screen title: KNOWHERE.]

Peter Quill: This place looks deserted.

Drax: I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.

Peter Quill: Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here.

[The four Guardians disembark and sneak into the Collector’s collection room, which is in ruins. Thanos is threatening the Collector while the Guardians hide behind rubble.]

Collector: I don't have it.

Thanos: Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.

[Quill stops, and holds up a fist meaning 'halt' in the silent language of soldiers. Everybody walks quietly past him.]

Thanos: I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering. [Thanos places a heavy boot on the middle of the Collector's chest and presses.]

Collector: [Strained] I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?

Thanos: I imagine it's like breathing for you.

Collector: Like suicide.

Thanos: So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.

Collector: I didn't know what it was.

Thanos: Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?

Drax: Today...

Peter Quill: [Grasping the danger] Drax. Drax.

Drax: ...He pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.

Peter Quill: Drax, waaaaait! [Drax draws his long dagger from his leg scabbard.] Not yet, not yet, not yet. [Drax gives him a look and heads towards Thanos. Quill hurries as quietly as possible to catch up.] Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.

Drax: No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.

[Quill starts to struggle with Drax when Mantis puts her hand on the back of Drax's head.]

Mantis: Sleeeep. [Drax is knocked out, his falling body causing a loud crash. Everybody ducks.]

[Thanos looks towards the sound, then picks up the Collector and throws him into a collecting case before walking towards the disturbance.]

Peter Quill: Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm... [Gamora moves towards Thanos] The other right!

[Gamora leaps on Thanos from a stack of boxes, swinging her sword at him. He snaps the sword-blade in half, and Gamora stabs him in the throat with the stub, his lower jaw sagging and himself letting out a hoarse groan, then he is stabbed in the chest with the red-jeweled dagger.]

Thanos: Why? [He falls down] Why you? Daughter… [He holds his hand out to her, blood pooling out from his neck wound, before collapsing completely. Gamora breaks down, sobbing.]

Peter Quill: [Surprised] That was quick.

Collector: Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!

[Suddenly, Thanos' disembodied voice fills the room.]

Thanos: Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing.

[The scene disappears -- everything in the room is destroyed and/or on fire, the Collector waving bye-bye as he and his case vanish.]

Thanos: That is, it was. Now… reality can be whatever I want.

[Thanos is quite alive and undamaged. He has the red Reality Stone seated in the Infinity Gauntlet.]

Gamora: [Her face still wet, but no longer crying] You knew I'd come.

Thanos: I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one.

[Gamora hesitates for a beat, then reaches for her broken sword. Thanos grabs her by the back of the neck and swings her around in front of him.]

Drax: Thanos!

[With a pulse of the Reality Stone, both Drax and Mantis are 'disassembled' -- Drax is turned into a stack of tumbling cubes, and Mantis becomes a ribbon version of herself.]

Peter Quill: [Moving in, his blaster pointed right at Thanos] Let her go, Grimace!

Gamora: Peter…

Peter Quill: [To Gamora] I told you to go right.

Gamora: Now? Really?

Peter Quill: You let her go!

Thanos: Ah, the boyfriend.

Peter Quill: I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.

Gamora: Peter…

Peter Quill: Or I'm gonna blow that nut sack of a chin right off your face!

Gamora: Not him.

[Quill hesitates. He does not shoot anyone.]

Gamora: You promised! You promised.

Thanos: Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him. [to Quill] She's asked, hasn't she? Do it. [There is a very tense and unpleasant pause. Thanos rolls his head and shoves Gamora towards Quill’s gun, egging him on.] DO IT!!

Peter Quill: [Tearing up] I told you to go right.

Gamora: I love you, more than anything.

Peter Quill: I love you, too.

[Quill screws up his eyes and pulls the trigger -- but a stream of bubbles comes out. Thanos was playing him.]

Thanos: [Genuinely sincere] I like you.

[Thanos teleports Gamora and himself away as a stunned Quill picks up Gamora's sword, and his friends painfully re-assemble themselves, the Reality Stone's effects now subsiding in its absence.]

(Back on Earth, the Quinjet arrives at the upstate New York Avengers HQ while Col. James "Rhodey" Rhodes deals with the red tape in the holographic person of Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (Lt. Gen., USA Ret.).)

Secretary Ross: Still no word from Vision?

James Rhodes: Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.

Secretary Ross: On a stolen Quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.

James Rhodes: You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?

Secretary Ross: My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own.

James Rhodes: If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.

Secretary Ross: I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.

James Rhodes: [Sounding a little bitter] That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that. [We get a good look at his leg braces]

Secretary Ross: You have second thoughts?

James Rhodes: Not anymore.

[The fugitive Avengers enter the room, Vision supported by Sam.]

Steve Rogers: Mr. Secretary.

Secretary Ross: You got some nerve. I'll give you that.

Natasha Romanoff: You could use some of that right now.

Secretary Ross: The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?

Steve Rogers: I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight. [Steve takes a step forward, looking right at Ross] And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.

Secretary Ross: [To Rhodes] Arrest them.

James Rhodes: All over it. [Swipes off hologram; the computer beeps twice] That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.

Steve Rogers: [Hugging Rhodes] You too, Rhodey. [Natasha gets her own embrace.]

James Rhodes: Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.

Sam Wilson: Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.

Bruce Banner: Uh, I think you look great. [Rhodes and Natasha long round to see Bruce walking in from the opposite end of the room.] Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.

Natasha Romanoff: Hi, Bruce.

Bruce Banner: Nat.

Sam Wilson: [Whispering] This is awkward.

[Cut to a shot of Natasha, Bruce, Steve, Rhodey, Wanda, and Vision in another room.]

James Rhodes: So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?

Wanda Maximoff: And they can clearly find us.

Bruce Banner: We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?

Natasha Romanoff: After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest.

Bruce Banner: Who's Scott?

Steve Rogers: Ant-Man.

Bruce Banner: There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look… Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone.

Natasha Romanoff: Well then, we have to protect it.

Vision: No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps… its molecular integrity could fail. [Vision addresses Wanda as he nears her.]

Wanda Maximoff: And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.

Vision: Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.

Wanda Maximoff: That's too high a price.

Vision: [Takes her face gently in both hands] Only you have the power to pay it. [Wanda walks away, distressed] Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.

Steve Rogers: [Eyes diverted down] But it should. [Looks up at Vision] We don't trade lives, Vision.

Vision: [Walking toward Steve] Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?

[Steve takes a breath, but before he has a chance to answer, Bruce speaks.]

Bruce Banner: Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.

Wanda Maximoff: You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?

Bruce Banner: I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.

Natasha Romanoff: Can we do that?

Bruce Banner: Not me. Not here.

James Rhodes: You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.

Steve Rogers: I know somewhere.

[Cut to rural Wakanda, as King T'Challa and Okoye walk together, accompanied by two Kingsguard. Screen title: WAKANDA.]

Okoye: You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.

T'Challa: And the Border Tribe?

Okoye: Those that are left.

T'Challa: Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.

Okoye: And what of this one?

T'Challa: This one may be tired of war. [James "Bucky" Buchanan Barnes is seen at a small distance throwing a bag from a pile on the ground onto a partly-filled cart, while two village children watch] But the White Wolf has rested long enough.

[The party reaches Bucky. A Kingsguards-man sets an elaborate and high-tech-looking equipment case down on the cart, opens the lid, and steps back. As the Winter Soldier approaches, he sees a new Vibranium arm in the case.]

Bucky Barnes: [With resignation] Where's the fight?

T'Challa: On its way.

[Cut to Ebony Maw interrogating Dr. Strange. Dr. Strange is floating horizontally, face down, and is surrounded by dozens of glassy needles, each about two feet long.]

Ebony Maw: In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be... judgement. [The needles start to contact Dr. Strange's face, causing an obviously painful whitish subcutaneous glow at each touch] Give me... the stone.

[Cut to Tony who is watching, hidden, from above. The Cloak of Levitation taps Stark on the arm. He raises his hand to it, ready to shoot, but he sees what it is and stands down.]

Tony Stark: Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?

Peter Parker: Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty....

[Tony and the Cloak turn to face Peter, dropping down from above]

Tony Stark: What the--

Peter Parker: I know what you're gonna say.

Tony Stark: You should not be here.

[The Cloak moves to "stand" at Tony's side]

Peter Parker: I was gonna go home--

Tony Stark: I don't wanna hear it.

Peter Parker: But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...

Tony Stark: And now I gotta hear it.

[The Cloak shakes its collar in sympathy and shrugs]

Peter Parker: ...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.

[The Cloak looks shocked.]

Tony Stark: [Seriously] What did you just say?

Peter Parker: I take that back. And now I'm here in space.

Tony Stark: Yeah. [Tony crosses to stand right in front of Peter] Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's a one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.

Peter Parker: No. I did think this through.

Tony Stark: You could not have possibly thought this through.

Peter Parker: It's just .. you can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood. [He waits for Tony's reaction] Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.

Tony Stark: [Breaths shakily] Come on. We got a situation. [He leads Peter over to a viewpoint on the torture below. Peter crouches to study the situation, the Cloak leaning over his shoulder.] See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.

Peter Parker: Um. Okay, okay... uh... [Peter and the Cloak pop back upright] Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?

[The Cloak lifts its collar in surprise.]

[Cut back to Ebony Maw interrogating Dr. Strange, who groans loudly.]

Ebony Maw: Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...

[At the "thump" behind him, Maw turns to see Iron Man standing there, hand repulsors ready to fire.]

Ebony Maw: ...Could end your friend's life in an instant.

Tony Stark: I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.

Ebony Maw: [Walks slowly towards Iron Man, beckoning very large, very solid metal objects to float behind him] You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.

Tony Stark: Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.

[Iron Man fires a rocket from his shoulder which pierces the side of the ship to Maw's right and begins to suck everything out with depressurization, especially Maw and his large objects. Dr. Strange is pulled loose of his pinnings, loses the needles, but also heads for the hole, helpless to resist. The Cape wraps around his arm and an anchor point, but Dr. Strange's arm slips loose and he keeps going. Spider-Man shoots a web strand at Dr. Strange with one hand and holds onto a piece of the ship with the other. It breaks, sending them both towards space when his Iron-Spider suit's metal arms brace him to keep him from being sucked out. Fortunately, Dr. Strange is still surrounded by the ship's atmosphere making haste to leave.]

Peter Parker: Yes! Wait what are those?!

[Spider-Man crouches with his new spider-legs, and makes a mighty leap to pulls them both back inside. Iron Man quickly sprays nanites onto the hole to plug it up. Dr. Strange safely, if emphatically, hits the floor. Ebony Maw is seen floating in space, quite dead, ice from the escaped atmosphere frosting over his grimace. Spider-Man lands on his new legs, retracts them, and finds the Cape "standing" next to him.]

Peter Parker: Hey, we haven't officially met. [He offers the Cape his hand to shake. It ignores his offer and continues to Dr. Strange.] Cool.

[Iron Man walks past Dr. Strange, shaking his head and with his armor retreating into its containment as Dr. Strange gets to his feet and becomes en-Cloaked.]

Stephen Strange: We've gotta turn this ship around.

Tony Stark: Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.

Stephen Strange: No, I want to protect the stone.

[Tony walks towards the expansive front view-port, showing a hyper speed/warp effect.]

Tony Stark: [Irritably] And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.

Stephen Strange: For what? Nearly blasting me into space?

Tony Stark: Who just saved your magical ass? Me.

Stephen Strange: I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.

Tony Stark: Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.

Stephen Strange: Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.

Tony Stark: And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.

[Seriously, these two's egos are a recipe for disaster.]

Peter Parker: [Raises his hand] I'm backup.

Tony Stark: No. You're a stowaway. [Waggles a finger between himself and Dr. Strange] The adults are talking.

Stephen Strange: I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-- what is he, your ward?

Peter Parker: No. I'm Peter, by the way.

Stephen Strange: Dr. Strange.

Peter Parker: Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.

Tony Stark: This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.

Stephen Strange: [Walks closer to Tony] Can we control it? Fly us home? [Tony is lost in bad memories and does not respond right away.] Stark?

Tony Stark: Yeah?

Stephen Strange: Can you get us home?

Tony Stark: Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking... I'm not so sure we should.

Stephen Strange: Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.

Tony Stark: [Stalks over to Strange] No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?

Stephen Strange: [Pauses] Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.

Tony Stark: Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight. [Stepping over to Peter, he formally taps each of Peter's shoulders with the edge of his hand, dubbing him as is done at a knighting.] Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now. [He doesn't look at him as he says those words, knowing well what he is signing him up for.]

[Peter looks at Tony in disbelief, and then cycles through delight, satisfaction, pride and determination, and braces himself for what's to come.]

[Cut to Thanos' mother-ship, Sanctuary II, which dwarfs the massive ring-ships the Black Order have been using. Gamora sits near the throne deep inside the ship. Thanos walks up, bringing a cup of food and holds it out to her.]

Thanos: I thought you might be hungry.

[Gamora takes it, then hurls it across the room where it bangs against Thanos' throne with a loud clack.]

Gamora: I always hated that chair.

Thanos: So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.

Gamora: I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.

Thanos: You told me that too. [Thanos mounts two of the four steps to his throne, turns, and sits on the second from the top.] Every day. For almost twenty years.

Gamora: I was a child when you took me.

Thanos: I saved you.

Gamora: No. No. We were happy on my home planet.

Thanos: Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.

Gamora: Because you murdered half the planet.

Thanos: A small price to pay for salvation.

Gamora: You're insane.

Thanos: Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.

Gamora: You don't know that!

Thanos: [Scowls as his egotistical narcissism prevents him from fully listening to her] I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it. [He stands again and walks back to Gamora] For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.

Gamora: I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.

Thanos: And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.

Gamora: I'm sorry I disappointed you.

Thanos: I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it. [Leans down to put their heads at a level, whispering fiercely] But because you did. [Looks at her] And you lied.

[Thanos and Gamora stand outside a large solid door that slides open vertically as they approach, then pause as a set of inner doors made of interlacing metal slide away. Inside, we see Nebula face-on, suspended horizontally in the air in the middle of the room, her breath shuddering in pain.]

Gamora: Nebula.

[Gamora hurries to to Nebula's left side, and we now see that she has been partially disassembled, her components stretched apart -- a cybernetic version of the medieval torture rack. Hannibal Lecter level of brutality.]

Gamora: Don't do this.

Thanos: Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.

Gamora: Please don't do this.

Thanos: And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.

[Thanos curls his gauntleted fist, activating both the Power and Space Stones, scowling -- causing Nebula's already extended pieces to stretch further outward. She begins to scream.]

Gamora: Stop. Stop it. [She puts her hands on the gauntlet, pulling it down] I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.

[Thanos signals a nearby servant who taps on a control pad. We hear Nebula's voice say, "Accessing memory files" and a sort of hologram of Gamora's face shudders to life.]

Memory Nebula: You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them.

Memory Gamora: He can never get them all.

Memory Nebula: He will!

Memory Gamora: He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.

[The memory ends.]

Thanos: [To Gamora, walking around behind her] You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it. [His voice drips with disgust] Where is the Soul Stone? [He raises his gauntlet next to Gamora's face. Nebula shakes her head, expression terrified, to encourage her sister's silence but when Gamora does not answer, Thanos clenches the gauntlet again, brow furrowed at his adopted daughter as the Power and Space Stones are reactivated. Gamora grimaces in shared pain at her sister's screams, growing louder as Thanos increases the pressure.]

Gamora: Vormir! [Thanos unclenches his hand, and Nebula gasps in air as her parts snap back almost into place. Gamora goes to her and caresses her face.] The Stone is on Vormir.

Thanos: [Satisfied.] Show me.

[Cut to the pod taking Thor, Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir.]

Groot: [Irritably] I am Groot. (Translation: I need to tinkle.)

Rocket: Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.

Groot: [Still irritably] I am Groot. (Translation: But the cup is full.)

Thor: [While looking out the rear portholes] Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.

Rocket: You speak Groot?

Thor: Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.

Groot: [Shortly] I am Groot. (Translation: How long 'till we get there?)

Thor: You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star. [Nostalgically] It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.

[Rocket turns to see Thor sitting sadly beside the window, and sighs.]

Rocket: [To himself] Okay, time to be the captain. [Walks to a console near by Thor, presses two buttons] So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.

Thor: Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.

Rocket: And you said your sister and your dad?

Thor: Both dead.

Rocket: Still got a mom, though?

Thor: Killed by a dark elf.

Rocket: A best friend?

Thor: Stabbed through the heart.

Rocket: Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?

Thor: [Smiling widely but also trying to convince himself] Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.

Rocket: Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is.

Thor: Well, he's never fought me.

Rocket: Yeah, he has!

Thor: He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.

Rocket: Better be some hammer.

Thor: You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.

Rocket: And what if you're wrong?

Thor: If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?

[Thor sniffs and hastily wipes below his eye. He stands and seats himself at the front of the pod, beside Groot.]

Rocket: [Under his breath] I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot. [Rocket takes an eyeball from somewhere on his person] Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball. [He gives Thor the eyeball.]

Thor: What's this?

Rocket: What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.

Thor: He gave you his eye?

Rocket: He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.

Thor: Thank you, sweet rabbit.

[Thor proceeds to put the eyeball in his socket. We are thankfully spared the explicit insertion.]

Rocket: Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...[beeping] Hey, we're here!

Thor: [Smacking his palm against the side of his head to get the eye calibrated] I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.

Rocket: It ain't the eye.

[Nidavellir is dark and motionless as the three rings around it.]

Thor: Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.

[The pod flies through massive machinery, cold and inert. Screen title: NIDAVELLIR]

[The pod sets down; Thor, Rocket and Groot disembark and start walking through a seemingly abandoned and cluttered space. Groot is still playing his game.]

Rocket: I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.

Thor: This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries....

Rocket: [Pauses, looking at a pedestal] You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?

Thor: Yes. Why?

Rocket: Look anything like that? [In fact, it looks exactly like that]

Groot: [Uneasily] I am Groot.

Thor: [Urgently] Go back to the pod.

[Suddenly a massive figure storms towards them, flinging Thor away with one swing of his arm, and kicking Rocket and Groot against a wall of equipment.]

Thor: Eitri, wait! Stop!

Eitri: Thor?

[Eitri is played by the legendary Peter Dinklage -- his giant size literally juxtaposing his name of dwarf.]

Thor: What happened here?

Eitri: You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!

Thor: Asgard is destroyed. [Thor scrambles to his feet and points. Eitri stop his attack on Thor. He now believes Thanos had destroyed Asgard and leaving him in a similar survivor role like Eitri himself.] Eitri, the glove. What did you do?

Eitri: [He walks brokenly across the space to sit heavily, leaning against an ore skip. Rocket and Groot get to their feet, the sapling checking his game.] 300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. 'Your life is yours,' he said. 'But your hands are mine alone.' [He holds up his immobile metal fists, encased in hardened molten metal.]

Thor: Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed: every ax, hammer, sword - it's all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.

[Cut to Nebula suspended in the interrogation room seen earlier, while a technician puts her back together. Nebula ejects her eyepiece and snaps the neck of the tech when he comes close enough to replace it. She walks to a console, straightening her left arm, dragging her still-dislocated right foot behind her, and inputs a code.]

Nebula: Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.

[Cut to Peter Parker, Tony Stark, and Dr. Strange aboard the ship approaching the surface of Titan.]

Peter Parker: [To Tony] Hey, what's going on?

Stephen Strange: I think we're here.

Tony Stark: I don't think this rig has a self-park function. [Urgently] Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?

Peter Parker: Yep, got it.

Tony Stark: This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.

Peter Parker: Okay. Okay. Ready.

[The ringship is heading straight for the center of what looks like one of a colossal game of jacks.]

Peter Parker: We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!!

[Iron Man armors up as the ringship clips the "jack" obliquely, but still losing a good third of its hull in the collision. Spider-Man throws up his helmet at the same time. Doctor Strange steps between them and creates the Shield of the Seraphim around them all, anticipating a rough landing.]

[The ship, now reduced to about 45%, plows through the dirt and stops, leaning slightly to one side. Screen title: TITAN.]

[Doctor Strange helps Tony, now de-helmeted, to his feet; they're both panting a little from the exertion of arrival.]

Tony Stark: [To Doctor Strange] You alright? [Panting] That was close. I owe you one.

[Spider-Man descends from above in classically spider-like fashion.]

Peter Parker: Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.

Tony Stark: [While pointing at Peter] I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?

Peter Parker: I'm trying to say that... something is coming.

[A grenade rolls into view, and Peter, Strange and Tony get thrown well back when it fires its energy pulse. Star-Lord, Drax, and Mantis appear in the doorway]

Drax: [Yelling] THANOS!!!! [He flings a blade at Doctor Strange, who neatly deflects it with a mystical shield, and in return sends the Cloak of Levitation at Drax's face, half-smothering him and throwing him to the floor. Star-Lord and Iron Man have a brief dogfight until a magnetic disc pins Iron Man face-first to a structure.]

Peter Parker: [Crawling backwards frantically from an anxious-looking Mantis] AH! Whoawhoawhoawhoa! PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME!

[Spider-Man shoots web at Mantis in a panic, pinning arms to her body just before Star-Lord flies at him feet-first, kicking him away.]

Peter Quill: Stay down, clown!

[Star-Lord can't quite counter spider reflexes at first; he fires at Spider-Man, who extends his spider legs and leaps away, but an electric-like cord wraps around Spider-Man and his six new legs when he tries to attack, sending him rolling across the deck.]

Drax: [Struggling with the Cloak of Levitation] Die, blanket of death!

[Iron Man pulls free of the magnet; the Cloak pulls free of Drax as soon as Iron Man has a bead on his opponent and a foot on his torso.]

[Star-Lord has Spider-Man in a head-lock, gun pointed at the smaller man's head.]

[Doctor Strange has a mystical shield of golden energy up, and stands ready at the third point of the triangle. Mantis has struggled to her feet behind Star-Lord, still covered with webbing.]

Peter Quill: Alright, everybody, stay where you are... chill the F out. [Star-Lord powers off his helmet] I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?

Tony Stark: [De-helmeting] Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?

Drax: I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?

Peter Quill: Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French-fry this little freak.

Tony Stark: Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go! [Tony extends his nano-tech cannon, looking uncannily like an electric shark about to eat Drax's face.]

Drax: Do it, Quill! I can take it.

Mantis: No, he can't take it!

Stephen Strange: [Completely deadpan] She's right. You can't.

Peter Quill: Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself. [To Spider-Man] Starting with you.

Stephen Strange: Wait, what. Thanos? [Trying to inject clarity and sanity into the situation] Alright, let me ask you this one time: What master do you serve?

Peter Quill: What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? "Jesus"?

Tony Stark: [Getting it] You're from Earth?

Peter Quill: I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.

Tony Stark: Yeah, that's on Earth, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?

Peter Parker: [Sounding slightly crushed] So, you're not with Thanos?

Peter Quill: [Indignantly] With Thanos?! No, I'm here to kill Thanos! He took my girl- Wai- who are you?

Peter Parker: [De-helmets] We're the Avengers, man.

Peter Quill: Oh.

Mantis: You're the ones Thor told us about!

Tony Stark: You know Thor!?

Peter Quill: Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking, [Peter gives him an incredulous look] needed saving.

Doctor Strange: [Pause] Where is he now?

[Cut to Nivadellir where Eitri is showing Thor, Rocket, and Groot the mold for Stormbreaker.]

Rocket: This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?

Eitri: It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.

Thor: Did it have a name?

Eitri: Stormbreaker.

Rocket: That's a bit much.

Thor: So how do we make it?

Eitri: You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.

Thor: Rabbit, fire up the pod.

[Cut to Titan where the remaining Avengers and the Guardians are starting to work together. Quill is measuring the planet's tilt.]

Peter Quill: The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.

[in the background, Mantis is jumping joyfully in a low gravity spot.]

Tony Stark: Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.

[Drax yawns.]

Tony Stark: Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?

Drax: I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."

Tony Stark: [To Quill] Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.

Peter Quill: See, "not winging it" isn't really what they do.

Peter Parker: Uh, what exactly is it that they do?

Mantis: [As fiercely as an 8-week-old kitten] Kick names, take ass.

Drax: Yeah, that's right. [Agrees quietly as he settles into a stance facing the remaining Avengers.]

Tony Stark: [Tony pauses with an expression of deep hopelessness] Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?

Peter Quill: "Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine. [Motions to Drax and Mantis,]

Tony Stark: We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude....

Peter Quill: Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good. [Peter Parker follows the conversation back and forth like a squash rally.]

Drax: Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.

Tony Stark: What dance-off?

Peter Quill: It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.

Peter Parker: Like in Footloose, the movie?

Peter Quill: [Excitedly] Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?

Peter Parker: It never was.

[Quill frowns sadly at him.]

Tony Stark: Don't encourage this, alright?

Peter Parker: Okay.

Tony Stark: We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.

Peter Quill: Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human. [Quill points at Stark and Parker] So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you.

Tony Stark: Your math is blowing my mind.

Mantis: Excuse me, but... does your friend often do that?

[Dr. Strange is sitting cross-legged, floating slightly above the ground, his hands poised in a mystic gesture with the Time Stone glowing brightly in the Eye of Agamotto setting. Green vapor-like energy flows from the stone, and more intricate magical energy patterns circle Dr. Strange's forearms. The Cloak of Levitation flows behind him as if the Stone is creating a strong breeze. His eyes are closed, and his head is jerking rapidly from side to side, the motion blurring, but resembling looking for something.]

Tony Stark: Strange, we alright?

[Dr. Strange snaps out of his trance and falls forward, letting out a cry.]

Tony Stark: You're back. You're alright.

Peter Parker: Hey, what was that?

Stephen Strange: [Panting] I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.

Peter Quill: How many did you see?

Stephen Strange:14,000,605.

Tony Stark: How many did we win?

[Dr. Strange stares intently at Tony for a moment.]

Stephen Strange: [Pause] One.

[Cut to Thanos and Gamora appearing on sand dunes alternating with shallow pools around the base of a mountain. The sun is in full eclipse, lending eerie lighting to the scene. Screen title: VORMIR]

Thanos: The stone had better be up there... for your sister's sake.

[The walk up the mountain seems to be long, but not difficult. Paths worn by centuries or more of feet lead up to the summit, where Thanos and Gamora encounter a floating hooded figure].

Stonekeeper: Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars. Gamora, daughter of Thanos.

Thanos: You know us?

Stonekeeper: It is my curse to know all who journey here.

Thanos: Where's the Soul Stone?

Stonekeeper: You should know... it extracts a terrible price.

Thanos: I am prepared.

Stonekeeper: We all think that at first. [The figure touches down and glides out of the shadows, revealing the face of who we know to be Johann "The Red Skull" Schmidt from Captain America: The First Avenger.] We are all wrong.

[The Stonekeeper guides them to a temple-like structure at the summit.]

Thanos: How is it you know this place so well?

Red Skull: A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.

[They stop on a semicircular engraving overlooking a sheer drop. It descends in three shallow steps to a final half-circle cutout, the whole bisected by a deep cut that runs between the two spires behind them. Far, far below is a full circle with similar engraved decoration.]

Red Skull: What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.

Thanos: What's this?

Red Skull: The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.

Thanos: Tell me what it needs.

Red Skull: To ensure that whoever possesses it... understands its power.... The stone demands a sacrifice.

Thanos: Of what?

Red Skull: In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love. A soul, for a soul.

[Gamora begins to laugh at the irony of the situation.]

Gamora: All my life, I dreamed of a day... a moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now... you kill and torture... and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one.

Thanos: [Turns to face Gamora with tears in his eyes.]

Gamora: Really? Tears?

Red Skull: They're not for him.

[Gamora looks at the Red Skull, and as her bitter smile fades, realizes what is about to happen, as do we.... ]

Gamora: No! This isn't love!

Thanos: [Thoroughly convicted.] I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you. [Gamora stares down unseeing for a moment, then up at the resolution on his face. She grabs the red-jeweled dagger from his belt with lightning reflexes, triggers the blades and stabs herself in the stomach... except it's only bubbles.] I'm sorry, little one. [He grabs Gamora by the arm and walks inexorably to the precipice.]

Gamora: No!

[She tries in vain to break from his grasp, much like she tried to pull free from the Child of Thanos so many years ago, but, pain showing clearly on his face, he throws her over the edge, and watches sorrowfully as she falls to her death. Light pulses overhead as the sacrifice is correctly accomplished.]

[Thanos finds himself lying in one of the shallow pools back at the base of the mountain. He opens his hand and sees that he now has the orange Soul Stone.]

[Cut to the Quinjet where Sam is piloting Rhodey, Steve, Natasha, Wanda, and Vision.]

Steve Rogers: [Walking up to the pilot's seat] Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.

Sam Wilson: I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.

[The Quinjet passes through a camouflage force field into Wakanda's Golden City's valley and lands at the airfield outside the palace. King T'Challa and the Dora Milaje approach to greet the arrivals]

Okoye: [Walking with King T'Challa and a band of the Kingsguard to the landing pad] When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world... this is not what I imagined.

T'Challa: And what did you imagine?

Okoye: The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.

[The occupants of the Quinjet disembark, Steve and Natasha leading, followed by Bruce and Rhodey, with Vision and Wanda slowly taking up the rear.]

Bruce Banner: [To Rhodey] Should we bow?

James Rhodes: [Seriously] Yeah, he's a king.

Steve Rogers: Seems like I'm always thanking you for something. [Shaking hands with King T'Challa.]

[Bruce bows awkwardly to King T'Challa.]

James Rhodes: [Mock shocked] What are you doing?

T'Challa: Uh, we don't do that here. [He dissuades Bruce with a motion of his hand; Bruce shoots Rhodey a look, and is answered with a big grin] So how big of an assault can we expect?

[The group begins to walk back into the administrative building.]

Bruce Banner: Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault.

Natasha Romanoff: How we looking?

King T'Challa: You will have my Kingsguard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...

Bucky Barnes: [Smiling as he walks toward Steve, passing some Kingsguard taking Vision and Wanda to another facility] A semi-stable, 100-year-old man.

[The two friends share a hug.]

Steve Rogers: How you been, Buck?

Bucky Barnes: Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.

[In Shuri's lab, Shuri scans the Stone with her kimoyo beads while Vision lies on the examination table. She flips her hand over and studies the hologram projected over her palm.]

Shuri: Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.

Bruce Banner: Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.

Shuri: Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?

[Vision looks at Bruce as if to ask the same thing.]

Bruce Banner: [Uncertainly] Because, we didn't think of it.

Shuri: [Reassuringly, with a smile] I'm sure you did your best.

Wanda Maximoff: Can you do it?

Shuri: Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. [To King T'Challa] It will take time, brother.

Steve Rogers: How long?

Shuri: As long as you can give me.

Okoye: [Her kimoyo beads chime an alarm; she flicks one bead into her palm, where it projects the globe with a pulsing location marker] Something's entered the atmosphere.

[Outside, Sam and Bucky look up at the sky]

Sam Wilson: [Over the Avengers' comm] Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.

[The defense shield over the Golden City destroys one of the alien vessels when it slams into the field at full attack acceleration.]

Bucky Barnes: God, I love this place.

James Rhodes: [also outside, and now in full War Machine armor watching three more ships burn through the sky] Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome.

[The shock waves and debris from the ship landings destroy acres of forest and boil up against the dome. The lab has an excellent view of the landing sites. Captain America and Black Panther look at each other in concern over the scope of what they'll be facing.]

Vision: [Struggling to sit up and slide off the exam table] It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.

Natasha Romanoff: [Moving toward Vision] Vision, get your ass back on the table.

T'Challa: We will hold them off. [He, Okoye and the guards head for the door.]

Steve Rogers: [To Wanda] Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell.

Wanda Maximoff: I will.

T'Challa: Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures. [He stops, turns, and points at Steve] And get this man a shield.

[Cut to Nivadellir where Rocket is in the pod, and Thor, without any environmental suit, jumps from the hull onto the ring surface with a cable in his hand attached to the pod.]

Rocket: I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.

Thor: Leave that to me.

Rocket: Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a--

Thor: [Thor begins to swing the pod around him in a circle. Rocket screams. Thor builds up speed with three good loops then slacks his grip enough to send the pod shooting straight away from Nidavellir, trailing him behind it like a kite tail.] Fire the engines!

Rocket: [Rocket shakes it off and puts the proverbial pedal to the metal.] Nnnyah!

Thor: [As the pod skims over the surface of the next ring out, Thor reaches down and digs one hand into the surface, then both feet, finally getting a foothold against the forward motion of the pod. The ice-like accumulation around the ring axis crackles.] MORE... POWER... RABBIT!

[Thor commits bicep porn while Rocket accelerates for all he's worth. Finally the rings spin free, realigning into effective configuration as the star bursts back into life.]

Eitri: Well done, boy.

[Thor, clutching the pod's forward windows, points to the star.]

Thor: That's Nivadellir!

[Rocket gazes amazed at the blazing core. An iris on the cladding around the star opens, firing pure stellar heat through the ring portals and into the forge... until the damaged mechanism fails, crumbles loose and slams shut. The iris closes and the beam of light trails off.]

Eitri: Damn it.

Rocket: "Damn it"? What's "damn it"?

Eitri: The mechanism is crippled.

Thor: What?

Eitri: With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.

Thor: How long will it take to heat?

Eitri: A few minutes, maybe more. Why?

Thor: [Standing up on the pod hull] I'm gonna hold it open.

Eitri: That's suicide.

Thor: So is facing Thanos without that ax. [He leaps from the pod to the star's iris.]

[Cut to the Wakandan battlefield. Carriers hover over the ground with Wakandan soldiers and Natasha, Steve and Bucky on board; Rhodey and Sam keep pace overhead, and Bruce is in the Hulkbuster armor.]

Natasha Romanoff: How we looking, Bruce?

Bruce Banner: [Leaping jogging along, keeping up with the carriers, and utterly delighted] Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually-- [he stumbles on a rock, and a carrier goes by, from which Okoye gives him a dubious look. He stands] I'm okay. I'm okay.

James Rhodes: I got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.

[The heat signatures are Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian.]

[The carrier pilots swerve into U-turns, causing their craft to tilt and allowing the practiced soldiers to slide over one side into a run, never coming to a complete halt. A Dora Milaje shouts a command nearby as the last Wakandans join ranks.]

Jabari Warriors: MIE EFFA! (Win them!) YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! [M'Baku, Lord of the Jabari, rallies his soldiers with a war chant. He stops as King T'Challa nears him.]

T'Challa: [Clasps wrists with M'Baku] Thank you for standing with us.

M'Baku: [Translated from Xhosa] Of course, brother.

[The Black Panther, Captain America, and Black Widow walk to the edge of the barrier, where Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian stand. Proxima tests the strength of the barrier by drawing her sword across it consideringly.]

Natasha Romanoff: Where's your other friend?

Proxima Midnight: You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone.

Steve Rogers: That's not gonna happen.

T'Challa: You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.

Proxima Midnight: We... have blood to spare. [She brandishes her sword with a snarl, and the ships behind her start raising their outer hulls to allow their "passengers" to disembark.]

[The three heroes return to the massed forces.]

Bucky Barnes: [A touch sardonically] Did they surrender?

Steve Rogers: Not exactly.

[The Black Panther leads the Wakandans in the war cry "Yibambe!" telling them to hold fast as the Outriders bound toward the barrier; Proxima drops her sword arm down in the signal to attack.]

Bucky Barnes: [Flatly, astonished at the numbers of Outriders] What the hell.

Natasha Romanoff: Looks like we pissed her off.

Okoye: [Horrified, as the Outriders bombard the force-field, squeezing limbs and bodies partly through only to be bisected.] They're killing themselves.

[As a few Outriders managed to squeeze through intact, the Border Tribe take a knee and raise their shields. The Kingsguard behind them level their sonic spears over their comrades' shoulders, and on Black Panther's command, fire at the approaching monsters. The Winter Soldier uses his M-249 machine gun, and Bruce fires the Hulkbuster's hand repulsors.]

Sam Wilson: [Sending Redwings into the fight as he flies, swooping to fire at them with his Steyr pistols] You seen the teeth on those things?

James Rhodes: Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed. [He flies over the heaviest concentration of Outriders and drops a barrage of mines, all exploding fantastically.]

[Everyone notices a pack of Outriders starting to run around the force-field to the right of the defenders' position.]

Bruce Banner: Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us... there's nothing between them and Vision.

Steve Rogers: [Grimly] Them we better keep 'em in front of us.

Okoye: [To the Black Panther] How do we do that?

T'Challa: We open the barrier. [Putting his comm to his mouth] On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.

Dome Control: [Nervous and unsure] Requesting confirmation, my King. You said open the barrier?

T'Challa: On my signal.

M'Baku: [To Okoye] This will be the end of Wakanda.

Okoye: Then it will be the noblest ending in history.

[Captain America readies one of his Vibranium hand guards. The Black Panther shouts a command in Xhosa; the Border Tribesmen disengage their shields and stand, as the Black Panther walks out in front of them, never taking his eyes off the enemy.]

T'Challa: WAKANDA FOREVER!!!! [He crosses his arms in the Wakandan salute and closes his Black Panther helmet, charging for the barrier. The heroes and leaders are at the fore of the charge. Halfway to the barrier, the Black Panther shouts into his comm] Now!

[The Outriders pour through, distracted from trying to find any other access. The Black Panther and Captain America pull ahead rapidly due to their enhancements, and literally leap into battle.]

T'Challa: [Over his comm] How much longer, Shuri?

Shuri: We've barely begun, brother. [A delicate and intricate construction of gold light hovers at her eye level; as she manipulates it, the waldo tools reproduce her commands on the Mind Stone itself.]

T'Challa: You might want to pick up the pace.

[Simultaneously, Thor prepares to open the iris of Nidavellir.]

Thor: Allfathers, give me strength.

Eitri: You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you.

Thor: Only if I die. [Takes deep breaths.]

Eitri: [Boggled] Yes. That's what... "killing you" means.

[Thor grasps the two levers and pulls them down and towards himself, slowly opening the iris. The stream of stellar energy blasts pasts him and into the forge once again.]

Eitri: Hold it! Hold it, Thor!

[Eitri watches the metal ingots melt while Thor is looking increasingly charred. Finally, Eitri is able to tip the cauldron, pouring the metal into the mold just as Thor passes out. The jet carries him into the forge, Rocket follows hastily and landing after Thor bounces limply off a structure to land on the floor. Groot finally looks up from his game at the thump Thor's body makes.]

Rocket: [Kneeling over Thor] Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay? [Thor looks far from "okay".]

[Eitri clumsily and urgently pulls the mold, still glowing red-hot, onto the floor, breaking it loose from its frame, then starts punching the mold itself with his metal fists to free the ax.]

Rocket: I think he's dying!

Eitri: He needs the ax! Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle!

[Stormbreaker's two sections -- the hammer and the ax-blade -- lay glowing on the floor. Groot looks sadly at Thor, then scowls with determination. He stands, and extends his fingers towards Stormbreaker, growing them at extraordinary speed. As he twines them around the two parts, he cries out at the burning pain but does not hesitate, slamming them together and locking them permanently into one structure. He raises it above his head, and with a mighty cry, chops his extended arm with his other hand to sever it at the right length.Thor's fingers twitch, and the new weapon levitates in a crackle of lightning echoed by the sparks between Thor's fingers.]

[The remaining Avengers and Wakandans are struggling against the Outriders. The Winter Soldier goes down, and fights off Outrider fangs snapping at his head. Captain America and the Black Panther still fight side-by-side. War Machine hovers over the breach, pouring ammunition into the flood of bodies until a huge hammer -- Cull Obsidian's -- knocks him out of the sky and to the ground. The Hulkbuster is dogpiled and pinned.]

Bruce Banner: There’s too many of them! GYAH! AAAAHHHHH!

[Suddenly, a large beam of rainbow-hued light lands in the middle of the action, and an ax flies out of it, wreathed with lightning and tearing through the Outriders, freeing the heroes. It flies back to the light and into its master's hand just as the beam cuts out, revealing Thor, Groot and Rocket [The Avengers theme swelling triumphantly at their arrival] who chambers a round in his large gun. Black Widow, Captain America and the Black Panther pause in astonishment. Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian pause in apprehension.]

Bruce Banner: [Opening the Hulkbuster's helm and laughing with joy] AH-hahaha! You guys are so screwed now!

Thor: BRING ME THANOS! [He charges toward the hordes of Outriders, followed by Groot and Rocket, lightning gathering around him until he finally launches himself into the air, lands in the densest concentration of Outriders and makes a crater where they had stood.]

[Cut to Titan, where Thanos arrives, finding only fresh debris from Ebony Maw's ship.]

Stephen Strange: [Sitting on what may have been plaza steps once] Oh, yeah, you're much more of a "Thanos."

Thanos: I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.

Stephen Strange: You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.

Thanos: And where do you think he brought you? [Star-Lord crouches behind wreckage with his weapon ready, behind Thanos and to his left; Spider-Man peeks from above and behind Doctor Strange.]

Stephen Strange: Let me guess. Your home?

Thanos: [Smiling reminiscently] It was. And it was beautiful. [Thanos curls his gauntleted fist and activates the Reality Stone to show Strange Titan before it was destroyed -- green lawns, intact buildings, water-filled ponds, strolling citizens, the jack-like structures hovering and connected to the ground-based buildings with beams of energy.] Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.

Stephen Strange: Genocide.

Thanos: But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass. [He relaxes his fist; the Stone stops glowing and the illusion fades back into the true state of Titan.]

Stephen Strange: [Sarcastically] Congratulations. You're a prophet.

Thanos: I'm a survivor.

Stephen Strange: Who wants to murder trillions.

Thanos: With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that... mercy.

Stephen Strange: [Stands] And then what?

Thanos: I finally rest... and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.

Stephen Strange: [He summons his Mandalas, entering a fighting pose] I think... you'll find... our will... equal to yours.

Thanos: Ours? [He looks up to a see a chunk of wreckage descending rapidly on him, too rapidly to react -- and powered by Iron Man. He is subsequently crushed by it.]

Tony Stark: [Flying in] Piece of cake, Quill.

Peter Quill: [Triggers his mask and follows] Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!

[The wreckage on top of Thanos erupts in purple, as he bellows in rage. He turns the hovering fragments into a flock of bats with the Reality Stone and swarms Iron Man with them, driving him back through the ruins.]

[Spider-Man webs his eyes, and swings in to kick him in the face at the same time that Drax leaps from cover, blades in both hands, to knee-slide behind Thanos and try for a tendon slide across the back of the Titan's knee.]

[Doctor Strange jumps through a portal and summons a sword of golden energy, dueling with Thanos while Drax attacks similarly on his other side. Thanos punches Drax through a ruined wall, then shatters the blade with one hand and tears the web from his eyes. He advances on Doctor Strange and kicks at him, but Strange's shield absorbs the damage -- the Cloak lifts him free of the ground.]

[Star-Lord has been making his way back on the ground, and shoots Thanos from behind. Thanos uses the Power Stone to shoot balls of energy at Star-Lord while Star-Lord leaps towards Thanos using magical platforms thrown in his path by Doctor Strange, the last one placed above Thanos' head so Star-Lord can flip over him and slap a mine on Thanos' back. Star-Lord sticks his landing, he disengages his helmet, flips Thanos a bird and falls backward into a portal.]

Peter Quill: Boom!

[The explosion knocks Thanos to his knees and dazes him briefly.]

Stephen Strange: [Whispers to the Cloak of Levitation] Do not let him close his fist. [The Cloak swoops off Doctor Strange's shoulders and wraps itself tightly around Thanos' armored hand, who starts tugging at this unexpected wrapping.]

[Doctor Strange starts throwing portals everywhere. Spider-Man leaps through one on Thanos' left]

Peter Parker: Magic! [He punches Thanos in the head and vanishes through a portal to the lower right before reappearing above Thanos] More magic! [He yanks Thanos' head down hard, then leaps into a portal in front of him. He leaps through another portal high and behind Thanos] Magic with a kick! [Delivers a flying kick and falls feet-first into an exit, then appears on his right] Magic with a--

[Before he can finish Thanos turns, grabbing him from the air, and throwing him to the ground, with his hand around his neck.]

Thanos: Insect!

[He then throws him at Doctor Strange, knocking them both down. Thanos finally tears the Cloak away and is then promptly surrounded by fiery explosions as Iron Man bombards him. He sucks all the flame into the gauntlet with the Power Stone and fires it in a stream at Iron Man, hitting him dead on and sending him far away, plowing through a massive fallen machine.]

[Spider-Man leaps from behind, more conventionally this time, while Thanos concentrates his fire on Iron Man, webs the gauntlet and drops down in front of him, pulling hard -- but Thanos yanks on the web-line, pulling the much lighter teenager towards him, and punching him on his way past. He tears the webbing free of the gauntlet just in time for a small spaceship to attempt to crash-land on him.]

[The ship drags Thanos along for a distance, burying him under debris. He stands just as the pilot leaps in a great arc to punch him, landing in front of him with an energy-blade at the ready.]

Thanos: Well, well.

Nebula: You should have killed me.

Thanos: It would've been a waste of parts!

Nebula: [She runs at Thanos, attacking him with her sword] Where's Gamora?!

[Thanos punches her away. Doctor Strange uses the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to pinion the gauntlet, pulling Thanos' fingers open and trying to pry the gauntlet off his hand.]

[Thanos tries to pull free, as Drax slides in from his right, kicking his knee and knocking him off-balance, then wrapping himself around Thanos' kneeling leg.]

[Star-Lord shoots a electric trap onto the ground to Thanos' right, the tangle-field holding down his unarmored hand.]

[Spider-Man swings in, webs Thanos' chest then wraps it around behind him, digging his Iron Spider legs into the ground to anchor himself.]

[Doctor Strange opens a portal straight above Thanos' out of which drops Mantis, landing on the Titan's shoulders, her hands on his temples. He bellows as she tries to put him under.]

[Iron Man, having returned, is pulling on the gauntlet. Doctor Strange reapplies the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to reinforce the trap's hold on Thanos' right hand, and the Cloak helps him pull. Thanos is finally subdued enough to incapacitate, not fully asleep.]

Tony Stark: [While pulling] Is he under? Don't let up.

Mantis: [Starting to cry] Be quick. He is very strong.

Tony Stark: Parker, help! Get over here. [Spider-Man drops his web-line, and hurries to help Tony with the gauntlet] She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.

Peter Quill: [Flies over to join the others, stands in front of Thanos, tauntingly] I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?

Thanos: My Gamora...?

Peter Quill: No, bull-shit. Where is she?

Mantis: [Shocked] He is in anguish.

Peter Quill: Good.

Mantis: [Crying] He… he mourns.

Drax: What does this monster have to mourn?

Nebula: Gamora.

Peter Quill: [Pause] What?

Nebula: [Realizing with horror and sadness what has happened] He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone... but she didn't.

Tony Stark: [Frasps the danger immediately and de-helmets] Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand?

[Quill slowly turns to Thanos,]

Tony Stark: [Shouting his pleads desperately] Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!

Peter Quill: Tell me she's lying. [Enraged] Asshole! Tell me you didn't do it!

Thanos: I... had... to.

Peter Quill: [While starting to tear up; quietly] No, you didn't…! No, you didn't…! [He continues to rage and then pistol-whipping Thanos twice in the face, causing Mantis to let go in pain.] NO, YOU DIDN'T!

Tony Stark: Quill!

[Iron Man leaps for Star-Lord's arm, re-helmeting and leaving Spider-Man to pull off the gauntlet.]

Tony Stark: [To the struggling Star-Lord] Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!

Peter Parker: It's coming! It's coming! It's coming! [Getting the fingers completely loose] I got it! I got it.... !

[Thanos wakes completely, now well and truly furious. He head-butts Mantis, grabbing the cuff of the gauntlet just as it is sliding off his hand, causing Spider-Man to stumble back, and then throwing Mantis away off his shoulders.]

Peter Parker: [Seeing Mantis with far too much air under her] Oh, God. [He jumps and wraps his arms and legs around her, extending his spider legs to form a roll cage for a safe landing.]

[Thanos kicks Drax off his right leg and into Nebula and Star-Lord, knocking them down. He yanks on the Crimson Bands holding his right hand to throw Doctor Strange far away, and swats away Iron Man and his repulsor shots. The remaining Guardians jump up and charge him again, but he fires a pulse of indigo energy at them that knocks the three of them completely unconscious.]

[Iron Man zooms back in, his nanite arm cannon manifested, and is head-butted to the ground. Thanos looks at him for a beat, then raises the gauntlet towards Titan's moon. Iron Man stares, aghast. Thanos uses a combination of the Power and Space Stones to shatter the moon's surface, then bring the debris down on the field of battle at speed. Iron Man powers out of the way but is caught by a chunk of moon about the size of a baseball field, slamming him into the ground. The Guardians go sailing into the air from the rebound.]

[Back in Wakanda, Shuri is working steadily to complete the Mind Stone's removal; Wanda stands by tensely]

[The Kingsguard, Borderers and Jabari have little success going against Cull Obsidian's chained hammer -- he either sends them flying or punches them into the ground. The Black Panther gets free of his other sorties, leaps and uses all his collected kinetic energy behind a punch that lays Obsidian flat.]

Rocket: [Having found a clear spot] Come and get some, space dogs! [Another wave of Outriders heads right for the raccoon-oid. The Winter Soldier, having come up behind Rocket, grabs him with his mechanical arm, holds him at arms length and spins 540 degrees, firing his own M-249 at the same time.] Come on, get some, get some! Come on, get some! [The Winter Soldier drops Rocket, who looks up at him with an impressed gleam] How much for the gun?

Bucky Barnes: [Snaps off another burst] Not for sale.

Rocket: Okay, how much for the arm? [The Winter Soldier just gives him a look and moves off] Oh, I'll get that arm.

[The tides of battle cause Thor, using Stormbreaker to great effect, and Captain America together. They take a breather.]

Steve Rogers: [Panting] New haircut?

Thor: [Grinning] Notice you've copied my beard.

[Captain America nods, wearily gesturing at his own face with a shield-covered hand. Groot skewers three Outriders with his right arm.]

Thor: By the way, this is a friend of mine. Tree. [Gestures towards Groot with Stormbreaker]

Groot: [In full battle snarl] I AM GROOT! (Translation: You gonna help me or what?!)

Steve Rogers: [Formally, but bemused] I am Steve Rogers.

[In Shuri's lab, a deep rumbling can be heard even at their height. Wanda looks down on the battlefield, and sees movement through the blazing forest between the troopships and the dome. When the disturbance reaches the edge of the trees, it turns into vast moving mounds of earth that easily bypass the force field and emerge -- Threshers, sets of massive, motorized spiked wheels, intended for nothing more than shredding everything in their paths.]

T'Challa: Fall back! Fall back now!

[Wanda watches as at least one set of Threshers separates into individual wheels and starts veering all over the battlefield, and then looks anxiously back at Vision]

James Rhodes: Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.

Sam Wilson: I'm doing it. [The two fliers use their firepower to crack a Thresher but cannot find a weak spot.]

[Black Widow with her escrima sticks and Okoye with her augmented spear have drifted together when they're suddenly in the path of a Thresher. Both women cringe at their seemingly inevitable shredding when the Scarlet Witch lands in front of both of them, eyes glowing red, lifting the whole Thresher well clear of the ground. Looking behind her, the friendly forces have scattered and replaced by a charging mob of Outriders -- the perfect place to throw a Thresher. Black Widow straightens with a pleased smile, Okoye with an amazed look.]

Okoye: [A touch indignant] Why was she up there all this time?

[The Children of Thanos help answer that question.]

Proxima Midnight: She's on the field. Take it.

[Corvus Glaive kills one of the guards just outside the lab, alerting Shuri to the problem. She starts hastily disconnecting her equipment from Vision's systems; he gasps at the sensations. The Dora Milaje engages Glaive but is sent skidding across the floor. Shuri finishes her shutdown, grabs one of her sonic panther-paws and fires at Glaive. The Dora attacks again, and Glaive sends both her and Shuri through the balcony railing and onto the main lab floor.]

[Vision is not where Corvus Glaive expects to find him. Vision is, in fact, charging at him and knocking him out the window to fall many meters down the face of Mount Bashenga.]

Sam Wilson: Guys, we got a Vision situation here. [He's tackled by a leaping Outrider and grounded.]

Steve Rogers: Somebody get to Vision!

Bruce Banner: I got him! [Bruce has figured out the Hulkbusters repulsor thrusters and makes a beeline for the android.]

Wanda Maximoff: On my way. [She is clobbered by Proxima Midnight's pommel and rolls down into the large ditch from the Thresher before she can move.]

Proxima Midnight: [Jumping down next to the Scarlet Witch] He'll die alone. As will you.

Natasha Romanoff: She's not alone.

[Okoye silently brandishes her spear on the other side of Proxima and nods at Black Widow.]

Proxima Midnight: Euuyaaah! [She leaps for Black Widow, who has joined her sticks into a full staff. She blocks Proxima's blow with an electrical crackle while Okoye runs around the slope to also attack from the front.]

[Corvus Glaive kicks Vision, knocking him down; as he attempts to rise again, Cull Obsidian shows up and swings his hammer in a full arc, throwing Vision even further. He painfully starts to climb to his feet again when a whooshing overhead interrupts the fight as Bruce Banner lands the Hulkbuster between the aliens and the android. He takes a defensive stance, pointing one hand's repulsor at each.]

Bruce Banner: Oh no, oh no you don't. This isn't going to be like New York, pal. This suit's already kicked the crap out of the Hulk-- [Cull Obsidian jumps forward, grabs Bruce's right arm and Bruce in reflex grabs Obsidian's hammer; a jet fires, taking the two of them in a random direction, to the base of a waterfall.]

Bruce Banner: Guys! Vision needs backup now! [Obsidian pulls the Hulkbuster up and kicks it in the small of the back.] [Trying to change into the Hulk while fighting Cull Obsidian in the Hulkbuster armor] Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second. [Bruce extends his left hand protectively; Obsidian grabs the armor's hand, chops the shoulder joint with a relatively small axe then does a roll over Bruce's back to leverage snapping off the Hulkbuster's whole arm] Ahhhhh! Hulk! Hulk! HULK!

Hulk: [Banner's face briefly becomes the Hulk] NOOOO!!!

Bruce Banner: Oh, screw you, ya big green asshole! I'll do it myself! [To Obsidian] Come on!

[He charges the alien, jumps into the air and delivers an effective punch with his remaining hand -- swat, punch, hammer -- except that blow is caught by Obsidian, who punches back, knocking Bruce flat. Obsidian changes his left hand armor into a pointed weapon, and lunges forward to deliver a likely fatal blow, when Bruce grabs the detached Hulkbuster arm out of the water, holding it so Obsidian impales that instead, and slaps the controls.]

Bruce Banner: See you later, Alligator! [The repulsors fire, taking Cull Obsidian high into the air -- high enough, in fact, to intersect the defense dome. The Hulkbuster arm drags Obsidian against the field to grotesque destructive effect, ending in a very final explosion.] Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.

[Proxima Midnight alternates heavy blows between her two opponents, but all three of them duck as a single-wheel Thresher tears overhead, the ditch sparing them most of the danger from the wheel-blades. Proxima uses the distraction to kick Black Widow in the face, sending her to the ground. She then grabs Okoye by the shoulder and weapon and throws her meters away.]

[Simultaneously, Corvus Glaive and Vision struggle in the forest at the foot of Mount Bashenga. Glaive grasps Vision's shoulder and uses the leverage to plunge his blade once more into the android's chest.]

Corvus Glaive: I thought you were formidable, machine. But you're dying, like any man. [He yanks his blade out, and Vision collapses. As he bends over his fallen opponent to retrieve the Stone, he's tackled by Captain America at full speed.]

Steve Rogers: Get outta here! [He exchanges blows with Glaive, using his arm-shields as offence as well as defense, then turns to Vision again] GO!

[Black Widow splits her staff back into a pair of sticks to block Proxima Midnight's sword blows, and finally knocks it from her hand. The alien takes to her bare fists instead, knocks down and pins the Black Widow. Proxima triggers an arm-blade from her left-arm armor, and stabs at Black Widow, who barely manages to block the blade with her crossed sticks. As the edge starts to dig into Black Widow's neck anyway, scarlet energy grabs the alien and tosses her into the air right into the path of another passing Thresher. Dark blue blood spatters the women below. The Scarlet Witch sits up, sighing with relief, her hands still shimmering.]

Natasha Romanoff: That was really gross.

[Captain America keeps blocking Corvus Glaive's staff weapon using his shields, finally knocking it from the alien's hands just before he's thrown over a fallen tree and pinned, Glaive's hand at his throat. Even with his physical abilities, Captain America's struggling -- until a glaive-blade pierces Glaive's chest, and is pushed all the way through. Vision raises his enemy in a perfect mirror of the first attack on him, and holds him for a moment, before dropping Glaive's corpse to one side and collapsing exhaustively.]

Steve Rogers: [helping him back up] I thought I told you to go.

Vision: We don't trade lives, Captain.

[The remaining Guardians and Avengers are dealing with the gravitic aftermath of dumping a large chunk of moon onto an unstable planet's surface. The unconscious Guardians are flying upwards uncontrollably, moon-chunks are still making fiery ballistic in-bounds, and random debris and massive rocks are floating in any possible direction. Spider-Man is well-equipped to handle this physically, even if he's freaking out emotionally.]

Peter Parker: [Webs Mantis] I got you! I got you! [Snags Drax, securing both of them to something not moving] I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names! [Reels in Star-Lord]

[The Cloak of Levitation sets Doctor Strange down on a relatively stable outcrop as Thanos extricates himself from rubble. The Sorcerer Supreme makes a few passes with his hands, producing the familiar golden magic filigree circles, and slams his hands down on the rock before him, invoking the Seven Suns of Cinnibus as a lightning-like effect of immense heat jumping from rock to rock until it reaches Thanos, sending him flying -- but he makes use of the erratic gravity to keep control and fire back a blast from the Power Stone.]

[Doctor Strange blocks the purple plume with a wall of Mirror Dimension, which he then pushes back at Thanos. It shatters around the Titan, who suctions the magic into a miniature black hole with the Space Stone, volleying it back at Doctor Strange. Just in time, Doctor Strange raises a shield and changes the dark energy into a swarm of aqua butterflies which return to their master.]

[Before Thanos can counterattack again, Doctor Strange levitates and invokes the Images of Ikonn, giving him arms like a Hindu deity before dozens of Strange replications rush away, forming a circular wall around a snarling Thanos. They call cast magical cords, wrapping around Thanos' torso, arms and hands; he struggles to close his gauntleted fist, and uses the Soul and Power Stones to discover the real Doctor Strange among the many copies, blowing the duplicates away and sending the singular Doctor Strange reeling. Reality and Space pull Doctor Strange forward, Thanos grasping him by the throat once in range. Doctor Strange grabs futilely at Thanos' hand.]

Thanos: You're full of tricks, wizard.

Stephen Strange: [as Thanos reaches for the Eye of Agamotto] No!

Thanos: [He snaps the Eye off its chain] Yet you never once used your greatest weapon. [He crushes it in his bare hand] A fake. [He throws Doctor Strange hard enough that Doctor Strange's head hits stone and he passes out.]

[Almost simultaneously, a red and gold device slaps into the palm of the Infinity Gauntlet, bracing the fingers open; and a red and gold Avenger makes a fast and hard entrance.]

Tony Stark: [sounding just about done with the Titan] You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna to lose it.

Thanos: Stark.

Tony Stark: You know me?

Thanos: I do. You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.

Tony Stark: My only curse is you. [Small rockets pop out of Iron Man's back and launch at Thanos.]

Thanos: Come on!

[The rockets all explode on target, momentarily shrouding Thanos in smoke. Before it clears, Iron Man pile drives into Thanos horizontally, using his single super-jet boot configuration. As he bounces off, he flips and sticks his landing, immediately re-configuring his boots into ground clamps for stability and his gloves into rocket-driven battering rams, punching Thanos into a ruined wall behind him.]

[Thanos shakes it off quickly, reaches forward and tears Iron Man's helmet off, revealing Tony's surprised expression before the suit recovers automatically and re-forms his head protection. The Titan makes use of the fractional delay and punches back hard, sending Iron Man sliding meters away, giving Thanos time to rip the brace device off the gauntlet. He immediately uses the Power Stone to stream furiously lambent energy at his opponent, who forms a shield to kneel behind just as instantly, getting pushed back even further by the incredible force.]

[Iron Man slides out from behind the shield, letting the angled energy push him away for a faster start, and whips back to Thanos full thrusters; he kicks at the Titan with his left foot, turning the boot into a ground clamp at the same time to pin the gauntlet, and keeps twisting while his left glove becomes a ram again, slamming into Thanos' face, cutting his cheek.]

Thanos: [Panting] All that for a drop of blood.

[He smiles briefly punches Iron Man, sending him pinwheeling, then starts beating him with his fists. Iron Man attempts to block the blows with his forearms, but Thanos is relentless, picking him up by the helmet and blasting his midsection with the Power Stone. The gaps in nanite coverage are now gaping, as the armor loses the ability to recover from the intensity and extent of the damage. Iron Man lands hard from the Power blast, struggles to one knee and fires his right hand repulsor at the inexorable Thanos; the beam is easily deflected by the gauntlet. He gets to both feet as the suit tries to complete repairs, adding the beam from his left hand as well. Thanos walks right up to him, and backhands the incomplete helmet completely off Tony's head. He crosses his arms to block a blow from Thanos' gauntlet, and has his left hand caught over his head. In desperation, he forms what's left of his right glove into a short-sword, which is also easily caught by Thanos, snapping it off clean and driving it through Tony's left side. The fight is over.]

[Thanos walks Tony back until he sits, and places the gauntlet almost comfortingly on Tony's head.]

Thanos: You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive. [He lets go, straightens and steps back] I hope they remember you.

[Tony's just a little distracted with the pain, and blood drooling out of his mouth, and compromised breathing.]

[Thanos raises the gauntlet, closing his fist, all four Stones glowing]

Stephen Strange: Stop! [Sitting up and sounding entirely damaged] Spare his life... and I will give you the stone.

Thanos: No tricks. [Doctor Strange shakes his head as Thanos points all four Stones at him instead.]

Tony Stark: Don't...!

[Doctor Strange reaches up and plucks the Time Stone out of its hiding place in the stars. He opens his hand, the scars on his fingers and their inherent trembling particularly obvious now, and the Stone floats to Thanos' bare hand. Doctor Strange watches him intently, as he takes the Stone and drops it into the thumb setting, the energy pulse making the Titan wince.]

Thanos: One to go. [An energy blast hits the gauntlet right in the empty Mind Stone setting, and Thanos grimaces in surprise.]

Peter Quill: [Screaming in incoherent rage, helmet up, firing with both hands and flying straight for Thanos.]

[Thanos doesn't even bother responding to the assault -- he just leaves. Star-Lord flies through where Thanos had been and crashes, rolling several times]

Peter Quill: [Standing and de-helmeting] Where is he?!

[Tony stitches up his stab wound as well as he can with his suit functions; he has no breath for answers.]

Peter Quill: [Now fearful instead of furious] Did we just lose?

Tony Stark: [To Doctor Strange, sadly, who has given the Time Stone to Thanos] Why would you do that?

Stephen Strange: We're in the Endgame now.

[M'Baka bashes another Outrider -- the ground game has improved considerably with the addition of the God of Thunder. His tribesmen are equally successful around him.]

M'Baku: MAYEFA!

Jabari Warriors: YA HU HU!

[Thor is in the air, using Stormbringer on the Outrider drop ships which are now retreating. He is having considerably more success than the Wakandan Dragon fliers firing on the fleeing ships.]

Wanda Maximoff: [landing as she finally locates Vision] Are you okay? [Vision flinches in pain before he can answer] What? What is it?

Vision: He's here.

[The wind picks up. It feels... strange. Eerie.]

Steve Rogers: Everyone, on my position. We have incoming. [He is joined by the Black Widow, Falcon, Okoye and the Black Panther in short order.]

Natasha Romanoff: What the hell?

Bruce Banner: [Bruce sees the blue-black clouds of a Space Stone relocation just before Thanos steps forward, and confirms this isn't just another member of the Black Order] Cap. That's him.

Steve Rogers: Eyes up. Stay sharp.

[Bruce reaches Thanos first, lunging forward fist-first -- but Thanos uses the Space Stone on him, renders him immaterial until the Hulkbuster is half-buried in the stone of the cliff behind him, and freezes Bruce in place.]

[Captain America is sent flying by purple energy before he even gets to strike a single blow.]

[The Black Panther, armor fully charged kinetically, leaps high and with claws extended, but is easily grabbed by the throat and punched to the ground, his armor discharging violently.]

[Falcon stoops, strafing with both Steyr pistols, but is felled when his wings become rubbery and unable to sustain flight.]

Vision: Wanda. It's time.

Wanda Maximoff: No.

Vision: They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone.

Wanda Maximoff: Don't.

Vision: You must do it. Wanda, please. We. Are. Out of time.

Wanda Maximoff: I can't.

Vision: Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.

Wanda Maximoff: It's not fair.

Vision: It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me. I just... feel you. [The Scarlet Witch extends a trembling hand and starts beaming her energy at the Mind Stone.]

[The following action is mostly muted. War Machine joins the fight, firing his guns at Thanos until he uses the gauntlet to crush his armor around him and toss him aside.]

[The Winter Soldier runs in firing, and is punched away by the Power Stone.]

[Okoye activates the Vibranium-powered elements on her spear and flings it; Power stops it inches from Thanos, and throws her and it aside while wrapping the Black Widow in inescapable bands of earth.]

[Groot stabs his hands into the ground to wrap Thanos in cables of roots, which he breaks easily.]

[The Scarlet Witch watches all this over one shoulder, and turns back to Vision to add her left hand to her tearful effort.]

[Captain America slides under one blow and comes up swinging his deployed arm-shields, punching Thanos in the gut and chin. He grabs the gauntlet, keeping Thanos' fingers un-clenched. Thanos looks very briefly impressed at Captain America's efforts as he screams before slamming a fist into his head and rendering him insensible.]

[The Scarlet Witch looks over her shoulder again and sees Thanos approaching unopposed. She swings her left hand around to fend him off with a stream of scarlet energy, and pushes him back despite his blue-purple energy shield, but then he starts to make slow headway.]

Vision: [Very softly] It's all right. It's all right. I love you.

[At those words, the yellow Mind Stone finally starts to crack. Vision's face is overcome by an expression of joyful peace, and as the crystal fragments completely, a pulse of pure yellow energy explodes from him, shuddering the trees for many meters around his epicenter. Wanda's and Thanos' energy subsides.]

Thanos: [Walking closer to the Scarlet Witch] I understand, my child. Better than anyone.

Wanda Maximoff: [Snarls] You could never.

Thanos: [Reaches down to presume to stroke her hair, as if in comfort] Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now... is no time at all. [He reaches forward, clenching the gauntlet, emerald filigree surrounding his wrist, making a gesture very similar to that Doctor Strange made when activating the Eye of Agamotto. In response, a bead of yellow light starts gathering in on itself as time is reversed and growing in size, solidifying into an intact and conscious Vision]

Wanda Maximoff: No! [She lunges for Vision and is swatted away.]

[Thanos picks up Vision by the throat, lifting him to eye-level, and digs the fingers of his right hand into Vision's forehead, digging out the Mind Stone. He pulls it loose, and Vision goes limp and colorless; he tosses the lifeless android aside like trash. Bringing his gauntleted hand up, he slowly moves the Mind Stone over the last empty setting, and drops it in. The energy surge is much more than any previous -- his torso is wreathed with iridescent static and he bellows from the sensations.]

[As Thanos studies the completed gauntlet, a massive bolt of lighting strikes him, digging him into the ground and grinding him back for meters. Thor has arrived, eyes glowing with power, stooping down from the sky like a bird of prey. The God of Thunder pauses his attack, reverses his position, raises Stormbreaker above his head and hurls it -- Thanos fires the whole might of the gauntlet against it, but it only creates a rainbow-like bow-shock, not slowing the ax as it slams right into Thanos' chest. ]

Thor: [Lands in front of Thanos, who is down on one knee; hatefully.] I told you. You'd die for that! [reffering to the deaths of Loki and Heimdall]

[He takes hold of the back of Thanos' head and forces Stormbreaker deeper into his chest, staring angrily into his eyes while Thanos cries out in pain]

Thanos: [Weakly] You should have... you... [suddenly stronger] You should have gone for the head! [He raises his gauntlet and snaps his fingers.]

Thor: NO!

[The scene whites out. It cuts sharply to a view of Thanos his hand on his chest, no wounds visible. Thanos now seems to be inside the Soul Stone, where he sees a child and the pavilion from the home world of the Zen-Whoberi.]

Thanos: Daughter?

[the child turns around revealing to be Young Gamora.]

Gamora: Did you do it?

Thanos: Yes.

Gamora: [Beat] What did it cost?

Thanos: [Solemnly] Everything.

[Now out of the Soul World, Thanos is snapped back to normal reality, and notices the damage inflicted on the gauntlet -- the metal scorched and distorted from heat, the stones no longer glowing.]

Thor: What'd you do? [Angrily] WHAT'D YOU DO?!

[Thanos nearly seems to not notice Thor before he uses the Space Stone and teleports away, leaving Stormbreaker behind on Wakandan ground.]

Steve Rogers: [Stumbles into the clearing, holding his left side] Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?

Bucky Barnes: Steve?

[Bucky suddenly stumbles over, drops his gun and collapses into ashes, much to Steve's shock; he walks over and touches the ground where Bucky's ashes evaporated disbelievingly.]

[On the battlefield, Wakandan soldiers disintegrate to ashes, much to M'Baku's horror.]

T'Challa: [While reaching for a fallen Okoye] Up, General. Up! This is no place to die. [King T'Challa holds out his hand for Okoye. He suddenly disintegrates into ashes and, in anguish, Okoye falls back on the ground. Few seconds later, she gets up herself.]

Okoye: Kumkani?!

Groot: [Slowly corrodes into ashes as well by Rocket] I am Groot... [TRANSLATION: "Dad?"]

[off-screen Okoye repeats herself]

Rocket: No... no. No. No. No! Groot, no...

[Wanda is mourning over Vision. She then turns into ashes. An injured Sam turns to ashes, hidden in the undergrowth.]

James Rhodes: [Searching for Sam, missing him by only a few feet] Sam? [Back to Okoye is is whimpering for her disintegrated king] Sam, where you at?!

[On Titan, the remaining members of the Guardians and Avengers collect themselves -- Mantis props up Star-Lord, Spider-Man helps Tony to his feet, Drax and Nebula manage to limp over on their own.]

Mantis: Something's happening. [She disintegrates into ashes.]

[Quill looks behind him as he sees Drax disintegrate]

Drax: [To Quill as he dissolves] Quill?

[Quill stares in horror as he turns back to Stark.]

Tony Stark: [Staring panicked at the slowly fading Quill] Steady, Quill.

Peter Quill: Aw, man. [Quill also gets disintegrated into ashes]

Stephen Strange: [Calmly turns to Stark] Tony, there was no other way. [He finally gets erased.]

Peter Parker: [Realizes he's fading away] Mr. Stark? [Stark stares horrified at Parker,] I don't feel so good...

Tony Stark: [Trying to be calm, his voice shaking as he looks at Peter in terror] You're all right?

Peter Parker: [Stumbling and terrified] I don't know what's -- I don't know what's happening. I don't-- [Parker falls into Stark's arms, clutching him tight while beginning to cry.] I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, Mr. Stark, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go... [There is a short silence before Peter speaks again] I'm sorry. [Parker disintegrates into ashes in Stark's arms.]

[Tony falls forward from the lack of weight in his arms, before staring at his hands in disbelief.]

Nebula: [To Tony Stark, seeing Thanos' victory.] He did it.

[Stark mourns silently at their failure. Back on Wakanda, the remaining team members, Captain America, Thor, War Machine, Black Widow, Bruce Banner, and Rocket are left mourning near Vision's dead body. Captain America turns over Vision's bleached corpse as Black Widow runs up to the other survivors.]

James Rhodes: What is this? What the hell is happening?

Steve Rogers: [Pause] Oh, God.

[Meanwhile, in a different place, in a rustic house on a terraced slope with a scarecrow made of discarded armor, Thanos sits down and watches the sun rise.]

[In the mid-credits scene, nothing is shown. But 2 voices are heard.]

Nick Fury: Still no word from Stark?

Maria Hill: No, not yet. We're watching every satellite in both hemispheres, there's still nothing. [Receives three beeps from her device.]

[The screen now shows Nick Fury and Maria Hill on Earth, driving in a car.]

Nick Fury: What is it?

Maria Hill: Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.

Nick Fury: Same energy signatures as New York?

Maria Hill: Ten times bigger.

Nick Fury: Tell Klein. We'll meet him at- -

Maria Hill: [warning] Nick, Nick! [A car spirals out of control in front of them. They get out and Hill checks on the passengers.]

Nick Fury: They okay?

[Behind their vehicle, a motorcycle lies in the middle of the street with a concerned citizen approaching it.]

Maria Hill: There's no one here.

[They hear helicopter rotor sounds from the direction they'd come, but it sounds wrong -- a Leonardo executive helicopter, tail rotor smoking from damage already, appears and crashes nose-first into a building. Screaming intensifies. The two are now witnessing civilians around them suddenly disintegrating.]

Nick Fury: Call Control. Code Red.

Maria Hill: [looks at her hands] Nick?

[Fury turns around to see Hill disintegrating.]

Nick Fury: Hill?

[Fury then races back to their car and gets a what appears to be an old pager with extra gear attached out of his bag on the back seat. He sends out an emergency alert, mere seconds before his hand turns into ashes.]

Nick Fury: Oh, no. Motherf--

[Before he could finish the line, Fury corrodes to dust. The pager falls to the ground, red lights blinking on the additions; the camera zooms in and we see the device display "SENDING..." then display a red-blue-and-gold star insignia -- the symbol of Captain Marvel.] [Cut to black.]

Three Airmen, kids with battle-worn faces.  Crammed in there 
with them is a Man in an expensive suit, who looks tele-
ported from Beverly Hills. 

He is, of course, genius inventor and billionaire, TONY 
STARK.  In his hand is a drink tumbler of vodka.

TONY
Oh, I get it.  You guys aren’t 
allowed to talk.  Is that it?  Are 
you not allowed to talk?

One Airman grins, fidgeting with his orange NY Mets watch. 

JIMMY
No.  We’re allowed to talk.

TONY
Oh.  I see.  So it’s personal.

RAMIREZ
I think they’re intimidated.

TONY
Good God, you’re a woman.

The others try to compress laughs.

TONY (CONT'D)
I, honestly, I couldn’t have called 
that.
(after silence)
I would apologize, but isn’t that 
what we’re going for here? I saw 
you as a soldier first.

JIMMY
I have a question, sir.

TONY
Please.

JIMMY
Is it true you’re twelve for twelve  
with last years Maxim cover girls?

TONY
Excellent question. Yes and no.  
March and I had a schedule conflict 
but, thankfully, the Christmas 
cover was twins.  Anyone else?  
You, with the hand up.

PRATT
It’s a little embarrassing.

TONY
Join the club.

PRATT
Can I take a picture with you?

TONY
Are you aware that Native Americans 
believe photographs steal a little 
piece of your soul?
(then)
Not to worry, mine’s long gone.  
Fire away.

Pratt, excited, poses as another Airman snaps the photo.  A 
second later --

A MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks them.  Through the windshield, the 
Humvee ahead of them erupts in a fireball.

Tony is flung aside, and in the side-mirror --

The Humvee behind them EXPLODES.  Pandemonium as --  

The Airmen are instantly in battle mode.  They scramble out, 
shutting Tony inside.

Tony snaps awake.  He’s tied to a chair, bloody rags covering

A line of armed hooded men and a banner showing ten

President Roosevelt declares the 
United States will build fifty

of Hirohito and Hitler--

S.S. Officers goose-step through Paris.

NARRATOR
Although no such capacity to build 
existed...

1940s L.A., an unassuming hangar reads: “STARK INDUSTRIES.”

NARRATOR
Howard Stark, founder of the 
fledgling Stark Industries, answers 
his call to duty --

A Young Howard Stark shakes FDR’s hand.

NARRATOR
And builds not fifty, but a hundred 
thousand planes.

An airfield covered in B-29s.  Stark bombers in flight, 
strewing bombs and paratroopers across the sky.

Later, Stark’s work on the 
Manhattan project makes the end of 
the war possible.  

A mushroom cloud in the New Mexico desert.  Howard Stark

Stark Industries would go on to 
contribute to every major weapons 
system through the Cold War --

Korean War, B-52s, ICBMS, nuclear subs, F-16s launching from

NARRATOR
But Howard Stark’s greatest 
achievement would come in 1973--

President Ford, holding baby Tony, posing with Howard.  Four

From early on, it was clear that 
Tony Stark had a unique gift--

Tony working on TURBINE ENGINES in a hangar full of F-18s.

At seventeen he graduated summa cum

tragedy would pass the Stark mantle 
from father to son--

Howard’s funeral.  Tony with Reagan, Bush Sr. and Clinton.

NARRATOR
The loss of a titan.  But Tony did 
not let personal grief distract him

NARRATOR
At twenty-one, he became the 
youngest-ever CEO of a Fortune 500 
company.  And with it came a new

A laser-guided bomb hits its target.  

NARRATOR
Smarter weapons, fewer casualties.  
A dedication to preserving life.   

A visual crescendo of America’s modern military might.

NARRATOR
Today Tony Stark’s ingenuity 
continues to protect freedom and 
American interest around the globe.

A waving American flag superimposed with an Annie Liebowitz

As Program Manager and Liaison to 
Stark Industries, I’ve had the 
honor of serving with a real 
patriot, a man whose life has been 
dedicated to protecting our troops 
on the front lines.  He’s a friend. 
And a great mentor.  A man who has 
always been there for his friends 
and his country.  Ladies and 
gentlemen, this year’s ARES Award 
winner -- Mr. Tony Stark.  

THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE. A spotlight fixes on Tony Stark -- or 
rather -- his empty chair.  Applause wanes, lights fade up --

Military brass, politicians, movers and shakers.  Heads 
swivel and MURMUR -- where’s Tony?

OBADIAH STANE (50s), CFO of Stark Industries, regards the 
empty chair.  He makes his way to the podium.  Awkward.  

OBADIAH
Thank you...I, uhhh, I’m not Tony 
Stark, but if I were Tony, I’d tell 
you how honored I am and...what a 
joy it is to receive this award.

Hold on a second --

He rolls again.  The table is hot.  More cheers.

TONY

RHODEY
Yeah.  They said you’d be deeply 
honored if I presented.

Okay, let’s do it.  

Rhodey plops the ARES statue down on the felt.

TONY
That was quick.  Thought there’d be

The Boxman racks up Tony’s chips.

He’s handed racks of chips, then tips the table Operators and

People gawk, snap photos of Tony with their phones.

their name on that award.  

TONY
It belongs to my old man.  They 
should have given it to him.  

RHODEY
What’s wrong with you?  A thousand 
people came here tonight to honor 
you, and you leave them with egg on 
their face.  This award means 
something, Tony, it’s bigger than 
you --

TONY
Hold that thought a sec.

He’s stopped in front of a roulette wheel.  Puts all his 
chips down on, nods to wheel operator.

TONY
Put it all on black.  Don’t worry --

The Wheel Operator spins --

This is no joke.  You’re going into

The Bathroom door swings open and VIRGINIA “PEPPER” POTTS

PEPPER
Tony, it’s the President.  Wants to 
congratulate you personally.  Heads

She tosses the cellphone over the top of the stall.  All very

Yeah, sitting on top of the world

Tony turns, spots CHRISTINE EVERHART, a hot young Reporter 
holding a recorder.  Security keeps her at bay.

CHRISTINE
Christine Everhart, Vanity Fair 
Magazine.  Can I ask you a few 
questions?

TONY
Can I ask a few back?

She gives him a disarming smile.  Tony waves at Security to 
let her through.  Pepper shakes her head, then takes a call.

CHRISTINE
You’ve been described as a Da Vinci

Ridiculous.  I don’t paint. 

CHRISTINE

CHRISTINE
I’m sorry, “Tony”, I was hoping for

TONY
Here’s serious: my old man had a 
philosophy: peace means having a 
bigger stick than the other guy.

CHRISTINE
Good line, coming from the guy 
selling the sticks.  

TONY
My father helped defeat Hitler.  He 
was on the Manhattan Project.  A 
lot of people -- including your 
professors at Brown -- might call 
that being a hero. 

CHRISTINE

Tony has to smile, this gal is relentless.

Tell me: do you plan to report on 
the millions we’ve saved by 
advancing medical technology?  Or

CLOSE ON - TONY: the hood is yanked off his head.  He squints 
into the stinging daylight, his expression turning to shock.  

In a bowl of tall mountains, camouflaged tarps are furled, 
revealing skids upon skids of Stark Industries weapons dating 
back to 80s Afghanistan.

VARIOUS SHOTS - OF CRATES: the STARK INTERNATIONAL MUNITIONS 
logos.  Some faded, some new.

Tony, stunned, staggers along the crates.  Yinsen follows.

an Army surplus blanket.  Yinsen looms over him.

YINSEN
I’m sure they’re looking for you, 
Stark, but they will never find you

running out...and they won’t turn

either when those weapons destroyed 
my village. (beat) What you just 
saw, that’s your legacy -- your

to go out?  Is this the last act of 
defiance of the great Tony Stark? 
Or are you going to try to do

Raza, in the intersecting tunnel, calmly loading another RPG.

Tony primes his flame throwers, but they malfunction.  Both 
men square off.  Raza aims, but now Tony’s flame throwers 
kick in and --

Raza flattens as twin-plumes of fire envelope him.  He 
SCREAMS, grabbing a dead soldiers as a shield.

Tony turns clearing Insurgents out of the tunnels with his 
flame throwers.  Then he returns to Yinsen.

Raza’s men fleeing as a deluge of flame shoots from the

Tony emerges, the gray armor scarred and sizzling.  
Insurgents keep firing, trying to draw him from -- 

The massive ammo dump under the camouflage.  But Tony is 
relentless, keeps moving towards it.  

Tony turns his flame throwers on the crates.  They begin to 
burn -- the STARK logos eaten by flames.  And now --

A withering barrage of gunfire knocks Tony to his knees.  The 
hose to his flame thrower is pierced, setting his arm on 
fire.  Another bullet catches a seam and enters his shoulder.  

But Tony struggles back to his feet.  The suit GRINDS.  He 
pushes further into the maze, torching everything.   

More gunfire pings and ricochets off him, pieces of the gray 
armor begins to come loose.  Now --   

Tony opens a metal flap on his arm, flips a red switch.  And 
now something incredible happens -- 

A WHINE builds to a ROAR.  Tony tucks, angles forward as --

Heel-boosters glow white hot, kicking up desert plumes -- and 
then he blasts off like a missile, rising hundreds of feet.

One Insurgent watches dumbstruck, as Tony arcs across the sky 
towards a mountain pass.  And then -- 

The first ammo dump ignites.  Then another and another, fire 
roses joining in a hellish conflagration.  And barely

Tony is pensive, then the floodgates open.

The system is broken -- there’s no

weaponry worldwide.   

Now the room is in chaos.  Obadiah’s ready to wrap this up,

That’s great.  Get me the design as

Tony’s suit is now comprised of a stabilizer belt, partially-
chromed propulsion boots and the Mark II gauntlets. 
Everything connected by tubing and wires -- he looks like a 
crazy science experiment. 

Tony fires up the boots, hovers.  Then he fires the gloves to 
stabilize.  Weaving, tilting.  He “surfs” mid-air, trying to 
maintain balance, slowly getting the hang of it.  

Then he ventures forward, moving along the expanse of the 
lab.  Dodging pieces of equipment, his car collection, a few 
near misses -- but he maintains control.  Debris and objects 
are blown from tables from the propulsive force.  

The joy of flight.

arms, “stretching”, getting the feel for his new body.  

The helmet -- its intrepid, steely gaze boring into us.

Now we see the full-on Mark II suit, its seams and rivets 
still visible.  The suit HUMS as it powers up.

Standby for calibration.

The gauntlets and boots fire up, and Tony rises.  Suddenly--

He loses balance, falls back onto the hood of his Saleen,

A classy band and polite dancing.  We TRACK IN on Tony at the 
bar, passing Patrons whispering and flicking glances.

MAN (O.S.)
Mr. Stark.

He turns to find Phil Coulson -- all business.

COULSON
Agent Coulson.

TONY
Oh...was I supposed to meet you 
here?

COULSON
No, but you haven’t been returning 
my calls.  This is serious, we need 
to get something on the books or 
I’ll have to go official on you.

Tony sees Pepper coming down the stairs.  She looks stunning 
in a classic gown.

TONY
Yes, you’re right.  I’m going to 
handle this right now.  Let me 
check with my assistant.

Tony beelines for Pepper.  She’s surprised to see him.

TONY
Miss Potts -- can I have five 
minutes?  You look...you look like 
should always wear that dress.

PEPPER
Thanks.  It was a birthday present-- 
from you.

TONY
I have great taste.   Care to 
dance?

Tony takes her hand and whisks her onto the dance floor.

Tony and Pepper dance, looking good together.  Natural.

TONY
I’m sorry.  Am I making you 
uncomfortable?  You seem very 
uncomfortable.

PEPPER
No, I always forget to wear 
deodorant and dance with my boss in 
front of everyone I’ve ever worked 
with in a chiffon dress.

TONY
Would it help if I fired you?

PEPPER
You wouldn’t last a week without 
me.

Tony and Pepper under the stars, close together.

PEPPER
I’m sorry I was so uncomfortable.  
I hate being the center of 
attention like that and that’s why 
this one time in high school when I 
was supposed to be in a play... no, 
never mind... but you know that’s 
why I never like, wanted to have a 
big wedding... you know, because I 
thought everyone would be looking 
at me wearing a dress.  Oh, no, 
no... I’m not saying, like,  
“wedding.”  No, not like that.  I’m 
just saying, you know...

He plants one on her.  She gets quiet.  They both do.  
Then...

TONY
Can I get you another glass of 
wine?

PEPPER
A vodka martini, extra dry, with 
extra olives as soon as possible.

TONY
Okay.

He goes, then is stopped.

PEPPER
And, Tony...

TONY

PEPPER
I’m not a cheeseburger.

TONY

No.  You’re not a cheeseburger.

The party going full tilt.  Tony takes two drinks from the 
Bartender.  Turns to find himself face-to-face with --

The reporter, Christine. The one-night stand he can’t escape.

CHRISTINE
Mr. Stark! I was hoping I could get 
a reaction from you.

TONY
How’s panic?

CHRISTINE
I was referring to your company’s 
involvement in this latest 
atrocity. 

TONY
Hey, they just put my name on the 
invitations --

She thrusts a dossier of photos out to him.  

CHRISTINE
Is this what you call 
accountability?   

He looks at the photos, going stone-faced.

TONY
When were these taken?

CHRISTINE
Yesterday.  Good P.R. move, you 
tell the world you’re a changed 
man, even I believed you.  

THE PHOTOS: victorious insurgents, the Ten Rings insignia on 
their vehicles, clutch Stark machine guns, RPGs.  Behind, a 
town burns, bodies strewn.    

A photo of civilians being marched in rows, pre-execution, 
Stark weapons trained at their backs.

TONY
I didn’t approve this shipment.

Tony strides out to the red-carpet paparazzi.

TONY
I made some promises I’m not going 
to be able to keep.  I suggest you 
pull all your money out of Stark 
Industries immediately --

Obadiah is suddenly there, steering Tony up the entrance 
stairs.

OBADIAH
Is this like a tick for you?  
Whenever you have a feeling, you 
start going to all the people who 
don’t trust you, who don’t protect 
you.  They’re going to put a spin 
on everything you say.

TONY
Wait a minute.  I got to ask you 
something.   I’m dead serious about 
this.  I’m not kidding.  Am I 
losing my mind or is Pepper really 
cute?  Do you think she’s 
attractive and interesting, or is 
it just that her hair is down?  
I’ve been out of the game for a 
while.

OBADIAH
Are you out of your mind.  You’re 
messing with the “guys in the 
rooms”, we’re talking about billion 
dollar interests, the world order --  

TONY
I’m not worried about that right 
now --

OBADIAH
-- you should be.  You’ll 
disappear.  I can’t protect you 
against people like that --?

OBADIAH
Tony don’t be so naive --

TONY
-- naive?  I was naive before, when 
I was growing up and they told me 
don’t ever cross this line, this is 
how we do business.  In the 
meantime we’re double-dealing under 
the table.  We don’t even deserve 
to represent the United States --

OBADIAH
 -- Tony, you’re a child --! 

TONY
-- you don’t believe I can turn 
this company around, do you --?

OBADIAH
-- you’ve got about as much control 
over things as a child riding in 
the backseat of your father’s car 
with a red plastic steering wheel 
in your hand. 

TONY
Maybe I’ll just get out of the car.

OBADIAH
You’re not even allowed in the car. 
(then) I’m the one who’s filing the 
injunction against you.

Tony is shell-shocked.  Then, he goes after Obadiah.  They 
jostle and Obadiah backs off as Tony goes ballistic.  The 
paparazzi snap photos.

OBADIAH
It’s the only way I could protect 
you.

Aki (from earlier) and several Obadiah’s Men, smiling, but 
steely-eyed, step in to  prevent Tony from following Obadiah 
to his waiting car.

INT.  TONY’S WORKSHOP - NIGHT
107
107

Tony, wearing a Mark III gauntlet, wired to his RT chest-
piece, turns a screwdriver to adjust the power.  

On the wall beside him --

A flatscreen TV: live war footage, refugees huddled.  The 
bottom crawl reads, “BREAKING NEWS - TRAGEDY IN GULMIRA.”

TV REPORTER’S VOICE
-- the ten mile drive to the 
outskirts of Gulmira can only be 
described as a descent into Hell, 
into a modern-day Heart of 
Darkness.  Simple farmers and 
herders, from peaceful villages, 
driven from their homes at the butt 
of Western rifles and the turrets 
of modern tanks.  Displaced from 
their lands by Warlords and 
insurgent groups emboldened by 
their newfound power -- a power 
fueled by high-tech weapons easily 
purchased with Poppy money on the 
black market -- and further 
destabilizing a fragile region 
which for decades has been a 
tinderbox of tribal feuding and 
ethnic hatred --

Tony aims the gauntlet at some light fixtures.  Gives them an 
RT blast.  They spark and fall from the ceiling.  

TV REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
The villagers have taken shelter in 
whatever crude dwellings they can 
find -- in the ruins of other razed 
villages, in the cold barren 
scrublands, or in the remnants of 
an old Soviet smelting plant.  Our 
translator relayed to us one human 
tragedy after another.  A seven 
year old boy, thin as a scarecrow, 
clutching yellowed photographs and 
holding them out to anyone who 
would stop, with a child’s simple 
question: where are my mother and 
father?  A woman, begging for news 
of her husband, who’d been 
kidnapped by insurgents -- either 
forced to join their militia, or to 
be shot without reason --

Tony adjusts the gauntlet again, raising the power level.  
Blasts a window in the lab, shattering the glass and knocking 
a painting off the wall.  

TV REPORTER’S VOICE (CONT’D)
With no political will or 
international pressure, there is 
little hope for these newly-formed 
refugees.  Refugees who can only 
wonder one thing: is the world 
watching?

A final adjustment.  Another RT blast -- this time Tony wipes 
out the plasma TV screen.

Pepper enters, regards the destruction, the massive hole in

A mortar explodes in our face.  Smoke drifts away revealing --

A terrified MOTHER and her FOUR KIDS huddled in a cave-like 
crawlspace.  She doesn’t have enough arms to cover them all.

THEIR POV - OF ‘ALLEY’ OUTSIDE: an abandoned industrial 
facility.  GUNFIRE, SCREAMING.  In the distance --

Ragged tents and shanties are beset upon by black clad 
Irregular Forces, firing and burning and destroying.

Soldiers toss grenades into rat holes.  Hunter-killer teams 
fire at offscreen targets -- then smile with satisfaction.

The oldest of the four kids in the crawlspace darts out into 
the alley, frantically calling -- 

KID
Arto!  ARTO!

On his way back he’s surprised by a four man hunter-killer 
team.  They shout at him to drop the puppy, but he won’t. 

The men cock their guns, briefly distracted by a strange 
rocket-streak in the sky.  Never mind, they take aim on the 
boy, and are about to fire when --

IRON MAN lands before them, slamming his fist to the ground 
in the classic Granov fist smash.  With a single RT blast -- 

The Soldiers are thrown fifty yards.  Tony scoops up the Kid, 
with the barking mutt in his arms, and they take off. 

NEW ANGLE - CRAWLSPACE

Iron Man drops down, delivering Kid and dog back to safety.  
The Kid, ignoring his mother’s protests, darts back out to 
watch Iron Man.  He sees --

A Soldier flying like a ragdoll from behind a heap of bricks.

to a cluster of militants with his fists and bursts of RT.

Refugees slowly emerge from their cover, stunned to watch 
Soldiers retreating in fear.

Raza, his wounds healed like papier-mâché, observing his 
retreating men from a command post.  He grabs a rifle, steps 
through a building, and spots -- 

Iron Man, in the distance, throwing a Soldier through a wall.

Raza scrunches into nook, riveted.

Picks a Soldier up, who’s about to fire an RPG.  Holds an RT 
palm to the man’s face.

Iron Man -- clinging to the underside of one of the Raptors.  

VIPER 1 (O.S.)
Viper 2 -- he’s on your belly! 
Shake him!

VIPER 2 (O.S.)
What--?

CUT TO:

CONTROL ROOM

ALLEN’s eyes go wide at the belly-cam images.  The Iron suit 
hangs on for dear life as the Raptor tries to shake it.  

VIPER 1 (O.S.)
Ballroom: that is definitely not a 
UAV.

MAJOR ALLEN
What is it then?  

VIPER 1 (O.S.)
I think it’s...a Man, sir.  

PUSH IN: on Rhodey, as all the pieces click.

RHODEY
Son of a bitch. (then)  Tony--! 

But the line is dead. 

CUT TO:

Viper 2, frantic, looking out both sides of the cockpit, 
trying to spy Iron Man, shaking the jet harder. 

VIPER 1 (O.S.)
Still there Viper 2.  ROLL!  ROLL!

Viper 2 works the stick, world becoming a centrifugal blur.

Viper 2 engages in dangerous rolls.  The horizon spins as 
Iron Man clings desperately for life.  

CUT TO:

INSIDE SUIT: BUZZERS. WARNING LIGHTS FLASH:  “POWER 28%”.

JARVIS (O.S.)
Sir: two minutes and there won’t be

CUT TO:

Finally, Tony is jarred loose, tumbling and --

Hits Viper 1’s tail-fin, shearing it off.  The jet careens 
out of control.

VIPER 1 (O.S.)
I’M HIT!

CUT TO:

Inside Viper 1’s Raptor, spiraling crazily.

Viper 1 pulls his EJECT and blasts out of the crippled jet.

CUT TO:

The sky, as we fall with Viper 1, his chute failing to open 
as he pulls the damaged lever.  

And he continues plunging, Earth and sky revolving like one.  

MAJOR ALLEN (O.S.)
Viper 2, do you see a chute?

VIPER 2 (O.S.)
Negative!  No chute, no chute--

But Tony dives, vortices curling off his feet as he pursues 
the tumbling pilot.

VIPER 2 (O.S.)
The UAV is going after him!  It’s 
attacking--!

CUT TO:

Iron Man reaches the pilot, and they are face to face a split 
second, before he yanks the chute mechanism free and --

The chute snaps open, yanking the pilot up and out of view.

VIPER 2 (O.S.)
GOOD CHUTE!  GOOD CHUTE!  You’re 
not gonna believe this, Ballroom... 
but that thing just saved his ass.  

Iron Man banks sharply, coming dangerously close to the 
ground.   Viper 2 barrel-rolls onto his tail. 

CUT TO:

Rhodey and Major ALLEN are glued to the SCREENS.   

MAJOR ALLEN
Viper 2: re-engage.  

RHODEY
-- WAIT --!

MAJOR ALLEN

RHODEY
Major, call off that Raptor.  You

MAJOR ALLEN
It’s not your call.  That thing 
just took out an F-22 inside a 
legal no-fly zone (then)  Viper 2: 
you get a clean shot you take it.  

Rhodey’s eyes are locked on the screens.  

CUT TO:

Viper 2 fires its missile.  It races towards Iron Man.  
Evasive maneuvers, chaff released.  Then the explosion -- way 
too close for comfort.  Iron Man is thrown from the frame by 
the fireball.

CUT TO:

Iron Man’s “dot” vanishes from the screens.  

MAJOR ALLEN
Viper 2.  Can you confirm the kill?

VIPER 2 (O.S.)
I got him good.  He went down, he 
was smokin’.  But I cannot confirm.

RAZA
His escape bore unexpected fruit.  

OBADIAH
(as it dawns on him)
...so this is how he did it.

RAZA
This is only a crude first effort.  
But he’s perfected his design-- 

Raza hands grainy surveillance photos to Stane.    

CLOSE ON - VARIOUS PHOTOS: Iron Man wreaking havoc in 
Gulmira.

Stane has seen the future.  Then he looks down at -- 

Tony’s crusty laptop.  The onion-skin schematics.     

OBADIAH
What’s this?

RAZA
The inside of Tony Stark’s mind. 

Raza arranges the schematics on a light board, and the 
sketches laid together become...Iron Man.

RAZA
Everything you will need to build 
this weapon.  

Obadiah is circling the armor now, taking it all in.  Raza 
sits and pours tea.  

RAZA
Stark has made a masterpiece of 
death.  A man with a dozen of these 
could rule from the Pacific to the 
Ukraine.  And you dream of Stark’s 
throne -- we have a common enemy.  

Now Stane pokes at the vacant hole in the chest plate.

Obadiah smiles, places his hands on Raza’s shoulders, as if 
going to hug him in brotherhood.  

OBADIAH
(in perfect Urdu)
This...is the only gift you shall 
receive. 

Raza is strangely confused.  Paralyzed.  Blood begins running 
from his ear.

And now, in Obadiah’s hand, we realize he’s holding a device.  
A sonic taser.  

Obadiah removes a pair of filtering ear-plugs as Raza 
crumples to the dirt.  

OBADIAH
Technology -- (holds up the taser) 
it’s always been your Achilles 
Heel.  Don’t worry, it’ll wear off 
in fifteen minutes -- but that’s

A grainy video clip opens: Tony, half-dead, tied to a chair.

A SCREEN: listing six messages, all the same: “MISSED CALL - 
PEPPER.”

Suddenly, the CNC machine powers down unexpectedly.

You have a visitor, Sir.  Obadiah 
Stane is here.

Obadiah holds a pizza.

OBADIAH
It’s UNOS.  Four cheese.  I just 
had it flown in from Chicago.  

Tony remains stoic.  Obadiah puts the pizza down, crosses to 
Tony and hands him a letter.  

OBADIAH
I’d like you to proof-read 
something for me.  

JARVIS (O.S.)
Would you like me to spell-check 
it, Sir?

OBADIAH
Can you turn him off?  All the way?

TONY
(as he scans the letter)
Spin down Jarvis. 

Tony looks up from the letter, surprised.  

TONY
Your resignation. 

OBADIAH
You were right.  It’s not my 
company -- not my name on the 
building.

Tony hears a blip from the phone system.

“INCOMING.  PEPPER POTTS” appears. 

Tony looks to Obadiah.

TONY
Pepper.  I should take that.

OBADIAH
Tony.  Please.  I’ll be out of here

Tony finally nods, pushes a button, sending the call to voice

Obadiah meets Tony’s eyes, fatherly.  Puts a hand on Tony’s

ones he wore with Raza. 

Tony sinks back in his chair.  Stane places the sonic taser 
down on the table. 

OBADIAH
Easy, now.  Try to breathe...

He kneels beside Tony.  Unbuttons Tony’s shirt.  

OBADIAH
You can’t mess with progress, Tony.  
It’s an insult to the Gods.  You 
created your greatest weapon ever -- 
but you think that means it belongs 
to you.  It belongs to the world.     

CLOSE ON - TONY’S EYES: wide with pain, unable to move.  All 
he can do is gasp and gurgle as --

Stane begins removing the chest-piece from its socket.

OBADIAH
Your “heart” will be the seed of 
the next generation of weapons.  
They’ll help us steer the world 
back in the right direction -- put 
the balance of power back in our 
hands.  The right hands.

reflecting on his face.  

OBADIAH
By the time you die, my prototype 
will be operational. (smiles)  It’s 
not as conservative as yours.  

He wraps the heart in cloth.  Then stands, clicking off the 
sonic taser and pocketing it.

Tony rolls from the chair, onto his back, staring at the 
ceiling.  Already slipping away.  Then--

The EMP surges outwards, turning Dynamo and Iron Man into 
statues as the pulse knocks out his power and electronics.

FROM UP HIGH: the EMP blast travels concentrically outwards, 
rendering everything dark in its wake.

BACK TO:

The roof, as it sags down in the center.  

Tony, dazed, looks at his heart-device.  It’s dead too.

The Dynamo, closest to the collapsed section of the roof, 
topples over.  Its dead fingers catch on a seam and it lies 
precariously on the edge of the ‘slope’.

The Dynamo hatch opens, revealing Obadiah --

OBADIAH’S POV: through the hole in the roof, the seething 
plasma bubbling below.

Tony, using his own waning strength, tries to extend a dead 
Iron Man hand to Obadiah.

TONY
Take my hand...

OBADIAH
So this is the answer, Tony?  This 
is how you’re going to save the 
world?  It’s not in you.  Your 
father told me before he died, my 
boy doesn’t have a warrior’s heart. 
I should have listened.

TONY
My father never knew me.

OBADIAH
But I do.  

Now we see what Stane is attempting: to manually winch his 
forearm rocket bay open so he can blast Tony.  

But his movements unsettle the Dynamo suit and suddenly he 
begins to slide.

OBADIAH
Goodbye, my boy...

TONY
This is just the beginning.

And now Obadiah shuts the hatch and tumbles away.  He --   

Plunges down through the ARK’s silo -- splashes into the 
plasma which HISSES and swallows him up.

Tony remains, shutting his eyes.

Tony frozen in his dead suit.  He’s not moving.  Two

INT. STARK INDUSTRIES - HALLWAY - MOVING - DAY

Tony and Pepper walk along the hallway.  Pepper shoves a 
written statement into his hands.  

PEPPER
Here, your alibi.  You were on your 
yacht.  I’ve got port papers that 
put you in Avalon all night, and 
sworn statements from fifty of your 
guests.     

TONY
Maybe it was just the two of us.  
On the yacht, I mean.

PEPPER
Focus, please.  

Tony grabs an L.A. Times from the pile of papers in her arms, 
glances at the headline: “WHO IS THE IRON MAN?”  A grainy 
newspaper photo of the iron battle at Stark Industries.

TONY
“Iron Man”.  Not technically 
accurate, since it’s mostly carbon-
fiber and ceramic.  But I like the 
ring of it.  “Iron Man”...  

They turn a corner.  Tony suddenly stops.  Meets her eyes.

TONY
You know...that night at the 
concert hall.  Do you ever think 
about it?

For a moment there is nothing else in the world but the two 
of them.  Then, with a tinge of sadness-- 

PEPPER
I don’t know what you’re talking 
about, Mr. Stark.    

She brings her hands up and fixes his unruly tie knot.  All 
business.  

PEPPER
Will that be all, Mr. Stark?

TONY
That will be all Miss Potts.

INT.  STARK INDUSTRIES LOBBY - MINUTES LATER

Rhodey is in mid-speech, in front of assembled reporters.  

RHODEY
--I can confirm that a series of 
military test-prototypes were 
involved in the incident at Stark 
Industries last night.  I can also 
confirm that there was, for a brief 
time, the danger of an Ark Reactor 
“incident”, which was rectified 
without injury to the public -- and 
all power outages have been 
restored.  Here now, to answer a 
few brief questions, is Tony Stark.   

Tony walks out.  Takes the podium.  Puts a hand up to silence 
the bubbling questions. 

TONY
I’ve seen the papers.  I’ve heard 
the reports.  That’s why I want to 
put an end to all this wild 
speculation.  The truth is--

He looks to Rhodey.  To Pepper.  To the crowd.  

TONY
I am Iron Man.  

The Reporters erupt in a CACOPHONY--   

We end on Tony’s face.

Tony (V.O.): Been a while since I was up here in front of you. Maybe I’ll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards. There’s been some speculation that I was somehow involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and on the rooftop…
Christine Everhart (V.O.): Sorry, Mr Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that convinently appeared despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?
Tony (V.O.): Yes
MOSCOW
Christine (V.O.): And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped with an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle…
Tony (V.O.): I know that it’s confusing. It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I’m a superhero.
Switch to view of a TV
Tony (on TV): I mean, let’s face it, I’m not the heroric type. A laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I’ve made, largely public. The truth is… I am Iron Man.
Anton Vanko [Russian]: Ivan. Vanya. That should be you.
Ivan Vanko [Russian]: Don’t listen to that crap
Anton Vanko [Russian]: I’m sorry. All I can give you is my knowledge.
(Anton coughs and dies. Ivan is naturally distraught. Takes a swig of vodka. Pulls out blueprints for an arc reactor. Engineering montage as opening credits roll.)

STARK EXPO – FLUSHING, NEW YORK.
(Dismantling Iron Man suit.)
Pretty much everyone in the crowd: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!
Tony: It’s good to be back. You missed me?
Man in crowd: Blow something up!
Tony: I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I’m not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I’m not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I’m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven’t come across anyone who’s man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.
Woman in crowd: I love you Tony!
Tony: Please, it’s not about me. [People still cheering Tony] It’s not about you. It’s not even about us. It’s about legacy. It’s about what we choose to leave behind for future generations. And that’s why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future. It’s not about us. Therefore, what I’m saying, if I’m saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo. [Big cheer from crowd.] And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it’s all about, please welcome my father, Howard.
Howard Stark (on a screen, courtesy of a video recording): Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust health, and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. So, from all of us here at Stark Industries, I would like to personally introduce you to the City of the Future. Technology holds infinite possibilities for mankind, [Tony is off the stage, doing something. Blood toxicity test. Gives a reading of 19%. Not good] and will one day rid society of all its ills. Soon technology will affect the way you live your life every day. No more tedious work, leaving more time for leisure activities and enjoying the sweet life. The Stark Expo. Welcome.

[Video ends. Cut to news feed of reporter outside.]
Reporter: We are coming to you live from the kickoff at the Stark Expo, where Tony Stark has just walked offstage. Don’t worry if you can’t make it down here tonight because this Expo goes on all year long. And I’m gonna be here checking out all the attractions and the pavilions and inventions from all around the world.

Happy Hogan: Make sure you join me…

Tony: All right, it’s a zoo out there, watch out.

Happy: Open up, let’s go.

[Image is Tony trying to pass through the crowd, from Tony’s perspective.]

Tony: Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you.

People: Tony, Tony

Tony: Hey, hey.

Woman: Call me.

Happy: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.

Tony: [signing a picture of Iron Man] Hello. It would be a pleasure.

Happy: Okay

Tony: [what would be ruffling the hair of a small boy if said small boy were not wearing an Iron Man helmet making hair unreachable] See you buddy

Happy: This is Larry.

Tony: Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you.

Larry: Call me. Call me.

Happy: Larry King.

Tony: Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people.

Happy: [Scene shows them finally at the door] Come on, Tony. There we go.

Tony: Very mellow.

Happy: That wasn’t so bad.

Tony: No, it was perfect.

Happy: Look what we got here, the new model.

Tony: Hey, does she come with the car?

Happy: I certainly hope so. Hi.

Tony: Hi. And you are?

Woman: Marshal.

Tony: Irish. I like it.

Marshal: Pleased to meet you Tony.

Tony: I’m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?

Marshal: Bedford.

Tony: What are you doing here?

Marshal: Looking for you.

Tony: Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?

Marshal: Serving subpoenas. [Hands him a letter. Tony doesn’t take it]

Tony: Yikes.

Happy: [Reaching over and taking the letter] He doesn’t like to be handed things.

Tony: Yeah, I have a peeve.

Marshal: I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.

Tony: Can I see a badge?

Marshal: You wanna see the badge?

Happy: He likes the badge.

Marshal: [showing him her badge.] You still like it?

Tony: Yep. [Starts engine] How far are we from D.C.?

Happy: D.C.? 250 miles.

[Drive off. Image slides over, like when you used to make Powerpoints with all the transitions. It now shows Washing D.C. You can tell because words appear saying…]

WASHINGTON D.C.

Senator Stern: Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.

Tony: [turns around from where he was trying to talk to Pepper who looks like she was trying to tell him off.] Yes dear?

Senator Stern: Can I have your attention?

Tony: Absolutely.

Stern: Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?

Tony: I do not.

Stern: You do not?

Tony: I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon.

Stern: The Iron Man weapon.

Tony: My device does not fit that description.

Stern: Well… How would you describe it?

Tony: I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.

Stern: As?

Tony: It’s a high-tech prosthesis. That is… That is… That’s actually the most apt description I can make of it.

Stern: It’s a weapon. It’s a weapon, Mr Stark.

Tony: Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen…

Stern: My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.

Tony: Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you’re in. You can’t have it.

Stern: Look, I’m no expert…

Tony: In prostitution? Of course not. You’re a senator. Come on.

[People laugh. He waves. Pepper does not look impressed at all. He mouths “no?” and she shakes her head.]

Stern: I’m no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I’d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.

Tony: Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.

Justin Hammer: Absolutely. I’m no expert. I defer to you, Anthony. You’re the wonder boy. Senator, if I may. I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert? Your dad. Howard Stark. Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age. Let’s just be clear, he was no flower child. He was a lion. We all know why we’re here. In the last six months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities. And yet, he insists it’s a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it. I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do. I’d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain’t Canada. You know, we live in a world of grave threats, threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee. Thank you. God bless Iron Man. God bless America.

Stern: That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.

Tony: Rhodey? What?

[Rhodey walks in, Tony gets up to greet him] \

Tony: Hey, buddy. I didn’t expect to see you here.

Rhodey: Look, it’s me, I’m here. Deal with it. Let’s move on.

Tony: I just…

Rhodey: Drop it.

Tony: All right, I’ll drop it.

Stern: I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon, complied by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record, can you please read page 57, paragraph four?

Rhodey: You’re requesting that I read specific selections from my report, Senator?

Stern: Yes, sir.

Rhodey: It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.

Stern: I understand. A lot of things have changed today. So if you could just read…

Rhodey: You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect the summery of my final…

Stern: Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.

Rhodey: Very well. “As he does not operate within any definable branch of government, Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests.” I did however, go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh three liabilities and that it would be in our interest…

Stern: That’s enough Colonel

Rhodey: …to fold Mr Stark…

Stern: That’s enough

Rhodey: …into the existing chain of command, Senator.

Tony: I’m not a joiner, but I’ll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice.

[Laughs from crowd.]

Tony: We can amend the hours a little bit.

Stern: I’d like to go on and show, if I may, the imagery that’s connected to your report.

Rhodey: I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images to the general public at this time.

Stern: With all due respect, Colonel, I understand. And if you could just narrate those for us, we’d be very grateful. Let’s have the images.

Rhodey: Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark’s suit. This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground…

[Tony is doing something on a Stark device]

Rhodey: … indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.

Tony: Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here. [Sets up his device to connect with the screen showing the pictures.] Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on.

Stern: What is he doing?

Tony: If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that’s North Korea. [Video of a suit. It falls over and clearly doesn’t work very well at all.]

Stern: Can you turn that off? Take it off. [Justin Hammer stands up]

Tony: Iran.

[This suit can fly. For all of five seconds before crashing, judging by the smoke, probably on fire. Justin is by the screen, trying to find the off switch.]

Tony: No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?

[Yep, it’s a video of Justin Hammer. With a suit. Again that really doesn’t work.]

Tony: Justin, you’re on TV. Focus up.

TV Justin: Okay, give me a left twist. Left’s good. Turn to the right. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

[Language Justin]

Tony: [Just as not-TV Justin finds the plug and unplugs the screen] Wow. Yeah, I’d say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty.

Justin: I’d like to point out that that test pilot survived.

Stern: I think we’re done is the point that he’s making. I don’t think there’s any reason…

Tony: The point is, you’re welcome, I guess

Stern: For what?

Tony: Because I’m your nuclear deterrent. It’s working. We’re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can’t have it. But I did you a big favour.

[Stands up and turns around to face the crowd]

Tony: I’ve successfully privatised world peace.

[Both hands make peace signs and everyone stands up, all talking at once]

Tony: What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.

Stern: [beep] you, Mr Stark. [beep] you, buddy. We’re adjourned. We’re adjourned for today.

Tony: [puts on sunglasses. Rhodey’s still sitting down and has the same look on his face as Pepper did. Basically, they’re both tired of Tony not taking serious things seriously] Okay.

Stern: You’ve been a delight.

[Kind of scene change. It’s now on a television on a Russian news channel with Russian dubbing. Because it’s a film where the selected language is English, we can still here the English clearer than the Russian. We’re back to Ivan.]

Tony (on TV): My bond is with the people. And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself. If there’s one thing I’ve proven it’s that you can count on me to pleasure myself.

[Ivan is still working. There’s things going blue. It works. It’s not a full suit, but it does now look like he has whips made of lightning. Scene change. Tony’s house. He’s in his workshop. Pans in from across the ocean]

MALIBU, CALIFORNIA

Tony: Wake up, Daddy’s home.

Jarvis (V.O., A.I): Welcome home, sir. Congratulations on the opening ceremonies. They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing. And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.

[One of the robots is trying to make a smoothie. Without a blender lid]

Tony: You!

[You knocks over the blender. Well, he tried.]

Tony: I swear to God I’ll dismantle you. I’ll soak your motherboard. I’ll turn you into a wine rack.

[You looks down, sad.]

Tony: How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?

Jarvis: We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.

[Tony downs green liquid]

Tony: Check palladium levels.

[Using the same machine as before]

Jarvis: Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted.

Tony: [Takes Arc Reactor out of chest. The core pops out, rusted and slightly smoking.] God, they’re running out quick.

Jarvis: I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core.

[Tony inputs a new core. It’s silver, giving a judgment of just how badly damaged the other one was. Replaces Arc Reactor in chest.]

Jarvis: You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the device that’s keeping you alive is also killing you.

[Which we can see from the image of Tony’s chest on the computer screen. There’s blue lines all around the Arc Reactor. Camera angle shifts to focus on his actual chest.]

Jarvis: Miss Potts is approaching. I recommend that you inform her…

Tony: Mute.

[Shirt back down, computers switched to screen saver, Pepper inputs a code and opens the door]

Pepper: Is this a joke? What are you thinking?

Tony: What?

Pepper: What are you thinking?

Tony: Hey, I’m thinking I’m busy. And you’re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don’t want to get sick.

Pepper: Did you just donate…

Tony: Keep your business.

[Both walking around the room]

Pepper: …our entire modern art collection to the…

Tony: Boy Scouts of America.

Pepper: …Boy Scouts of America?

Tony: Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn’t physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it’s not “our” collection, it’s my collection. No offence.

Pepper: No, you know what? I think I’m actually entitled to say “our” collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that.

Tony: It was a tax write-off. I needed that.

Pepper: You know, there’s only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about.

Tony: [to another robot] Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport’s already machining that part.

Pepper: The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.

Tony: I need you to wear a surgical mask until you’re feeling better. Is that okay?

Pepper: That’s rude.

Tony: There’s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It’s my primary point of concern. I don’t know why you’re…

Pepper: The Expo is your ego gone crazy.

Tony: [Picking up a painting. Of Iron Man] Wow. Look at that. That’s modern art. That’s going up.

Pepper: You’ve got to be kidding.

Tony: I’m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.

Pepper: Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?

Tony: No. Our stocks have never been higher.

Pepper: Yes, from a managerial standpoint.

Tony: You are… Well, if’s messy then let’s double back.

Pepper: Let me give you an example.

Tony: Let’s move onto another subject.

Pepper: No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up.

Tony: I’m not taking it down. I’m just replacing it with this.

[Tony is now stood on a desk about to take down the Barnett Newman to put the Iron Man picture up].

Tony: Let’s see what I can get going on here.

Pepper: Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people.

Tony: Yeah. Don’t say “wind farm.” I’m already feeling gassy.

Pepper: And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll…

Tony: Everything was my idea.

Pepper: …and you won’t make a decision.

Tony: I don’t care about the liberal agenda any more. It’s boring. Boring. I’m giving you a boring alert. [Jumps off desk] You do it.

Pepper: I do what?

Tony: Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.

Pepper: Yeah, I’m trying to run the company.

Tony: Pepper, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it.

Pepper: You will not give me the information…

Tony: I’m not asking you to try…

Pepper: …in order to…

Tony: I’m asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.

Pepper: I am trying to do it.

Tony: Pepper, you’re not listening to me!

Pepper: No, you are not listening to me.

Tony: I’m trying to make you CEO. Why won’t you let me?

Pepper: Have you been drinking?

Tony: Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I’ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not. [One of the robots brings him a tray which a bottle and glasses on it] Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realised it’s you. It’s always been you. [Pours champagne. Pepper sits down, shocked and confused]. I thought there’d be a legal issue, but actually I’m capable of appointing my successor. My successor being you. [Hands her a glass. She doesn’t take it.] Congratulations? Take it, just take it.

Pepper: I don’t know what to think.

Tony: Don’t think, drink. There you go. [They tap glasses and drink]

[We’re back in Russia. A man hands Ivan a letter down a twitten, out of sight. It contains a fake passport and a ticket. Another scene change. Tony and Happy are boxing. Pepper walks in.]

Pepper: The notary’s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?

Tony: I’m on happy time. [Tony hits Happy in the face with his elbow] Sorry.

Happy: What the hell was that?

Tony: It’s called mixed martial arts. It’s been around for three weeks.

Happy: It’s called dirty boxing, there’s nothing new about it

Tony: All right, put them up. Come on. [The Notary walks in. Both Happy and Tony’s attention shifts to her]

Pepper: I promise this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.

Notary: I need you to initial each box.

Happy: [Taps Tony on the back of the head with a light punch, not enough to hurt him] Lesson one. Never take your eye off… [Tony kicks him and he goes crashing into the corner of the ring. Camera angle shifts to Pepper and the Notary and clangs are heard.]

Tony: That’s it. I’m done. What’s your name, lady?

Notary: Rushman. Natalie Rushman [So we shall now refer to the Notary as Natalie]

Tony: Front and centre. Come into the church.

Pepper: No. You’re seriously not gonna ask…

Tony: If it pleases the court, which it does.

Natalie: [To Pepper] It’s no problem.

Pepper: [To Natalie] I’m sorry. He’s very eccentric.

[Natalie enters ring. Tony swigs down more green liquid out of a bottle]

Tony: Can you give her a lesson?

Happy: No problem.

Tony: [Steps out of ring and towards Pepper] Pepper.

Pepper: What?

Tony: [Sitting down next to Pepper] Who is she?

Pepper: She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.

Tony: I need a new assistant, boss.

Pepper: Yes, and I’ve got three excellent potential candidates. They’re lined up and ready to meet you.

Tony: I don’t have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it’s her.

Pepper: No, it’s not.

Happy: You ever boxed before?

Natalie: I have, yes.

Happy: What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that? [Natalie’s face shows brief annoyance at his statement before Tony distracts her]

Tony: How do I spell your name, Natalie?

Natalie: R-U-S-H-M-A-N.

Pepper: What, are you gonna google her now?

Tony: I thought I was ogling her. [Brings up Natalie’s file on table which doubles up as a computer. He has computers on everything.] Wow. Very, very impressive individual.

Pepper: You’re so predictable, you know that?

Tony: She’s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?

Pepper: No one speaks Latin.

Tony: No one speaks Latin

Pepper: It’s a dead language. You can read Latin or you can write Latin, but you can’t speak Latin.

Tony: Did you model in Tokyo? ‘Cause she modelled in Tokyo.

Pepper: Well…

Tony: I need her. She’s got everything that I need. [Camera is now on Natalie and Happy, Natalie looking over, hearing what Tony is saying]

Happy: Rule number one, never take your eyes off your opponent. [He goes to take a swing, she grabs his hand and flips him over, legs over his head.]

Pepper: Oh, my God! Happy.

Tony: That’s what I’m talking about.

Happy: I just slipped.

Tony: You did?

Happy: [Who looks a little like he’s in pain] Yeah.

Tony: Looks like a TKO to me. [Rings the bell and Natalie leaves the ring]

Natalie: Just… I need your impression.

Tony: You have a quiet reserve. I don’t know, you have an old soul.

Natalie: I meant your fingerprint.

Tony: Right.

Pepper: So, how are we doing?

Tony: Great. Just wrapping up here. Hey. You’re the boss.

Natalie: Will that be all, Mr Stark?

Tony: No.

Pepper: Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman. Thank you very much. [She leaves. Tony turns to Pepper]

Tony: I want one.

Pepper: No.

[News report is heard. In French. It’s about the Grand Prix.

Tony, Pepper and Happy are seen leaving a car and walking into a building. Happy is carrying a red suitcase]

Tony: You know, it’s Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes, just go with it.

Pepper: Go with it? Go with what?

Natalie: Mr Stark?

Tony: Hey.

Natalie: Hello. How was your flight?

Tony: It was excellent. Boy, it’s nice to see you.

Natalie: We have one photographer from the ACM, if you don’t mind. Okay?

Pepper: When did this happen?

Tony: What? You made me do it.

Pepper: I made you do what?

Tony: You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don’t flare your nostrils.

Pepper: You are so predictable.

Tony: That’s the amazing thing.

Natalie: Right this way.

Tony: You look fantastic.

Natalie: Why, thank you very much.

Tony: But that’s unprofessional. What’s on the docket?

Natalie: You have a 9:30 dinner.

Tony: Perfect. I’ll be there at 11:00.

Natalie: Absolutely.

Tony: Is this us?

Natalie: It can be.

Tony: Great. Make it us.

Natalie: Okay.

Pepper: Mr Musk. How are you?

Mr Musk: Hi, Pepper. Congratulations on the promotion.

Pepper: Thank you very much.

Tony: Elon, how’s it going. Those Merlin engines are fantastic.

Mr Musk: Thank you. Yeah, I’ve got an idea for an electric jet.

Tony: You do?

Mr Musk: Yeah.

Tony: Then we’ll make it work. [To Pepper as they walk] You want a massage?

Pepper: Oh, God. No. I don’t want a massage.

Tony: I’ll have Natalie make an…

Pepper: I don’t want Natalie to do…

Tony: Don’t want you tense. By the way, I didn’t mean to spring this on you.

Pepper: Thank you very much.

Tony: Green is not your best colour. [Justin’s head appears from behind someone]

Pepper: Oh, please.

Justin: Anthony. Is that you?

Tony: [To Pepper] My least favourite person on Earth.

Justin: Hey, pal.

Tony: Justin Hammer.

Justin: How you doing? You’re not the only rich guy here with a fancy car. You know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair. You guys know each other? [She appears.]

Christine: Hi. Yes.

Pepper: Yes.

Tony: Yes, roughly.

Pepper: We do.

Justin: BTW, big story. The new CEO of Stark Industries.

Christine: I know, I know.

Justin: Congratulations.

Christine: My editor will kill me if I don’t grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.

Pepper: Oh.

Christine: Can I?

Pepper: Sure.

Justin: She’s actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair. I thought I’d throw her a bone, you know. Right?

Pepper: Right. Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.

Tony: And she wrote a story as well.

Pepper: It was very impressive.

Tony: That was good.

Pepper: It was very well done.

Christine: Thank you.

Pepper: I’m gonna go wash.

Tony: Don’t leave me.

Justin: Hey, buddy. How you doing?

Tony: I’m all right.

Justin: Looking gorgeous.

Tony: Please, this is tough.

Christine: Can I ask you… Is this the first time…

Justin: [Posing for a camera while Tony replaces sunglasses and tries to escape] Fromage [French for cheese. That bit did have a subtitle] Say “Brie”.

Christine: …that you guys have seen each other?

Tony: God, that’s so awful.

Christine: Listen, is it the first time you’ve seen each other since the Senate?

Tony: Since he got his contract revoked…

Justin: Actually, it’s on hold.

Tony: …when you were attempting to…That’s not what I heard. What’s the difference between “hold and “cancelled”? The truth?

Christine: Yes, what is it?

Justin: No. The truth is… Why don’t we put that away? The truth is, I’m actually hoping to present something at your Expo.

Tony: Well, if you invent something that works, I’ll make sure I get you a slot.

Natalie: Mr Stark?

Tony: Yes?

Natalie: Your corner table is ready.

Justin: I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.

Tony: Hammer needs a slot, Christine.

Justin: We kid, yeah. We kid. We’re kidders.

[Tony is doing another test. It reads Blood toxicity 53%. He’s in a bathroom.]

Tony: [In the mirror] Got any other bad ideas?

[And now he’s in a racing suit, jumping over the barrier towards a car.]

Justin: [Still inside, talking to Christine.] Tony and I… Tony… I love Tony Stark. Tony loves me. We’re not competitors. Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities for Hammer Industries, you know? Everything that Tony and I do…

Tony (on TV behind Justin): Well, what’s the use of having…

Justin: …is a healthy…

Tony: …and owning a race car…

Justin: …competition.

Tony: …if you don’t drive it?

Justin: Is he driving?

[Camera shift to Pepper sitting at her table, probably waiting for Tony. She notices the television.]

Pepper: Natalie. Natalie!

Natalie: Yes, Ms Potts?

Pepper: What do you know about this?

Natalie: This is the first that I have known of it.

Pepper: This, this cannot happen.

Natalie: Absolutely. I understand. How can I help you?

Pepper: Where’s Happy?

Natalie: He’s waiting outside.

Pepper: Okay, get him. I need Happy.

Natalie: Right away.

Justin: Tony’s… You know, he… We’re not competitive. You know what I mean?

Christine: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, can you excuse me just one second?

Justin: Just read me what you wrote.

Christine: I will. I will, after.

Justin: Just read it back to me.

Christine: But I have to make one quick phone call.

Justin: Where are you going?

Christine: This is great.

Justin: I’ve got some caviar coming.

Christine: This is great stuff. I’ll be right back.

Someone in background: Look! That’s Stark.

[And engines revving, set, go! The race takes off. A man dressed in orange as pit crew walks beside the track. He looks familiar. Tony’s surprisingly not bad at this race car driving. Orange man is on the track. Oh look, it’s Ivan. More French words. I got a “Mon Dieu” I think. The lightning whips strike a car. Pepper looks terrified. For Tony. Another “Mon Dieu” from the French commentator. Means “My God” by the way. Happy appears at the door and holds up the briefcase. Pepper goes with him to the car and gets in the back.]

Pepper: Go, go.

Happy: Hang on. [Crashes through a barrier onto the track heading the opposite way to the race cars. Tony’s car gets hit and he goes flying, loosing the front. Ivan heads forward. Another car gets hit. Bit of fire. Dripping petrol. Never a good sign.]

Pepper: Give me the case.

Happy: Here, take it.

Pepper: Where’s the key?

Happy: It’s in my pocket.

Pepper: Car!

[Ivan slices more of Tony’s car, but he’s gone. Tony comes up from behind him and whacks him around the head with a sheet of metal. Fighting. Tony is knocked on the floor. Sees dripping petrol. Ivan begins to swings the whips. Tony moves, hits petrol and the car bursts into flames. Happy appears, driving and runs Ivan into the fence. Tony is up the fence]

Tony: Are you okay?

Happy: Yeah.

Tony: Were you heading from me or him?

Happy: I was trying to scare him.

Tony: ‘Cause I can’t tell!

Pepper: Are you out of your mind?

Tony: Better security.

Pepper: Get in the car right now!

Tony: I was attacked. We need better security.

Happy: Get in the car.

Tony: You’re CEO. Better security measures. God, it’s embarrassing. [Ivan’s head moves. Tony opens the door] First vacation in two years. [And Ivan slices the door in half. Darn it Ivan, it’s a Rolls, be nicer to her]

Pepper: Oh my God! [Happy reverses a bit and runs into Ivan again.]

Happy: I got him!

Tony: Hit him again. Hit him again. Football.

Happy: I got him.

Pepper: Take the case! Take it!

Tony: Give him the case!

Pepper: Stop banging the car! [Out comes the airbag and Ivan slices the car in half. He continues to slice at the car]

Tony: Calm down.

Pepper: God. God.

Tony: Give me the case! Please! Come on! [Pepper throws the case, Tony stand on it and it turns into the Iron Man Suit! A fight begins. Which involves more damage to the car and damage to the Iron Man suit. Tony rips out the Arc Reactor, shutting off Ivan’s suit.]

Ivan: [Being taken away by the police] You… You lose. You lose Stark. [Justin smiles.]

[Scene change. In a prison.]

Police officer [French]: We ran his prints. We got nothing back, not even a name.

Tony [French]: Where are we going?

Police Officer [French]: Over there. We’re not even sure he speaks English. He hasn’t said a word since he got here.

Tony [French]: Five minutes.

Police officer [French]: [opening door] Five minutes. {Door is shut behind Tony.]

Tony: Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It’s effective. Not very efficient. But it’s a passable knock-off. I don’t get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places.

Ivan: You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.

Tony: Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?

Ivan: My father. Anton Vanko.

Tony: Well, I never heard of him.

Ivan: My father is the reason you’re alive.

Tony: The reason I’m alive is ‘cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed.

Ivan: Did I? If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him. And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come. The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you.

Tony: Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That’s right. A prison cell. I’ll send you a bar of soap. [He gets up to leave]

Ivan: Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium in the chest, painful way to die. [Tony leaves the cell]

[Scene change. On Tony’s private aeroplane. Stern is on the television]

Stern: It’s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he’s doing. He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy. I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant that these suits can’t exist anywhere else, don’t exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else, at least for five to ten years, and here we are in Monaco realising, “These suits exist now.”

Tony: Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That’s the truth.

Pepper: What is that?

Tony: This is your in-flight meal.

Pepper: Did you just make that?

Tony: Yeah. Where do you think I’ve been for three hours?

Pepper: Tony, what are you not telling me?

Tony: I don’t want to go home. At all. Let’s cancel my birthday party and… We’re in Europe. Let’s go to Venice, Cipriani. Remember?

Pepper: Oh, yes.

Tony: It’s a great place to be healthy.

Pepper: I don’t think this is the right time. We’re in kind of a mess.

Tony: Yeah, but maybe that’s why it’s the best time. ‘Cause then we can…

Pepper: Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up.

Tony: As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.

Pepper: A leave?

Tony: A company retreat.

Pepper: A retreat? During a time like this?

Tony: Just a ride. Well, I’m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.

Pepper: Not everybody runs on batteries Tony.

[Ivan is in a cell. A guard drops of food. Someone’s left a note about enjoying the potatoes. That would be easier if they were potatoes and not an explosive. A man enters, dressed like Ivan, down to the number. Ivan escapes. More French shouting. There was defiantly an “allez” in there. Ivan gets knocked out. He awakens somewhere else]

Justin: Hey. There he is. There he is. What an absolute pleasure. Welcome. Oh goodness gracious. Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here? Forgive me, I’m sorry. I’m such a huge fan of yours. I didn’t want to make a first impression like this. He’s not an animal. Come on. He’s a human being. Thank you. We’re fine. My name is Justin Hammer. I’d like to do some business with you. Please sit. Dig in. What do we have today Jack?

Jack: We have some salmon carpaccio.

Justin: Salmon carpaccio. Anything you want here, we got it. I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco. It’s Italian though. Organic ice cream. I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do too, for Tony Stark. What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track, how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody that was… Wow. You spoke to me with what you did. And I know that you knew that I’d be listening. This is why I couldn’t bear to have you shipped off to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent. But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don’t just go and try to kill the guy. I think, if I may, you go after his legacy. That’s what you kill. You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways. The only difference between you and I is that I have resources. I think, if I may, you need my resources. Someone behind you, a benefactor. I’d like to be that guy.

Ivan: [Russian; no subs unintelligible]

Justin: Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator. I don’t know. Have you been understanding everything I’m saying?

Ivan: Very good, man.

Justin: Very good, man.

Ivan: Very good, man.

Justin: Hey!

Ivan: [clinking bottle with Justin’s glass] Hey.

Justin: Yes?

Ivan: I want my bird.

Justin: A bird? You want a bird?

Ivan: I want my bird.

Justin: I can get you a bird. I can get you ten birds.

Ivan: I want my bird.

Justin: Well, okay. Nothing’s impossible. I could… Are we talking about… Is this a bird back in Russia?

[Scene change. Pepper and Natalie are back in Malibu.]

Pepper: [on phone] Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong despite the events in Monaco.

Natalie: [also on phone. But a different phone] Yes, of course. [To Pepper] The AP wants a quote.

Pepper: [covers speaker] Don’t tell them. Fax them…

Rhodey: [entering] Where is he?

Natalie: He doesn’t want to be disturbed.

Pepper: He’s downstairs.

News reader (on television): But what happened in Monaco?

Pepper: Yes, but….

News reader: But his continuing erratic behaviour may lead many people to ask themselves, “Can this man still protect us?”

Pepper: Iron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.

[Scene change. Tony is sitting in a car in his workshop looking at holograms.]

JARVIS: Query complete sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist who defected to the United States in 1963.However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967. His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist, was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons grade plutonium to Pakistan, and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison. No further records exist. [Rhodey enters]

Rhodey: Tony, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now. Listen. I’ve been on the phone with the National Guard all day, trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH, knocking down your front door and taking these. They’re gonna take your suits, Tony, okay? They’re sick of the games. You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years. Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday. It’s not theoretical anymore. Are you listening to me? Are you okay?

Tony: Let’s go. [Gets out the car. And falls.]

Rhodey: Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?

Tony: Yeah, I should get to my desk. [Rhodey supports him] See that cigar box?

Rhodey: Yeah.

Tony: It’s palladium.

Rhodey: [Tony removes Arc Reactor] Is that supposed to be smoking?

Tony: If you must know, it’s neutron damage. It’s from the reactor wall.

Rhodey: You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?

Tony: Road rash. Thank you. [Replaces Arc Reactor and starts drinking green liquid again.] What are you looking at?

Rhodey: I’m looking at you. You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it’s unnecessary. You don’t have to do this alone.

Tony: You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you’ve gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I’m doing.

QUEENS, NEW YORK.

Justin: This is where we do it. This is my humble abode. You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right? No pressure. Here they are. I’m very excited. They’re combat-ready. I may have done a few miscalculations and rushed the prototype into production. Sue me, I’m enthusiastic. Go ahead, take a look around. [Ivan puts on glasses and heads towards a computer] You don’t wanna do that. You’ll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes. Can we generate some encrypted pass codes? Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack. Never mind, I… Wow. Okay. Good stuff.

Ivan: [Something Russian] unintelligible

Justin: Sorry?

Ivan: Software shit.

Justin: Well… You’re good. You really blasted in past the firewall there. Let me show you where you’re gonna be working primarily. Go ahead, take a look. Get a good look at that. That’s something, isn’t it? You know, those are really just for show and tell. They’re $125.7 million a pop, so… Wait! [Ivan pulls off one’s head] Oh gosh. Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here. That’s where the pilot goes. I’m having a tough time finding volunteers. I’ll take care of that, just leave it.

Ivan: What you want them do?

Justin: Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years. I want to make Iron Man look like an antique. I wanna go to that Stark Expo, I wanna take a dump in Tony Stark’s front yard. You know what I’m talking about?

Ivan: I can do that. No problem.

Justin: Yeah? Hey, fabulous! I love it. Hey, this is our guy. Didn’t I tell you? I had a feeling.

[Tony’s rash on his chest is getting worse. Natalie enters.]

Natalie: Do you know which watch you’d like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?

Tony: I’ll give them a look. I should cancel the party.

Natalie: Probably.

Tony: Yeah. ‘Cause it’s…

Natalie: Ill-timed.

Tony: Right, sends the wrong message.

Natalie: Inappropriate. [Tony drinks a bit of his drink that Natalie hands him] Is that dirty enough for you?

Tony: Gold face, brown hand. The Jaeger. I’ll give that a look. Bring them over. [Natalie hands him the box of watches] I’ll take that. Why don’t you… [She sits, smiles softly and starts helping him cover his bruise] I gotta say it. It’s hard to get a read on you. Where are you from?

Natalie: Legal.

Tony: Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?

Natalie: I’d do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with. [She leaves Tony finishes his drink. Scene change. He’s now drunk, by a DJ, dancing in the suit. Cars pull up outside]

Person: Good evening

Person: Good evening

Rhodey: Yes, sir, I understand. No. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I’ll handle it. Sir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours, Iron Man will be back on watch. [Enters party] Hey Pepper.

Pepper: I’m going to get some air.

Rhodey: What’s wrong?

Pepper: [Showing Rhodey Tony] I don’t know what to do.

Rhodey: You gotta be kidding me. [Tony falls over, drunk] That’s it, I’m making….

Pepper: No, no, no. Don’t call anyone.

Rhodey: Pepper. This is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.

Pepper: I know. I know. I get it. I’m gonna handle it, okay Just let me handle it.

Rhodey: Handle it. Or I’m gonna have to.

Tony: [To crowd] You know, the question I get asked most often is, “Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?” Just like that. [Cheering. Pepper walks up to him]

Pepper: Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?

Tony: I love you.

Pepper: Unbelievable! Thank you so much. Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night. And we’re gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming.

Tony: No, no, no, we can’t … Wait, wait, wait. We didn’t have the cake. We didn’t blow out the candles.

Pepper: You’re out of control, okay? Trust me on this, okay?

Tony: You’re out of control gorgeous.

Pepper: It’s time to go to bed. It’s time.

Tony: Give me another smooch

Pepper: You’re not going to be happy about this.

Tony: Come on, you know you want to.

Pepper: You just peed in the suit.

Tony: I know. It has a filtration system.

Pepper: It’s not sexy.

Tony: You could drink that water.

Pepper: Just send everybody home, okay? It’s time to…

Tony: If you say so.

Pepper: Okay. I’ll take this, you take that [exchanges microphone for bottle]

Tony: Pepper Potts. She’s right. The party’s over. Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago. The after-party starts in 15 minutes. And if anybody, Pepper, doesn’t like it, there’s the door. [accidently shoots it with the suit.] Yeah! [Girl throws bottle it the air] Hit! [Rhodey leaves as he shoots it] Pull! [Rhodey goes downstairs. Drunk girl is still throwing things for Tony to shoot. Rhodey gets into one of the suits. Another girl appears with a watermelon] I think she wants the Gallagher!

Rhodey: [In full suit] I’m only gonna say this once. Get out. [Helmet slips down. Everybody leaves.] You don’t deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!

Tony: [To DJ] Goldstein.

Goldstein: Yes, Mr Stark?

Tony: Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy’s ass to. [Laughs. Another One Bites the Dust by Queen starts to play.]

Rhodey: [Grabbing hold on Tony from behind] I told you to shut it down. [Tony takes off backwards]

Tony: Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt. [Rhodey throws things at him] Really? [Tony hits him with a set of weights] Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn’t have a sidekick.

Rhodey: [Hitting Tony with a pipe] Sidekick this. [Tony goes up throw the ceiling.] Had enough?

[Quick camera angle shift]

Pepper: Natalie!

Natalie: Miss Potts.

Pepper: Don’t you “Miss Potts” me! I’m on to you. You know what? Ever since you came here… [Tony and Rhodey come crashing through the ceiling]

Happy: Pepper! [Runs in to get her out of the way] Get out of here. Get out of here now. [Natalie heads off somewhere.]

Tony: You want it? Take it! [Beats Rhodey and turns to growl at crowd, who run off. Rhodey gets back up]

Rhodey: Put you hand down.

Tony: You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?

Rhodey: We don’t have to do this, Tony.

Tony: You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.

Rhodey: Put it down!

Tony: You gonna take a shot?

Rhodey: Put it down!

Tony: No!

Rhodey: Drop it Tony!

Tony: Take it! [Their blasts meet and there goes Tony’s house. Both of them are knocked backwards. Tony looks around and sees Rhodey take off in the suit.]

EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE

MOJAVE, CA

Rhodey: Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet… [Rhodey lands in suit.]

Major Allen: Colonel.

Rhodey: Major.

Major Allen: Wow.

Rhodey: Yeah. Let’s take it inside.

Major Allen: Clear the area.

[Scene change. Tony is sitting inside a doughnut, eating a doughnut. Pans out to see Nick Fury looking up at him.]

Nick Fury: Sir! I’m gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.

Tony: [Now inside sitting at a table with Fury] I told you I don’t wanna join your super-secret boy band.

Fury: No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself. How’s that working out for you?

Tony: It’s… It’s… It’s… I’m sorry. I don’t wanna get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye? Honestly I’m a bit hung over. I’m not sure if you’re real of if I’m having…

Fury: I am very real. I’m the realest person you’re ever gonna meet.

Tony: Just my luck. Where’s the staff here?

Fury: That’s not looking so good.

Tony: I’ve been worse. [A woman walks over. Camera angle is such that you can’t see her face.]

SHIELD agent: We’ve secured the perimeter but I don’t think we should hold it for too much longer.

Tony: [Looks over top of glasses. Sees Natalie.] You’re fired.

Natalie: That’s not up to you. [Sits down next to Fury]

Fury: Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.

Tony: Hi.

Natalie/Agent Romanoff: I’m a SHIELD shadow. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.

Tony: I suggest you apologise.

Fury: You’ve been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you’re giving away all your stuff. You let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I didn’t know better…

Tony: You don’t know better. I didn’t give it to him. He took it.

Fury: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it? You’re Iron Man and he just took it? The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit? [Turns to Agent Romanoff] Is that possible?

Agent Romanoff: Well, according to Mr Stark’s database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.

Tony: What do you want from me?

Fury: What do we want from you? What do you want from me? [Agent Romanoff leaves] You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with. [Romanoff returns with an injection] Hit him.

Tony: Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it? [Rash goes down] Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?

Fury: What did we just do for you? That’s lithium dioxide. It’s gonna take the edge off. We’re trying to get you back to work.

Tony: Give me a couple of boxes of that. I’ll be right as rain.

Agent Romanoff: It’s not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.

Fury: Doesn’t look like it’s gonna be an easy fix.

Tony: Trust me, I know. I’m good at this stuff. I’ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium. I’ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.

Fury: Well, I’m here to tell you, you haven’t tried them all.

[Scene change. Hammer Industries]

Justin: Hey, hey, het. Special delivery. Candygram. [Ivan climbs down from where he was working] I brought you something. Oh yeah. [Removes cloth] We got you the bird, pal.

Ivan: This is not my bird.

Justin: What do you mean? That’s the bird. This is the bird. Yeah, pulled a lot of strings to get this bird. This is a great bird.

Jack: It’s a beautiful bird.

Justin: We got this bird all the way from Russia.

Ivan: Hey, man, this is not my bird.

Justin: Well, listen, even if it’s not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird. I mean, you know, look, don’t get so attached to things. Learn to let go. Wait a minute. Jack, what is that? Is that… That’s not a helmet. What is that? [Walks up to suit] Ivan… What’s this? Jack. Is that a helmet? It doesn’t look like a helmet to me. How… How are you supposed to get a head in there? Jack, could you put your head in there?

Jack: No.

Justin: Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there. [Jack put it on his head] See, Ivan? He can’t put his head in there. That’s… That’s not a helmet. It’s a head. I need to put a guy in there. I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?

Ivan: Drone better.

Justin: What? Drone better? Why is drone better? Why is drone better?

Ivan: People make problem. Trust me. Drone better.

Justin: Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird. You said, “No problem.” That’s what you said to me. You said, “No problem.” Now I need suits. The government wants suits. Like Iron Man. You understand? That’s what the people want. That’s what’s gonna make them happy.

Ivan: Hey, man. Don’t get too attached to things. Learn to let go.

Justin: These drones better steal the show, Ivan. You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.

[Scene change. Air base]

General: Unbelievable. This ought to get the Senate off my ass. It’s functional?

Rhodey: Fully mission-capable.

General: Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponise it.

Rhodey: Sir?

General: Justin Hammer’s making a weapons presentation at the Expo. We’d like this to introduce it.

Rhodey: Sir, I don’t believe that the Expo…

General: Colonel, the world needs to see this fast. We’ve got to make this happen.

Rhodey: Yes, General, but…

General: It’s also an order.

Rhodey: Yes sir.

General: Good work, Colonel. You’ve made your country proud.

Rhodey: Thank you sir.

[Scene change. Tony’s house. It’s a bit broken. He is sitting with Nick Fury.]

Fury: That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.

Tony: No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my…

Fury: No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery.

Tony: Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?

Fury: Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn’t deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.

Tony: You told me I hadn’t tried everything. What do you mean I haven’t tried everything? What haven’t I tried?

Fury: He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.

Tony: He said that?

Fury: Are you that guy? Are you? ‘Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.

Tony: I don’t know where you get your information, but he wasn’t my biggest fan.

Fury: What do you remember about your dad?

Tony: He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy who’s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.

Fury: That’s not true.

Tony: Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.

Fury: As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.

Tony: What?

Fury: I got a two o’clock

Tony: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What’s this?

Fury: Okay, you’re good, right?

Tony: No, I’m not good.

Fury: You got this? Right? Right?

Tony: Got what? I don’t even know what I’m supposed to get.

Fury: Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember Agent Coulson, right?

Tony: Yeah.

Fury: And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you. [Fury leaves]

Natalie/Agent Romanoff/Natasha (We’ll stick with Natasha from now on): We’ve disabled all communications. No contact with the outside world. Good luck. [She leaves]

Tony: [Turning to Agent Coulson] Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice.

Agent Coulson: I’m not here for that. I’ve been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?

Tony: I think I got it, yeah.

Agent Coulson: Enjoy your evening’s entertainment. [Leaves. Tony looks at the box that has been left for him.]

[Scene change. Air base. Dismantling the suit]

Major Allen: Think this is the power source?

Rhodey: Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let’s just focus on arming it, all right?

Major Allen: Yes, sir.

Justin: [Entering. Sucking on a red lollipop.] Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday? You got it. What did you do? What did you do? Is this what I think it is?

Rhodey: Yes it is. Hammer, I want to know what you’re gonna do for us.

Justin: What am I going to do for you? Well, the first thing I’m gonna do for you is I’m gonna upgrade your software. And then, second, I think I should…

Rhodey: That’s not what I’m talking about. I’m talking about firepower.

Justin: Well, you’re talking to the right guy. [Bites lollipop. Time jump. Kind of. He now has weapons to show to Rhodey.] Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol. Too downtown? I agree. M24 shotgun, pump action. Five-round magazine. You know what? You’re not a hunter. What am I talking about? I’m getting rid of it. This is the FN-2000 from Belgium. They do make something better than waffles. It’s beautiful, But I can tell this isn’t disco enough for you, so I’m gonna put it right here. You’re looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher. Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control. You’re tough. Let me tell you something. Size does matter. Don’t let anyone tell you different. This is an M134 7.62 Minigun. Six invidual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker. Our boys in uniform call in Uncle Gazpacho or Puff the Magic Dragon. Okay. These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos. This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethlyenetrinitamine RDX burst. It’s capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted. If it were any smarter, it would write a book. A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon. It would read it to you. This is my Eiffel Tower. This is my Rachmaninoff’s Third. My Pieta. It’s completely elegant. It’s bafflingly beautiful. And it’s capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero. I call it the Ex-Wife. That’s the best I got. Are we gonna do this? Give me something here. You’re like a sphinx. I can’t read you.

Rhodey: I think I’ll take it.

Justin: Which one?

Rhodey: All of it.

Justin: All of it.

[Scene change. Tony is looking through the box. Blue prints for the arc reactor. Newspaper articles. Video reels.]

Howard (on video): Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust heath, [Tony is flicking through a notebook as the video plays] and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. I’m Howard Stark, and everything you’ll need for the future can be found right here. City of the Future? City of Tomorrow? City of… I’m Howard Stark and everything you’ll need in the future can be found right here. So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I would like to personally… Tony, what are you doing back there? What is that? [Little Tony has picked one of the buildings up off the model.] Put that back. Put it back where you got it from. Where’s your mother? Maria? Go on. Go, go, go, go. [A man takes little Tony off, presumably to where his mother is]

Man (out of sight): All right, I think we got…

Howard: I’ll… I’ll… I’ll come in and… [Video changes]

Man: Are you waiting on me? [Howard drinks. Looks like whiskey. Video changes again]

Howard: So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I’d like to personally show you my ass. I’d like to… I can’t… This is… I can’t… We have this, don’t we? This is a ridiculous way… Everything [Tony reaches end of notebook. Blank pages. Probably ones his father never got to fill in as he died] is achievable through technology. [Tony throws the book to one side and drinks] Tony. You’re too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you. And someday you’ll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people’s inventions. It represents my life’s work. This is the key to the future. I’m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you’ll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world. What is and always will be my greatest creation is you. [Tony looks like he’s about to cry as the film ends.

Scene change. He’s driving down a road in car number plate Stark11

He stops to but some strawberries.]

Tony [Spanish]: How much?

Strawberry man: $6. Six.

Tony: I don’t have any dough. Here. [Takes off watch]

Strawberry man: No, sir, that’s too much.

Tony: No, it’s fine. Take that. It’s fine

Strawberry man: No, señor.

Tony: Take it. Take it. I don’t like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that’d be great.

Strawberry man: Are you Iron Man?

Tony: Sometimes.

Strawberry man: [As Tony drives off] We believe in you!

[Now in Pepper’s office]

Pepper: It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.

PA: Miss Potts?

Tony: Relax.

PA: Mr Stark…

Tony: Is here.

PA: He refuses…

Tony: I don’t. It’s fine. I’ll just be a second.

Pepper (on phone): Listen, it’s our position that Stark has and continues to maintain propriety ownership of the Mark II platform.

News reporter (on telly): When Mr Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man, he was making a promise to America.

Pepper: No, the suit belongs to us.

News reporter: We trusted that he would look out for us.

Pepper: Yeah, but you’re not…

News reporter: He obviously did not.

Pepper: Burt…

News reporter: And now we learn that his secretary…

Pepper: Yes, it does.

News reporter: …a woman named Virginia “Pepper” Potts, has been appointed as CEO of Stark Industries. What are her qualifications?

Pepper: No.

News reporter: Miss Potts has done nothing to manage this terrible…

Tony: Mute.

Pepper: No… Burt… Burt… Burt, listen to me. Don’t tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country and then not let me pursue this.

Tony: [Looking at boxes and things in the corner.] I’ll get this stuff out of here.

Pepper: Well, then, tell the President to sign an order. We’ll talk about it at the Expo. [Tony pulls back a sheet and finds the same model as that that was in the video with his father] Hammer’s giving some presentation tomorrow evening. Will Tony Stark be there?

Tony: [Pulling up a chair] Will I?

Pepper: No, he will not. Bye.

Tony: I would like to be. Got a minute?

Pepper: No.

Tony: Come on, you just got off the phone. You’re fine. 30 seconds.

Pepper: Twenty-nine Twenty-eight.

Tony: I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I’m not.

Pepper: You didn’t come here to apologise?

Tony: Look, that goes without saying, and I’m working on that. But I haven’t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It’s like a Ferris wheel, going. I’m trying to get some…

Pepper: No.

Tony: Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express… And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don’t care… I mean, I care. It would be nice. I’m not expecting you to… Look, here’s what I’m trying to say. I’m just gonna say it.

Pepper: Let me stop you right here, okay? Because if you say “I” one more time, I’m gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think. I am trying to run a company. Do you have any idea what that entails?

Tony: Yes.

Pepper: People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you’ve disappeared, and all I’m doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat of it. I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do. Did you bring me strawberries? Did you know that there’s only one thing on Earth that I’m allergic to?

Tony: Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.

Pepper: I need you…

Tony: I need you too.

Pepper: …to leave now

Tony: That’s what I’m trying to…

Natasha: [Entering as Natalie in front of Happy] Ms Potts?

Pepper: Hi, come on in.

Natasha: Wheels up in 25 minutes.

Pepper: Thank you.

Happy: Anything else, boss?

Tony: I’m good, Hap.

Pepper: No, I’ll be just another minute.

Tony: I lost both the kids in the divorce. [Tony looks over to Happy, who shakes his head.] Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn’t it? I thought you two didn’t get along?

Pepper: No. That’s not so.

Tony: It’s just me you don’t care for. No? Nothing?

Pepper: Actually, while you’re here maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.

Natasha: Absolutely. [Pepper and Happy leave] I’m surprised you can keep your mouth shut.

Tony: Boy, you’re good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things… You’re a triple imposter. I’ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?

Natasha: [Latin]

Tony: Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?

Natasha: It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected. [She leaves.]

Tony: You’re good. [Piles things up under desk spinny thing and throws strawberries in the bin. Goes back to the model and looks at it through one eye.

Scene change. Driving it home, fading into workshop]

Tony: Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection.

Jarvis: 1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.

Tony: [Lifting the blue projection away from the model] How many buildings are there?

Jarvis: Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?

Tony: That was rhetorical. Just show me. [Clicks his fingers and the model begins to spin and lifts upright] What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.

Jarvis: What is it you’re trying to achieve, sir?

Tony: I’m discovering… Correction. I’m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees. [Tony flicks things away] Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad. [The model now resembles a nucleus and Tony expands it.] Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school. [Tony snaps down so the model fits in his hand]

Jarvis: The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.

Tony: Thank Dad.

Jarvis: Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.

Tony: Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We’re back in hardware mode.

[Smashing walls with sledge hammers, drilling holes in the floor, fiddling with wires, putting together pipes.

Agent Coulson enters]

Agent Coulson: I heard you broke the perimeter.

Tony: Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?

Agent Coulson: I was doing some stuff.

Tony: Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I’m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?

Agent Coulson: [Pulls a familiar looking object out of a box] What’s this doing here?

Tony: That’s it. Bring that to me.

Agent Coulson: You know what this is?

Tony: [As Agent Coulson hands it to him] It’s exactly what I need to make this work. Lift the coil. Go, go. Put your knees into it. There you go. And… Drop it. Drop it. [The shield is now in position and the coil straight.] Perfectly level. I’m busy. What do you want?

Agent Coulson: Nothing. Goodbye. I’ve been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.

Tony: Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.

Agent Coulson: So I’m told.

Tony: Secret stuff?

Agent Coulson: Something like that. Good luck.

Tony: Bye. Thanks. [They shake hands]

Agent Coulson: We need you.

Tony: Yeah, more than you know.

Agent Coulson: Not that much. [He leaves. Tony goes back to building.]

Jarvis: Initialising prismatic accelerator. [Tony turns a wheel on top] Approaching maximum power. [Using a wrench as a lever, the wheel is turned, but not before cutting holes in the wall. Eventually it’s concentrated on a triangle which begins to glow blue.]

Tony: That was easy. [He removes the triangle using a pair of pliers]

Jarvis: Congratulations sir. You have created a new element. [Placed into arc reactor] Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core. I will begin running diagnostics.

[Scene change. Ivan is also building an arc reactor]

Justin (on phone from golf course): Hey Ivan. I got Senator Stern here. Thought we’d swing over and look at some of the drone designs.

Ivan: The drone is not going to be ready.

Justin: Not ready? What do you mean?

Ivan: I can make presentation, not demonstration.

Justin: What the hell is the difference?

Ivan: Presentation. No fly. No shoot.

Justin: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.

Ivan: I can make salute.

Justin: You can make salute? What do you mean “make salute”? What the hell does that mean Ivan? This is not what we agreed to, okay? You promised me suits and then you promised me drones. [Camera pans to show Ivan has remade his arc reactor whips]

Ivan: Hey, man, everything will be okay.

Justin: This is not what I wanted.

[Justin is back at Hammer Industries. Enters Ivan’s room with two men.]

Justin: Hey, there he is. It’s the bird man. Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I’m confused. You said it wasn’t, but now it looks like you’re the best of pals. You love that bird, don’t you? You know what? Take the bird.

Ivan: [As man grabs bird] Hey!

Justin: Take his pillows too. Both of them. And his shoes. Take his shoes. I took your stuff. How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad? Good. ‘Cause that’s how I feel! We had a contract. I saved your life and you give me suits. That was our deal. And you did not deliver. I don’t know if you’re a genius or a fraud. I don’t know what you are. Something really, really great fell into my lap. And if it hadn’t, I’d be at your mercy tonight. Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself. And now your overpriced paperweights and gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration. Do you dig what I’m getting at here?

Ivan: [Russian] unintelligible

Justin: I don’t know if you know this, but I don’t speak Russian! I’m gonna leave now. I’m gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I’ll even get laid. You see these guys? They’re your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we’re gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you’re gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don’t, you’re gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man. You got that? Maybe you can watch me on TV. [Leaves]

[Tony’s house]

Tony: Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You’re killing me. You know I don’t…

Jarvis: Incoming call with a blocked number sir.

Tony: My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How’s the Land of Enchantment?

Ivan: Hey, Tony, how you doing? I double cycle.

Tony: You what?

Ivan: You told me double cycle’s more power. Good advice.

Tony: You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.

Ivan: You too.

Tony: [mutes his speaker] Trace him.

Jarvis: Sir.

Ivan: Now, the true history of Stark name will be written.

Tony: Jarvis, where is he?

Jarvis: Accessing the Oracle grid. Eastern Seaboard.

Ivan: What your father did to my family over 40 years, I will do to you in 40 minutes.

Tony: Sounds good. Let’s get together and hash it out.

Jarvis: Tri-State area. Manhattan and outlying boroughs.

Ivan: I hope you’re ready. [Call ends]

Jarvis: Call trace incomplete.

[Sees advert for Justin’s presentation. Picks up new arc reactor]

Jarvis: Sir

Tony: You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you’re at it. Put it together now.

Jarvis: We are unclear as to the effects.

Tony: I don’t want to hear it Jarvis. [Reactor gains power] That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!

[Stark Expo. Natasha opens the door for Pepper to exit the car]

Happy: I’ll keep the car down here, all right?

Pepper: Thank you Happy.

Announcer: …Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.

[Begins. Justin dances on to the stage]

Justin: Yeah. That’s what I’m talking about. Thanks for coming. Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm’s way, but then the Iron Man arrived, and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us. Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach. That’s not fair. That’s not right. And it’s just too bad.

Pepper: Oh, Lord.

Justin: Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed the headlines the world over. Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a difficult problem. They are about to run out of ink. [Two people run on to remove the podium] Get that out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you the new face of the United States military. The Hammer drone. [Drones rise out of the stage as he calls names] Army! Navy! Air Force! Marines! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! That’s a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you. But as revolutionary as this technology is, there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war [Ivan is typing something] Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you the very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.

Pepper: What? [Rises and salutes.]

Justin: For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for… [incoming Iron Man]

Tony: We got trouble.

Rhodey: Tony, there are civilians present. I’m here on orders. Let’s not do this right now.

Tony: Give them a wave.

Justin: Hey, all right. Yeah.

Tony: All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.

Rhodey: Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?

Tony: Listen, I think he’s working with Vanko.

Rhodey: Vanko’s alive?

Justin: Yeah. [Tony approaches him]

Tony: What is he?

Justin: What?

Tony: Where’s Vanko?

Justin: Who?

Tony: Tell me.

Justin: What are you doing here man?

Rhodey: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

Tony: [As a large gun takes aim] Is that you?

Rhodey: No, I’m not doing that. That’s not me. I can’t move. I’m locked up. I’m locked up! [Drones take aim] Get out of here. Go! This whole system’s been compromised.

Tony: [Takes off] Let’s take it outside. [Drones and Rhodey fire at him. Rhodey takes off]

Rhodey: No, no!

Tony: Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.

Jarvis: Yes sir.

Rhodey: Tony, Tony, I’m locked on. I have target lock.

Tony: On what?

Rhodey: On you. [Shooting at Tony] Tony, on your six!

Justin: [Running to a computer] What’s going on? What’s happening?

Technician: The software’s been overridden.

Justin: What? What do you mean it’s been overridden? What does that mean?

Technician: I think he slaved the drones.

Justin: That’s impossible. Call the guards.

Jack: All the phones are down sir.

Justin: Well, then call their… Call their cells.

Jack: Their cell phones are not working either sir.

Technician: He’s locked us out of the mainframe.

Pepper: [Entering] Who’s locked you out of the mainframe?

Justin: Please, please, go away. Go away. I’ve got this handled.

Pepper: Have you now?

Justin: Yes, I do. In fact, if your guy hadn’t showed up, this wouldn’t be happening. So, please, now go away. Thank you [To technician] Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here. What?

Natasha: [Grabs Justin and holds him down on the desk] You tell me who’s behind this. Who’s behind this?

Justin: Ivan. Ivan Vanko.

Natasha: Where is he?

Justin: At my facility.

[Natasha lets go and leaves. Pepper dials a number on her phone]

Pepper: I need NYPD, please.

Justin: No, no, no!

Pepper: Command Central.

Justin: No, no, honey. Don’t call the authorities.

Pepper: Okay. Right away. Right away. [To Justin] Step aside. Step aside. [To technician] Tell me everything you know. Go.

[Tony is still being chased by Rhodey’s suit and the air force drones]

Tony: How are we doing Jarvis?

Jarvis: Remote reboot unsuccessful.

[Other drones are now firing at the running crowds. Natasha leaves the building.]

Security guard: This way.

Happy: Nobody’s answering the phone. What’s going on?

Natasha: Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.

Happy: I’m not taking you anywhere.

Natasha: Fine. You want me to drive?

Happy: No, I’m driving. Get in the car.

[Lots of shooting drones and people screaming. The kid with the Iron Man helmet is targeted by a drone and holds his hand up. Tony lands behind him and shoots the drone with his hand repulsor]

Tony: Nice work kid. [Takes off again]

Rhodey: You got multiples coming in on you.

Tony: Let’s get this away from the Expo.

[Inside car]

Natasha: Wen we arrive, I need you to watch the perimeter. [She’s getting undressed in the back of the car] I’m gonna enter the facility and take down the target. Watch the road.

Happy: I got it. I got it.

[Tony and Rhodey. Tony sets off one car alarm, the drones set off the rest.

Ivan is still typing inside Hammer Industries]

Rhodey: Listen, listen. A pack just peeled off. They’re headed back to the Expo.

Tony: Got it.

Rhodey: In closing in on you. Ordnance coming in hot Tony. Watch it.

[Hammer Industries. Happy parks the car outside. More of less]

Natasha: Stay in the car.

Happy: I’m not staying in the car.

Natasha: I said, stay in the car.

Happy: [As Natasha heads up the stairs to the front door] What are you wearing? Look, I’m not letting you go in there alone.

Natasha: You want to help? Keep the car running.

Happy: [Opens the door as she unlocks it and runs in] Okay.

[Ivan gets a security breach message]

Hammer security guard: Hey, hey, hey. You can’t come in here.

[Happy punches him and Natasha heads past.]

Second guard: Hold on. Hey!

[Natasha fights the other guards. Some using her SHIELD tech, some just kicking or punching them.

Back at Expo]

Technician: Each set of drone is communicating in its own unique language.

Pepper: Well, choose one and focus on that.

Justin: Have you tried Russian? Why don’t you try Russian?

[Hammer Industries. Happy is still fighting the same guard.]

Announcement: Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.

Security guard: We got it. We’re on our way.

[And Natasha throws something. And takes on like five guards at once. She walks away, casually spraying one with pepper spray. All this while Happy’s fighting one guy. Happy wins.]

Happy: I got him! [Sees what Natasha has done

Ivan gets up.

Tony is trying to let the drones away]

Tony: Rhodey, you still locked on?

Rhodey: Yeah.

Tony: Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We’re about to get wet on this ride.

Rhodey: Wait, wait, wait!

[Tony leads the drones through the globe sculpture. Most explode hitting parts of it.

Natasha kicks open Ivan’s door, a gun in each hand. Happy is behind her. The room is empty.]

Natasha: He’s gone.

[Tony and Rhodey]

Tony: I’m sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd. What’s your 20?

[Directly above him. Both crash into biodome

Natasha puts her guns on the table and starts typing.]

Happy: What are you doing?

Natasha: I’m rebooting Rhodey’s suit.

[Rhodey is on top of Tony, who is pushing the gun to keep it from shooting him]

Rhodey: Tony.

[Natasha gains access.

Rhodey’s suit shuts down]

Natasha: Reboot complete [Image of Tony on screen] You got your best friend back.

Tony: Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.

Natasha: Well done on the new chest piece. I am reading significant higher output and your vitals all look promising.

Tony: Yes, for the moment, I’m not dying. Thank you.

Pepper: [Image appears on second screen] What do you mean you’re not dying? Did you just say you’re dying?

Tony: Is that you? No, I’m not. Not anymore. [Natasha looks confused.]

Pepper: What’s going on?

Tony: I was going to tell you. I didn’t want to alarm you.

Pepper: You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?

Tony: You didn’t let me.

Pepper: Why didn’t you tell me that?

Tony: I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.

Natasha: Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming Tony. Looks like the fight’s coming to you.

Tony: Great. Pepper?

Pepper: Are you okay now?

Tony: I am fine. Don’t be mad. I will formally apologise…

Pepper: I am mad!

Tony: …when I’m not fending off a Hammeroid attack.

Pepper: Fine.

Tony: We could have been in Venice.

Pepper: Oh please.

[Tony taps Rhodey’s helmet as the system restarts.]

Tony: Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They’re coming. Come on, let’s roll. Get up.

Rhodey: [Helmet opens] Oh, man. You can have your suit back.

Tony: [Helps him up] You okay?

Rhodey: Yeah, thanks. Tony, look, I’m sorry, okay?

Tony: Don’t be.

Rhodey: No. I should have trusted you more.

Tony: I’m the one who put you in this position. Forget it.

Rhodey: No. It’s your fault. I just wanted to say I’m sorry.

Tony: Thank you. That’s all I wanted to hear. Partner. They’re coming in hot, any second. What’s the play?

Rhodey: Well, we want to take the high ground, okay? So let’s put the biggest gun up on that ridge.

Tony: Got you. Where do you want to be?

Rhodey: Where are you going?

Tony: What’re you talking about?

Rhodey: I meant me.

Tony: You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.

Rhodey: Tony, don’t be jealous.

Tony: No. It’s subtle all the bells and whistles.

Rhodey: Yeah. It’s called being a badass.

Tony: Fine. All right. You go up to. I’ll draw them in.

Rhodey: Don’t stay down here. This is the worst place to be.

Tony: Okay, you got a spot. Where’s mine?

Rhodey: It’s the kill box, Tony. Okay This is where you go to die. [Drones incoming. And Rhodey and Ton are still in the kill box. Helmets down. Shooting begins.]

Tony: See that?

Rhodey: Yeah, yeah. Nice.

Tony: Rhodey? Get down. [Laser slices all the drones in half. And a tree.]

Rhodey: Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.

Tony: Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It’s a one-off.

[Back inside Expo]

Justin: I told you that five minutes ago.

Pepper: [As police enter] That’s your guy here.

Justin: Excuse me?

Police officer: You’re being placed under arrest.

Justin: Are you kidding me?

Police officer: Hands behind your back sir.

Justin: I’m trying to help here. I get it. I see what you’re doing. You’re trying to pin this on me, huh? That’s good. That’s good. You’re starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition. I like that. You think you’re making a problem for me? [Being led away] I’m gonna make a problem for you. I’m gonna be seeing you again real soon.

Pepper: [Now outside with some police officers] When they get here, I think you should station them at the south, east and both west exits.

Police officer: We shut down the 7 train in and out of Willets Point already.

Pepper: Well, have city buses there to ferry people to operating lines.

Police officer: Yeah. Are you coming with us?

Pepper: No, I’m gonna stay until to park is clear.

Police officer: Okay.

[Hammer Industries]

Natasha: Head up. You got one more drone incoming. This one looks different. [Tony and Rhodey; Natasha on speaker] The repulsor signature is significantly higher.

Ivan: [Landing in a full suit] Good to be back.

Rhodey: This ain’t gonna be good. [Ivan’s whisps turn on] I got something special for this guy. I’m gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.

Tony: With the what? [Rhodey shoots it and it bounces off Ivan, fizzling off in the water] Hammer tech?

Rhodey: Yeah.

Tony: I got this. [Targets points on Ivan’s armour. Doesn’t do much. Both shooting, fighting. Ends with both Tony and Rhodey held onto by Ivan’s whips] Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?

Rhodey: What?

Tony: I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.

Rhodey: This is your idea?

Tony: Yep.

Rhodey: I’m ready. I’m ready. Go, go, go!

Tony: Take it! [Same as at the house, they shoot each other and the middle explodes. Unfortunately for Ivan, he is in the middle]

Ivan: You lose. [Dies. Reactor starts flashing red. So do all the drones]

Rhodey: All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here man.

Tony: Pepper? [Takes off. Pepper is by a drone. Tony grabs her just as it explodes. They land on a roof. Takes off helmet.]

Pepper: Oh my God. I can’t take this anymore.

Tony: You can’t?

Pepper: I can’t take this.

Tony: Look at me.

Pepper: My body, literally, cannot handle the stress. I never know if you’re gonna kill yourself or wreak the whole company.

Tony: I think I did okay. [Everything being on fire having been covered by exploding drones behind him. One more explosion. Just as he finishes speaking.]

Pepper: I quit. I’m resigning. That’s it.

Tony: What did you just say? You’re done? That’s surprising. No, it’s not surprising. I get it. You don’t have to make excuses.

Pepper: I’m… I’m… I’m not making any excuses.

Tony: You actually were just making excuses. But you don’t have to.

Pepper: No, I wasn’t making an excuse. I’m actually very justified.

Tony: Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better.

Pepper: Well…

Tony: You’ve taken such good care of me. I’ve been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so… Right?

Pepper: Thank you.

Tony: Yeah.

Pepper: Thank you for understanding.

Tony: Yeah, yeah. Let’s talk clean-up.

Pepper: I’ll handle the transition. It’ll be smooth.

Tony: Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That’s gonna seem…

Pepper: Well, with you it’s like dog years.

Tony: I know.

Pepper: I mean, it’s like the Presidency. [They kiss]

Tony: Weird.

Pepper: No, it’s not weird.

Tony: It’s okay, right?

Pepper: Yeah.

Tony: Run that by me again. [They start to kiss again]

Rhodey: I think it was weird. [They break apart and turn around] You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.

Pepper: I had just quit, actually.

Tony: Yeah, so we’re not…

Rhodey: You don’t have to do that. I heard the whole thing.

Tony: You should get lost.

Rhodey: I was here first. Get a roof.

Tony: I thought you were out of one-liners.

Rhodey: That’s the last one.

Tony: You kicked ass back there, by the way.

Rhodey: Thank you. You too. Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I’m gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?

Tony: Not okay. Not okay with that.

Rhodey: It wasn’t a question. [Takes off]

Tony: How are you gonna resign if I don’t accept?

[Scene change. Some kind of building. Tony is inside sitting at a table. SHIELD logo is there.

Picks up file. AVENGERS INITIATIVE PREMLIMIARY REPORT

Nick Fury enters while looking and stops him opening it]

Fury: I don’t think I want you looking at that. I’m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff’s assessment of you. Read it. [Hands Tony the file]

Tony: “Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.” In my own defence, that was last week. “Prone to self-destructive tendencies.” I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? “Textbook narcissism”? Agreed. Okay, here it is. “Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.” I gotta think about it.

Fury: Read on.

Tony: “Tony Stark not… Not recommended”? That doesn’t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I’m trying to do right by Pepper. I’m in a stable-ish relationship. [Fury walks round and rest against the table by Tony’s chair]

Fury: Which leads us to believe at this juncture we’d only like to use you as a consultant. [Tony stands and offers his hand. They shake]

Tony: [Clasping his other hand on top of Fury’s] You can’t afford me. [Goes to leave, but turns around again] Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.

Fury: I’ll see what I can do.

[Scene change. Washington. ACDC’s Highway To Hell Starts to play]

Stern: It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony Stark, who is, of course, a national treasure. [Pinning on medals] Thank you Lieutenant Colonel, for such and exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.

Rhodey: Thank you sir.

Stern: Mr Stark. Thank you for such as exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this. [Tony winces in pain] Oh, sorry. Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn’t it? Let’s get a photo.

[Pose for a photo. Roll credits. Cue end credits scene. A car rolls up. Well-dressed shoes. Agent Coulson looks down on a crater. Takes off sunglasses and pulls out phone]
Agent Coulson: Sir, we’ve found it.
[Camera pans out and there seems to be a hammer. The End.](Shows the Iron Man suits getting destroyed.)

Tony Stark (V.O.): We create our own demons. Who said that? What does that even mean? Doesn't matter, I said it cause he said it. So now he was famous and that's basically get said by two well known guys. I don't, uh... (Sighs)

(Screen goes black.)

Tony Stark (V.O.): I'm gonna start again. Let's track this from the beginning.

(Effel 65's "I'm Blue" playing over the MARVEL logo.)

(1999, Bern, Switzerland, New Years Eve Party.)

Happy Hogan: (to Maya.) Half hour till the ball drops.

Tony Stark: Hey, do you want...?

Party Guest: Tony Stark? Great speech, man!

(Hogan moves the man away from Tony.)

Happy Hogan: I got you, pal.

Tony Stark: I gave a speech? How was it?

Happy Hogan: Pitiful

Maya Hansen: Unintelligible.

Tony Stark: Really?

Maya Hansen: Mmm-hmm.

Tony Stark: It's my favorite kind, a winning combo.

(They start walking together.)

Maya Hansen: Where are we going?

Tony Stark: Uh, to town on each other, probably back in your room. Cause I also wanna see your research.

Maya Hansen: Okay, you can see my research, but that's...I'm not gonna show you my "town."

Ho Yinsen: Mr. Stark

(As Tony & Maya are walking away the man intercepts them.) Ho Yinsen.

Tony Stark: Oh, I finally met a man called "Ho."

(Tony & Yinsen shake hands. While, Yinsen chuckles humorlessly; Tony turns to Maya.) Come here.

Ho Yinsen: I would like to introduce you to our guest, Dr. Wu.

(Yinsen moves them towards Wu.)

Tony Stark: [to Wu] Oh, this guy.

Ho Yinsen: Mr. Stark.

Tony Stark: Hey. (Dr. Wu greets Tony in mandarin as they shake hands.) You're a heart doctor. She's going to need a cardiologist after I... (Tony turns, starts blowing on his party horn & walks away with Maya.)

Maya Hansen: Bye.

Ho Yinsen: Perhaps another time.

Tony Stark (V.O.): It started in Bern, Switzerland, 1999.

(People yelling indistinctly.) The old days.

Aldrich Killian: Mr. Stark!

Tony Stark (V.O.): I never thought they'd come back to bite me. Why would they? [As Tony and Maya walk towards the elevator an enthusiastic man with long hair comes up towards them]

Aldrich Killian: Oh, wow! Hey, Tony! Aldrich Killian. (Stuttering To Maya) I'm a big fan of your work!

Maya Hansen: My work?

Tony Stark: Who isn't? He means me.

Aldrich Killian: Well, of course. But, Miss Hansen, my organization has been tracking your research since year two of MIT.

[Tony, Maya and Hogan walk into the elevator]

Happy Hogan: Yeah, we're full.

[Hogan puts his arms out to stop Aldrich from coming inside, but he ducks under Hogan's arms and moves into the elevator]

Tony Stark: Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut.

[Hogan traps Aldrich by the wall]

Happy Hogan: What floor are you going to, pal?

Aldrich Killian: Oh, now, that is an appropriate question. The ground floor, actually. I've got a proposal I'm putting together with myself. It's a privately funded think tank called, Advanced Idea Mechanics. [He holds out two business cards towards Tony and Maya]

Tony Stark: Uh... she'll take both.

Maya Hansen: Okay. [takes the cards]

Tony Stark: One to throw away and one to not call.

Aldrich Killian: Advanced Idea Mechanics, or AIM for short. (Points to the logo on his shirt) Do you get it?

Tony Stark: I see that, cause it's on your t-shirt.

Aldrich Killian: Aw!

Tony Stark: (to the party of women in the elevator; referring to Hogan as they walk out) Ladies, follow the mullet.(To Maya) Ladies first.

Maya Hansen: (to Aldrich as she walks out of the elevator) Thank you, I'll call you.

[as everyone walks out of the elevator, Tony stops Aldrich from getting out by putting out his arm in front of him]

Tony Stark: I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.

Aldrich Killian: Yeah?

Tony Stark: Yeah, cheese clown. I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes. [steps out of the elevator] I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick. You know what I'm talkin' about?

Aldrich Killian: I'll see you up there.

[the elevator door closes]

Tony Stark: Damn betcha.

[Scene change to Maya's room}

Tony Stark: Come on! I thought that was just a theory.

Maya Hansen: Well, it was. If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain that governs repair...

[we see they are looking at a computer monitor with graph of the brain]

Tony Stark: Wow.

Maya Hansen: ...And chemically recode it.

Tony Stark: That's incredible. Essentially you're hacking into the genetic...

Both: ...Genetic operating system...

Tony Stark: ...of a...

Maya Hansen: Exactly.

Tony: ...living organism.

Maya Hansen: Yes.

Tony Stark: Wow.

[Hogan touches Maya's plant]

Maya Hansen: Is that... Can you...

Happy Hogan: What?

Maya Hansen: Can you not touch my plant. It's not...she doesn't like it. She prefers...

Tony Stark: She's not like the others.​​​​​​ (to Maya) Come on. Let's go in the bedroom. Happy...

Maya Hansen: That's cute, but...

Tony Stark: Leave her ficus alone.

Maya Hansen: [turns to Hogan] Because... and, no, seriously don't. [walks into the bedroom]

Tony Stark: And you're starting with plants?

Maya Hansen: For now, yeah.

Tony Stark: Huh.

Maya Hansen: I'm calling it Extremis.

[Happy reaches for the plant and pulls off some leaves to just throw them on the ground.]

[Tony and Maya continue talking about her research in the bedroom]

Maya Hansen: Well, it's...

Both: Human application.

Maya Hansen: Exactly! Exactly.

[Zooms in on the plant and it's growing a new "Limb"]

Maya Hansen: Dendritic revitalization.

Tony Stark: It's revolutionary.

Maya Hansen: Disease prevention...

Tony Stark: Changes the world.

Maya Hansen: ...even limb regrowth.

[Goes back to Maya and Tony]

Tony Stark: You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.

Maya Hansen: Wow.

Tony Stark: In Switzerland.

Maya Hansen: Hmm, that's better. Aw, you're seeing things.

Tony: This week.

[Maya takes off Tony's glasses, Tony laughs]

Tony Stark: You almost bought it, didn't you?

[Maya puts on the glasses and Happy shuts the door. He nods and they start kissing to be interrupted by an explosion and glass shattering.]

Maya Hansen: This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.

Tony Stark: Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?

Maya Hansen: The what?

[at that moment Hogan runs into the room and tackles Tony onto the bed to make sure he's okay]

Happy Hogan: Down! Stay down! Stay down, boss.

Tony Stark: We're good.

Happy Hogan: Stay down.

Tony Stark: You're...you're right on me. I made it. (Happy gets up) What the hell was that?

[People counting down outside.]

Happy Hogan: What was that?

Maya Hansen: It's a glitch in my work. It's...

Tony Stark: She was just talking about it. Glitches happening.

Happy Hogan: It's not Y2K.

Maya Hansen: No.

[Tony hears people celebrating outside]

Tony Stark: Hey!

Happy Hogan: Happy New Year.

Tony Stark: Happy New Year.

Maya Hansen: Happy New Year.

Tony Stark: Alright, I'll see you in the morning, goodnight.

[Tony shakes hands with Hogan]

Happy Hogan: You good?

Tony Stark: Yep.

Happy Hogan: I'll be right outside.

Tony Stark: Okay.

[Hogan leaves the room; we then see Aldrich on top of the building waiting for Tony, who never shows]

Tony Stark: [voice over] So why am I telling you this? Because I had just created demons, and I didn't even know it.

[we see Tony writing a note 'You know who I am', and leaving it on the bedside table for Maya before leaving; Maya hears the door close]

Tony Stark: [voice over] Yeah, those were the good times. Then I moved on. After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene. Forgot that night in Switzerland. These days I'm a changed man, I'm different now. I'm well... you know who I am.

[Present Day, Malibu, California - Tony is in his lab injecting himself with some devices]

Tony Stark: Ow!

JARVIS: Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate...

Tony Stark: No. Forty-eight. [he injects himself] Ah! Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.

JARVIS: As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore.

Tony Stark: Which I will. Right, let's do this.

[to the robot that's using a broom to clear the rubbish off the floor]

Tony Stark: Dummy. Hi, Dummy. How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it.

[Tony walks towards the robot]

Tony Stark: Hey. Hey! What are you doing round in the corner? You know what you did. Blood on my mat, handle it.

JARVIS: Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly seventy-two hours.

[addressing the Iron Man suits that are in their glass cages]

Tony Stark: Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite. I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother.

[to Jarvis as he records Tony with a camera]

Tony Stark: Start tight and go wide, stamp in time. Mark 42 autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test. Initialize sequence.

[Tony raises his hands and motions to activate the new suit]

Tony Stark: Jarvis, drop my needle.

[music starts playing, Tony moves with the music then points his arm where he'd been injecting himself toward the dismantled Iron Man suit on the table opposite, nothing happens]

Tony Stark: Crap.

[Tony bites his arm where he'd injected himself once and then hits it five times, he points his arm again and this time a part of the suit flies over to Tony and attaches itself to his hand and extends to his arm and shoulder, Tony then points his other arm toward the suit and the second part attaches itself to his hand and arm, Tony laughs]

Tony Stark: Alright, I think we got this. Send 'em all.

[the leg part flies over and attaches itself to Tony's leg, then as another part flies over it crashes into one of the Iron Man suit glass cages, then another part hurls itself at Tony and Tony inflects it with his arm making it crash]

Tony Stark: Probably a little fast, slow it down. Slow it down just a...

[suddenly another part of the suit shoots over and Tony ducks as it narrowly misses hitting him in the head]

Tony Stark: ...little bit.

[the other parts fly over and attach themselves with force to Tony's back and crotch area]

Tony Stark: Cool it, will you, Jarvis?

[then all the other parts shoot over and get attached to Tony, accept for the final face piece, which just hovers, facing Tony]

Tony Stark: Come on. I ain't scared of you.

[the face piece flies over and Tony flips over to grab the piece and finally the Iron Man suit is fully attached to Tony]

Tony Stark: I'm the best.

[at that moment, one of the stray pieces of the suit shoot over to Tony, knock hims down, which knocks the entire suit, except for the head piece, off Tony]

JARVIS: As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work.

Tony Stark: [voice over] And I guess seventy-two hours isn't a long time between siesta's. Didn't think it could get any worse. Then I had to go and turn on the TV.

[the news on TV shows footage of The Mandarin]

Tony Stark: [voice over] That's when he happened.

The Mandarin: Some people call me a terrorist, I consider myself a teacher. America, ready for another lesson. In 1864 in Sand Creek Colorado the U.S. military waited till the friendly Cheyenne braves all gone hunting, waited to attack and slaughter their families left behind, and claim their land. Thirty-nine hours ago the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked. I...I...I did that. A quaint military church filled with wives and children, of course. The soldiers were out on maneuvers, the braves were away. President Ellis, you continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir. And now, you've missed me again. You know who I am, you don't know where I am, and you'll never see me coming.

[as this footage ends, the TV channels change and all the news channels are talking about The Mandarin]

[the news on TV shows President Ellis addresses The Mandarin Threat]

News Reporter #1: And now that we seem to be back, let's recap some of the frightening...

News Reporter #2: American Airwaves were highjacked...

News Reporter #3: The nation remains on high alert...

News Reporter #4: All attempts to find the Mandarin have so far proved unsuccessful...

President Ellis: Central to my Administration's response to this terrorist event, is a newly minted resource. I know him as Colonel James Rhodes, the American people will soon know him as the Iron Patriot.

[we then see Bill Maher talking about this on his show]

Bill Maher: And how is President Ellis responding? By taking the guy they call War Machine and giving him a paint job.

[then we see Joan Rivers on 'The Fashion Police' talking about the new Iron Man suit]

Joan Rivers: Same suit, but painted red, white, and blue. Look at rhat. And they also renamed him Iron Patriot. You know, just in case the paint was too subtle.

[Rhodes and Tony Stark are at a bar and they see Joan Rivers making fun of the Iron Patriot suit on TV]

Colonel James Rhodes: It tested well with focus groups, alright?

Tony Stark: [putting on a mocking voice] I am Iron Patriot...

Colonel James Rhodes: Listen, War Machine was a little too aggressive, alright? This sends a better message.

Tony Stark: So what's really goin' on? With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?

[Tony moves closer to Rhodes]

Colonel James Rhodes: It's classified information, Tony. Okay, there have been nine bombings.

Tony Stark: Nine.

Colonel James Rhodes: The public only knows about three. Here's the thing, nobody can ID a device. There's no bomb casings.

Tony Stark: You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a...I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air.

Colonel James Rhodes: When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?

Tony Stark: Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?

Colonel James Rhodes: People are concerned about you, Tony. I'm concerned about you.

Tony Stark: You're gonna come at me like that?

Colonel James Rhodes: No. No, look, I'm not trying to be a dic...

[a girl and a boy come up to their table]

Colonel James Rhodes: ...tator.

Erin: Do you mind signing my drawing?

Tony Stark: If Richard doesn't mind. [to Rhodes] You alright with this, Dick?

Colonel James Rhodes: Fine with me.

[Tony looks at the drawing of himself in his Iron Man suit that the girl has drawn]

Tony Stark: [To the girl] What's your name?

Erin: Erin.

[Tony looks at the boy standing next to him]

Tony Stark: I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way.

[as Tony is signing Erin's drawing]

Colonel James Rhodes: Listen, the Pentagon is scared. After what happened in New York... aliens, come on. They need to look strong. Stopping the Mandarin is priority, but it's not...

Tony Stark: It's not superhero business, I get it.

Colonel James Rhodes: No, it's not, quite frankly. It's American business.

Tony Stark: That's why I said I...got it.

[suddenly as Tony is signing the drawing he looks ill, he places his hand on his face]

Colonel James Rhodes: Are you okay?

Tony Stark: I broke the crayon.

Erin: Are you okay, Mr. Stark?

Colonel James Rhodes: Take it easy. Tony...

Little Boy: [the little boy whispers to Tony] How did you get out of the wormhole? How did you get out of the wormhole?

[suddenly Tony rises and starts walking off]

Colonel James Rhodes: Wait a minute! Tony!

[Rhodes follows Tony as he walks out the bar]

Tony Stark: What'd he say?!

Colonel James Rhodes: Tony!

Tony Stark: Sorry. Have to check on the suit...make sure...okay.

[Tony steps into his Iron Man suit that was parked outside the bar and collapses to his knees]

Tony Stark: Check the heart, check the...check the...is it the brain?

JARVIS: No sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity.

Tony Stark: Okay, so I was poisoned?

Jarvis: My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.

Tony Stark: Me?

[Rhodes knocks on the Iron Suit's head, people have gathered around them watching Tony]

Colonel James Rhodes: Come on, man. This isn't a good look, open up.

Tony Stark: Sorry, I gotta split.

[Tony flies off in his suit]

[at Stark Industries Hogan points to his badge as walks through the lobby passing the other employees]

Happy Hogan: Badge. Badge. Come on, badge. Badge, guys. I put a memo in the toilet, come on. [referring to Tony's robots as Hogan meets with Pepper] Tony has got them in his basement, they're wearing party hats. This is an asset that we can put to use.

Pepper Potts: Uh-huh. So, you're suggesting that I replace the entire janitorial staff with robots?

Happy Hogan: What I'm saying is that the human element of Human Resources is our biggest point of vulnerability. We should start phasing it out immediately.

Pepper Potts: What!?

Happy Hogan: [to another employee as Hogan walks past them] Excuse me, Bambi.

Pepper Potts: [Hogan points to his badge] Did you just say that?

Happy Hogan: Security.

Pepper Potts: Happy?

Happy Hogan: Yes.

Pepper Potts: Okay, I am thrilled that you're now the Head of Security, okay? It is the perfect position for you.

Happy Hogan: Thank you.

Pepper Potts: However...

Happy Hogan: I do appreciate it

Pepper Potts: Since you've taken the post...

Happy Hogan: You don't have to thank me.

Pepper Potts: We've had a rise in staff complaints of three hundred percent

Happy Hogan: Thank you.

Pepper Potts: That's not a compliment.

Happy Hogan: That's not a compli...? It is a compliment! Clearly somebody's trying to hide something.

Pepper Potts: I...

Pepper's Assistant: Excuse me.

Pepper Potts: Yes?

Pepper's Assistant: Miss Potts, your four o'clock is here.

Pepper Potts: Thank you.

Happy Hogan: Did you clear this four o'clock with me?

Pepper Potts: Happy, we'll talk about this later. But right now I have to go deal with this very annoying thing.

[Pepper starts walking towards her office]

Happy Hogan: How so?

Pepper Potts: I used to work with him, and he used to ask me out all the time. So it's a little awkward.

[Hogan opens her office glass door and they enter]

Happy Hogan: I don't like the sound of that.

[as they step inside, they see Aldrich, looking handsome and fit in a business suit]

[Pepper looks shocked at the change in Aldrich's appearance]

Aldrich Killian: Pepper.

Pepper Potts: Killian?

Aldrich Killian: You look great. You look really great.

Pepper Potts: God, you look...you look great. I... I...I can't... What on earth have you been doing?

Aldrich Killian: Nothing fancy, just five years in the hands of physical therapists. And please, call me Aldrich.

Happy Hogan: Uh...you were supposed to be issued a security badge.

Pepper Potts: Happy, it's okay.

Happy Hogan: Yes?

Pepper Potts: We're good.

Happy Hogan: You sure?

Pepper Potts: Yes. Stand down.

Happy Hogan: Okay. I'm gonna linger, right here.

Pepper Potts: Thank you.

Happy Hogan: Okay.

[Hogan steps out of Pepper's office and closes the glass door]

Pepper Potts: It's very nice to see you, Killian.

[as Hogan waits outside Pepper's office, he sees Aldrich's man sitting in the waiting area]

Happy Hogan: Hey, guy.

[Hogan points to his security badge and the guy picks up his badge from the table next to him and holds it up to show Hogan he has a badge; to an employee as they walk past him]

Savin: Merry Christmas.

[Hogan looks at him with suspicion]

[back in Pepper's office]

Aldrich Killian: After years dodging the President's ban on "immoral biotech research", my think tank now has a little something in the pipeline. It's an idea we like to call Extremis. I'm gonna turn your lights down.

[he dims the lights then holds in his hand three small metal balls]

Aldrich Killian: Regard the human brain.

[he throws the balls onto the coffee table and as they roll and stop, they project a 3d image into the room]

Aldrich Killian: Uh...wait. Hold on, hold on. That's...that's the universe, my bad. But if I do that...

[he presses his projector control which changes the 3d image to show inside of the brain]

Aldrich Killian: That's the brain. Strangely mimetic though, wouldn't you say?

Pepper Potts Wow, that's amazing!

Aldrich Killian: Thanks, it's mine.

Pepper Potts: What?

Aldrich Killian: This...you're inside my head. It's a...

[he taps behind his ear, referring to something embedded inside his head]

Aldrich Killian: It's a live feed. Come on up, I'll prove it to you.

[Aldrich rises from the couch and stands on the coffee table]

Aldrich Killian: Come on.

[he helps Pepper to stand on the coffee table next to him, they stand directly in the 3d image]

Aldrich Killian: Now, pinch my arm. I can take it. Pinch me.

[Pepper pinches him and immediately something lights up in the 3d image of Aldrich's brain]

Pepper Potts: What is that?

Aldrich Killian: It's the primary somatosensory cortex. It's the brain's pain center. But this is what I wanted to show you.

[he turns Pepper round and presses his projector control and starts changing and moving the image with his hand]

Aldrich Killian: Now, Extremis harnesses our bioelectrical potential and it goes...here. This is essentially an empty slot, and what this tells us is that our mind, our entire DNA in fact, is destined to be upgraded.

Pepper Potts: Wow.

[as Hogan sits outside Pepper's office, he gets a call on his tablet, he answers the call and holds the tablet high so the camera monitor shows his forehead and eyes]

Happy Hogan: Hello?

Tony Stark: Is this forehead of Security?

Happy Hogan: What? You know, look, I got a real job. What do you want? I'm working, I got something going on here.

[we see Tony is in his lab]

Tony Stark: What? Harassing interns?

Happy Hogan: Let me tell you something, you know what happened when I told people I was Iron Man's body guard? They would laugh in my face.

[Tony laughs]

Happy Hogan: I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity. Now I got a real job, I'm watching Pepper.

Tony Stark: What's going on? Fill me in.

Happy Hogan: For real?

Tony Stark: Yeah.

Happy Hogan: Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist. Rich guy, handsome.

Tony Stark: Right.

Happy Hogan: I couldn't make his face at first, right? You know I'm good with faces.

Tony Stark: Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best.

Happy Hogan: Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials, I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in... where were we in '99? The science conference?

Tony Stark: Um...Switzerland.

Happy Hogan: Right, right, exactly.

Tony Stark: Killian? No, I don't remember that guy.

Happy Hogan: Of course you don't. He's not a blond with a big rack. At first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it's like getting weird. He's showing her a big brain.

Tony Stark: His what?

Happy Hogan: Big brain, and she likes it. Here, let me show you. Hold on. See? [he holds his tablet up and points it towards Pepper's glass office, where Aldrich and Pepper are standing close together on the coffee table watching the 3d image of the brain, but all Tony sees is Hogan pointing the tablet camera at himself]

Tony Stark: Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen and then we can get started.

Happy Hogan: I'm not a tech genius like you. Just...just trust me, get down down here.

Tony Stark: Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing.

Happy Hogan: I can't! I don't know how to flip the screen! Don't talk to me like that anymore. You're not my boss.

[as Hogan is talking, Tony uses his small tablet device to look up Aldrich and finds his photo]

Happy Hogan: Alright, I don't work for you. Now I don't trust this guy. He's got another guy with him, he's shifty.

Tony Stark: Relax.

Happy Hogan: Seriously?

Tony Stark: I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?

Happy Hogan: You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here. This woman... this woman's the best thing that ever happened to you, and you...you're just ignoring her.

Tony Stark: A giant brain?

Happy Hogan: Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character. I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.

Tony Stark: I miss you, Happy.

Happy Hogan: Yeah, I miss you too. But the way it used to be. Now you're off with the 'superfriends', I don't know what's going on with you anymore. The world's getting weird...

Tony Stark: Hey, I...I'd hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?

Happy Hogan: Why?

Tony Stark: I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her.

[he puts his small tablet in his wine fridge and closes it and walks off still with Hogan online]

Happy Hogan: Yeah, nice.

[back in Pepper's office after Aldrich has show her his new research]

Aldrich Killian: Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism and recode its DNA.

Pepper Potts: It would be incredible.

Aldrich Killian: Mm.

Pepper Potts: Unfortunately, to my ears it also sounds highly weaponizable. As in enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is not...

Aldrich Killian: Tony. Tony. You know, I invited Tony to join AIM thirteen years ago, he turned me down. But something tells me now there is a new genius on the throne who doesn't have to answer to Tony anymore, and who has slightly less of an ego.

Pepper Potts: It's gonna be a no, Aldrich. As much as I'd like to help you.

[we see Aldrich leaving the building]

Aldrich Killian: Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed. But then as my father used to say, 'Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph.'

Pepper Potts: That's very deep.

Aldrich Killian: Mm

Pepper Potts: And I have no idea what it means.

Aldrich Killian: Well, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man.

[Pepper laughs]

Aldrich Killian: I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.

[Aldrich kisses her gently on the cheek and Pepper watches him as he walks off, then Pepper notices Hogan coming toward her, Pepper looks flustered]

Pepper Potts: Happy...

Happy Hogan: The car is ready, if you're ready to go.

[Pepper glances over to Aldrich as he walks towards his car]

Pepper Potts: Yes. I just um... God, I forgot my... other thing, so... I'm just gonna...

[she walks back into the building, Hogan glance over to Aldrich's car and as it drives away, Hogan takes a photo of the license plate]

[later Pepper returns to Tony's home, as she gets out of the car she sees a large stuffed rabbit outside the house that Tony has bought for her as a gift, she walks inside]

Pepper Potts: I'm sorry I'm late. I was... What the...? What is that?!

[she notices Tony sat in his Iron Man suit on the couch]

Pepper Potts: You're wearing this in the house now? What is that, like Mark 15?

[Tony looks at the small number marked 42 on the suit]

Tony Stark: Uh...yeah. Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby.

Pepper Potts: Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?

[Tony rises and walks toward her]

Tony Stark: Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so.

[Tony shakes his ass and Pepper laughs]

Tony Stark: Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?

Pepper Potts: Yes, I did. I...I don't know how I could have missed that Christmas present. Is it gonna fit through the door?

Tony Stark: Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall.

Pepper Potts: Okay.

Tony Stark: So, uh...tense? Good day?

[Tony walks up behind her and starts massaging her shoulders]

Tony Stark: Ooh shoulders, a little naughty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?

Pepper Potts: Did I like it?

Tony Stark: Nailed it, right?

Pepper Potts: Wow. I appreciate the thought very much.

[Pepper turns to face Tony, she rises from her seat and stands close to him]

Pepper Potts: So why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?

[Tony knocks the metal helmet on his head]

Tony Stark: Huh. Yup, dammit. No can do. You wanna just kiss it on the...

Pepper Potts: Uh-huh.

Tony Stark: The facial slit?

Pepper Potts: Well, why don't I run down to the garage and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?

Tony Stark: Crowbar. Yeah.

[Pepper starts walking towards Tony's lab]

Tony Stark: Oh, except there's been a...uh...a radiation leak.

Pepper Potts: I'll take my chances.

Tony Stark: That's risky.

[Pepper walks down the stairs to Tony's lab]

Tony Stark: At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that.

[Pepper sees Tony is in fact not in his Iron Man suit, but in the lab exercising as he remotely controls the suit, which follows Pepper into the lab]

Tony Stark: Busted.

Pepper Potts: This is a new level of lame.

Tony Stark: Sorry.

[Pepper notices the food tray in the corner]

Pepper Potts: You ate without me, already? On date night?

Tony Stark: [referring to Mark 42 suit] He was just...

Pepper Potts: You mean you?

Tony Stark: Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work.

Pepper Potts: Uh-huh.

Tony Stark: And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.

[Mark 42 suit turns its face toward her, as if to look at her accusingly]

Pepper Potts: What?

Tony Stark: What?

Pepper Potts: Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?

Tony Stark: Happy was concerned.

Pepper Potts: No, you're spying on me.

Tony Stark: I wasn't...

Pepper Potts: I'm going to bed.

[Pepper turns and starts walking off]

Tony Stark: Hold on. Come on. Pep.

[as Pepper starts walking upstairs]

Tony Stark: Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry.

[Pepper stops and looks at him]

Tony Stark: I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything.

[Pepper walks back down]

Tony Stark: Nothing's been the same since New York.

Pepper Potts: Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all.

Tony Stark: You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker.

[he pauses for a moment and sits down]

Tony Stark: But threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you. My suits, they're uh...

Pepper Potts: Machines.

Tony Stark: They're part of me.

Pepper Potts: A distraction.

Tony Stark: Maybe.

[Pepper walks towards Tony and they hold each other. He rests his head against her chest and she removes his headband that controls the Iron Man suits]

Pepper Potts: I'm gonna take a shower.

Tony Stark: Okay.

[Pepper turns to walk off, then stops and looks at him]

Pepper Potts: And you're gonna join me.

Tony Stark: Better.

[later that night, as Tony and Pepper are sleeping, Tony starts having nightmares about when he was in New York with The Avengers and had to get rid of the nuke in space, Pepper wakes and starts to shake Tony awake]

Pepper Potts: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony...

[suddenly Pepper gets grabbed and shoved off Tony by Mark 42 suit, this wakes Tony who commands the suit]

Tony Stark: Power down!

[the suit shuts down and Tony hits it making its pieces fall apart, he looks over at Pepper who is in shock]

Tony Stark: I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors. Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?

[Pepper rises and starts to leave]

Tony Stark: Don't go, alright? Pepper?

Pepper Potts: I'm going to sleep downstairs. Tinker with that.

[Pepper leaves the room]

[at the Chinese theater in Los Angeles, we see Aldrich's henchman meet a man who's sat outside the theater]

Savin: Can you regulate?

Taggert: Yes, I can regulate.

Savin: Are you sure about that?

Taggert: Yes.

[Hogan who's been following Savin, keeps an eye on him from a distance, he sees Savin giving the man a briefcase]

Savin: It's a decent batch. Don't say I never did nothin' for you.

Taggert: Thank you...I mean for understanding.

[Savin walks off, Hogan walks towards Taggert and as Taggert rises to leave Hogan bumps into him which knock the briefcase out of Taggert's hand, falling open on to the ground]

Happy Hogan: I'm sorry, buddy.

[Hogan helps him put the stuff back in the suitcase, and as he looks at Taggert he notices that he is glowing red, Hogan starts to walk off taking one of the items from the suitcase, but suddenly Savin bumps into him]

Savin: What are you doin', buddy? You out by yourself? A little date night? Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?

Happy Hogan: Yeah, a little movie called "The Party's Over", starring you and your junkie girlfriend, and here's the ticket. [Hogan shows him what he took from Taggert's suitcase]

Savin: No kidding? That doesn't belong to you. [Savin goes to take the item from Hogan's hand, but Hogan punches Savin in the face twice, Hogan notices Savin's face glow red and heal, then Savin grabs hold of Hogan and with super strength throws him aside, as Savin walks towards Hogan, Taggert begins to glow red and turn super hot]

Taggert: Savin!

Savin: What?

Taggert: Help! Help me! [Taggert suddenly explodes, causing a massive explosion inside the theater which wounds Hogan, as he lies injured, Hogan sees Savin, also glowing red and then healing and walking off as if nothing has happened]

[we see another TV footage from The Mandarin]

The Mandarin: True story about fortune cookies. They look Chinese, they sound Chinese, but they're actually an American invention. Which is why they're hollow, full of lies, and leave a bad taste in the mouth. My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knock-off, The Chinese Theater. Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close. And don't worry, the big one is coming; your graduation.

[as Hogan lies in hospital critically injured, Tony is sat in his room when a nurse walks in to check on Hogan]

Tony Stark: Hi.

Happy's Nurse: Oh.

Tony Stark: [referring to the TV] Uh...mind leaving that on?

Happy's Nurse: Sure. [Tony rises from his seat]

Tony Stark: Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'. That's his show, he thinks it's elegant. [he pauses for a moment] One more thing...make sure everyone wears their badges. He's a stickler for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't let anyone in without them. [Tony turns to leave]

[news reporters are all waiting for Tony outside the hospital]

Hospital News Reporter: We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark. We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...his reaction to the latest attack. [Tony walks out and all the reporters swarm toward him] Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark! Our sources are telling us that this is another Mandarin attack. Anything else you can tell us? [Tony ignores the questions and walks toward his car]

Pushy Tabloid Reporter: Hey, Mr. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy? Just sayin'. [Tony turns to face the reporter]

Tony Stark: Is that what you want? Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I've decided [He removes his sunglasses and stares into the phone's camera] that you just died, pal. I'm gonna come get the body. There's no politics here; it's just good old-fashioned revenge. There's no Pentagon; it's just you and me. And on the off-chance you're a man, here's my home address: 10-8-80, Malibu Point, 9-0-2-6-5. I'll leave the door unlocked. [to the reporter] That's what you wanted, right? [He takes the phone and throws it at a wall] Bill me. [Tony gets in his car and drives off]

[as Tony is working his lab]

JARVIS: I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir. Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I., and C.I.A. intercepts. Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction. [Tony starts looking at all the data gathered]

Tony Stark: Okay, what do we got here? His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning "adviser to the King". South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater. [Tony pushes the virtual information down to close] Close. [Tony looks at the virtual crime scene reconstruction]

JARVIS: The heat from the blast was in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius. Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly.

Tony Stark: No bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the Chinese theater.

JARVIS: No, sir.

Tony Stark: Talk to me, Happy. [in the virtual reconstruction, Tony sees Hogan pointing his finger at some dog tags] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] Any military victims?

JARVIS: Not according to public records, sir.

Tony Stark: Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees.

JARVIS: The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now.

Tony Stark: Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack. [Tony looks at the information popping up] Nope. [he sees an attack in Rose Hill, Tennessee] That. You sure that's not one of his?

JARVIS: It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.

Tony Stark: Bring her around.

JARVIS: The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius. [Tony looks at all the information being presented on the Tennessee attack]

Tony Stark: That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?

JARVIS: Creating a flight plan for Tennessee. [as Tony is about to get ready to leave for Tennessee, he hears his door bell ring]

Tony Stark: Are we still at "ding-dong"? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?

JARVIS: There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address. [we see Maya standing outside Tony's house, the glass doors are opened and she enters]

Tony Stark: Right there's fine. [Tony dressed in his Iron Man suit walks toward her] You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?

Maya Hansen: You don't remember. Why am I not surprised?

Tony Stark: Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast.

JARVIS: Gluten-free waffles, sir.

Tony Stark: That's right.

Maya Hansen: Okay, look, I need to be alone with you. Someplace not here, it's urgent.

Tony Stark: Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship. [as he turns to walk into the living room, two bags are thrown down from the above balcony] It's...with her.

Pepper Potts: Tony, is somebody there? [Tony steps out of his suit]

Tony Stark: Yeah, it's Maya Hansen. [Maya smiles] Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely. [as Pepper starts walking downstairs, Tony moves towards Maya and speaks quietly] Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met.

Maya Hansen: He's thirteen. And no, I need your help.

Tony Stark: What...what for? Why now?

Maya Hansen: Because I read the papers, and, frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.

Tony Stark: I'll be fine.

Pepper Potts: I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests.

Tony Stark: We weren't.

Maya Hansen: No, I...

Pepper Potts: And old girlfriends!

Tony Stark: She's not really.

Maya Hansen: No, not really. It...it was just one night.

Tony Stark: Yep.

Pepper Potts: That's how you did it, isn't it? Yep.

Tony Stark: It was a great night.

Pepper Potts: Well, you know...

Maya Hansen: Yeah.

Pepper Potts: You have saved yourself a world of pain.

Maya Hansen: I'm sure.

Tony Stark: What?

Pepper Potts: Trust me. [to Tony] We're going out of town.

Tony Stark: Okay, we've been through this. Nope.

Pepper Potts: Yep!

Tony Stark: The man says no.

Pepper Potts: Immediately and indefinitely!

Tony Stark: Honey...

Maya Hansen: Great idea. Let's go.

Tony Stark: I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.

Pepper Potts: Tony, this is how normal people behave.

Tony Stark: I can't protect you out there. I challenged... [Maya notices giant stuffed rabbit Tony had bought for Pepper]

Maya Hansen: Is...is that normal?

Tony Stark: Yes, this is normal!

Pepper Potts: Sadly, that...is very normal.

Tony Stark: It's a big bunny, relax about it!

Pepper Potts: Calm down!

Tony Stark: I got this for you.

Pepper Potts: I'm aware of that.

Tony Stark: You still haven't even told me that you liked it!

Pepper Potts: I don't like it!

Tony Stark: I asked you three... You don't like it?! [as Tony and Pepper are bickering, Maya notices on the TV that helicopters are coming toward Tony's home]

Pepper Potts: Tony, we are leaving the house; that's not even up for discussion.

Tony Stark: I said no.

Maya Hansen: Guys, can we um...

Tony Stark: What?

Maya Hansen: [she points to the bomb heading straight for the house] Do we need to worry about that? [The house is suddenly hit, as everything explodes around them, Tony manages to get his Iron Man suit onto Pepper to protect her from the fall, Tony looks over to Maya, who's lying unconscious on the ground, as the ceiling is about to fall on Tony, Pepper saves him with the Iron Man suit]

Pepper Potts: I got you.

Tony Stark: I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here. [the helicopters starts shooting at the house] Move! I'm right behind! [as they run to get out, the floor between Pepper and Tony collapses] Get her, I'm gonna find a way around. [Pepper hesitates] Stop stopping! Get her, get outside! Go! [Pepper manages to grab Maya and use the Iron Man suit to get them safely out of the house, but the house gets further destroyed as the helicopters continue to fire on it]

Pepper Potts: Oh my God. Tony! [back inside as the house is being destroyed around Tony]

JARVIS: Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure. [Tony motions for his Iron Man suit to come off Pepper and onto him]

Tony Stark: Jarvis, where's my flight power?!

JARVIS: Working on it, sir. This is a prototype. [Tony manages to fire a piano at a helicopter to destroy it]

Tony Stark: That's one.

JARVIS: Sir, the suit is not combat-ready. [Tony manages to get away from the bullets being fired at him from one of the remaining helicopters and again uses his suit to bring down the helicopter]

Tony Stark: That's two. [as the helicopter explodes it crashes into the house, the remaining helicopter continues on shooting at the house, finally the remains of house with Tony inside fall into the ocean, Pepper runs to the edge of the cliff and looks down into the ocean. In the water, Tony starts to feel like he's drowning]

Pepper Potts: Tony!

JARVIS: Sir, take a deep breath. [after a few moments Tony's suit gets its flight power activated by Jarvis] Flight power restored. [finally Tony manages to fly out of the ocean.]

[The screen goes black]

JARVIS: Sir. Sir!

Tony Stark: Alright, kill the alarm. I got it.

JARVIS: That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent. [Tony notices that he's flying through the snow at night, he falls and crashes into the ground in the middle of a forest, he takes off his face helmet as he lies on the ground catching his breath]

Tony Stark: It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?

JARVIS: We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee.

Tony Stark: Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta...

JARVIS: I prepared a flight plan. This was the location.

Tony Stark: Who asked you? Open the suit.

JARVIS: I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.

Tony Stark: Open eject. [the suit gets off Tony and he sits up] That's brisk! [as Tony starts to feel the cold weather.] Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.

JARVIS: I actually think I need to sleep now, sir. [the suit loses power]

Tony Stark: Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy. [Tony drags the suit to a petrol station and makes a call to Pepper]

Computer Voice: Stark Secure Server: Now transferring to all known receivers.

Tony Stark: Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance because...I can't come home yet. I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe. That's all I know. I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian. [Tony drags the suit to an abandoned looking farmhouse, he places the suit on a couch and sits next to it] Let's get you comfy. [he places its hand by its side] You happy now? [as Tony tries to fix the micro-repeater implants in his arm, a boy stands by the doorway and points his toy gun at Tony]

Harley Keener: Freeze! Don't move.

Tony Stark: You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS. [the boy points his gun at a glass on a shelf and shoots at it, breaking the glass] And now you're out of ammo.

Harley Keener: What's that thing on your chest?

Tony Stark: It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here.

Harley Keener: What does it power? [Tony stands and points the desk light at his suit sitting on the couch behind him] Oh my God! [Harley drops his toy gun and takes a step towards Tony] Oh my god! That... that's... Is that Iron Man?

Tony Stark: Technically, I am.

Harley Keener: Technically, you're dead. [he give Tony a newspaper which has Tony's picture with the headline 'Mandarin Attack: Stark presumed dead']

Tony Stark: A valid point.

Harley Keener: [referring to the suit as he sits next to it on the couch checking it out] What happened to him?

Tony Stark: Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him.

Harley Keener: Like a mechanic?

Tony Stark: Yeah.

Harley Keener: Oh. If I was building Iron Man and War Machine.

Tony Stark: [Interupting Harley] It's Iron Patriot now.

Harley Keener: That's way cooler!

Tony Stark: No, it's not.

Harley Keener: Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro...

Tony Stark: Retroreflective panels?

Harley Keener: To make him stealth mode.

Tony Stark: You want a stealth mode?

Harley Keener: Cool, right?

Tony Stark: That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.

Harley Keener: [as he touches the suit, Harley accidentally snaps off one of its fingers] Oops!

Tony Stark: Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone.

Harley Keener: S...Sorry.

Tony Stark: Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?

Harley Keener: Well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I... I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago.

Tony Stark: Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need: a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich.

Harley Keener: What's in it for me?

Tony Stark: Salvation. What's his name?

Harley Keener: Who?

Tony Stark: The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?

Harley Keener: How'd you know that?

Tony Stark: I got just the thing. [he opens a compartment on the suit and takes out a metal object] This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding, it's a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face, press the button on top. It discourages bullying. Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass. [Harley reaches out to take it, but Tony pulls his hand away] Deal? Deal? What'd you say?

Harley Keener: Deal.

Tony Stark: Deal? [Tony gives the object to Harley] What's you're name?

Harley Keener: Harley. And you're...

Tony Stark: The mechanic. Tony [Tony looks at Harley for a moment] You know what keeps going through my head? Where's my sandwich? [back at Tony's house, which is now surrounded by emergency rescue and news reporters, Pepper stands alone and looks out across the ocean. She sees one of Tony's shattered Iron Man helmets and pulls it towards her, her forehead resting against the helmet's. She sees a red flashing light inside the helmet and as she puts the helmet on she receives the message Tony had left her earlier]

Computer Voice: Stark Secure Server. Retinal scan: Verified.

Tony Stark: Pepper, it's me. [Pepper gasps and smiles] I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.

[later that night as Pepper drives Maya home]

Pepper Potts: Why were you at the house tonight? What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?

Maya Hansen: [A beat] I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin. So if you still want to talk about it, I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe.

Pepper Potts: Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think? But Tony says you're a botanist, so...

Maya Hansen: That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder running a team of forty out of a privately-funded think tank, but sure you can call me a botanist.

Pepper Potts: This boss of yours, does he have a name?

Maya Hansen: Yeah, Aldrich Killian. [Pepper looks at her in shock]

[we see Aldrich talking on the phone to Savin]

Savin: Well, we took the house down, sir...

Aldrich Killian: Mmhmm.

Savin: But there's no sign of a body.

Aldrich Killian: I see.

Savin: No Stark.

Aldrich Killian: I have to go. [Aldrich rises from his seat walks towards another room] The Master is about to record and he's a little... Well, you know how he gets. Keep your appointment tonight and call me when it's done. [Aldrich walks into a room which has been set up as a set with all of Mandarin's props in place and camera crew ready to record Mandarin's message] Alright everybody. No talking and no eye contact, unless you wanna get shot in the face.

[we then see the Mandarin arrive with his entourage and enter the house]

Mandarin Look-Out: The Master is travelling. [the Mandarin arrives on set and takes a sit, he looks at Aldrich]

The Mandarin: Well then. What are we waiting for?

[in Rose Hills, Tennessee, Tony and Harley walk in town at night]

Tony Stark: The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that. [he pulls his sleeve up and we see he's wearing a little girl's pink watch, Harley laughs]

Harley Keener: She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition. When can we talk about New York?

Tony Stark: Maybe never, relax about it.

Harley Keener: What about The Avengers, can you talk about them?

Tony Stark: I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space. [they stop and Tony looks at the remains of the local explosion site that Tony came to investigate] What's the official story here? What happened?

Harley Keener: I guess this guy named Chad Davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. One day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here. [Tony looks around at the remains]

Tony Stark: Six people died, right?

Harley Keener: Yeah.

Tony Stark: Including Chad Davis?

Harley Keener: Yeah. [Tony keeps looking around at the remains of the explosion site]

Tony Stark: Yeah. That doesn't make sense. [he sits next to Harley] Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows.

Harley Keener: Yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to Heaven. Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five.

Tony Stark: Do you buy that?

Harley Keener: That's what everyone says. You know what this crater reminds me of?

Tony Stark: No idea. I'm not...I don't care.

Harley Keener: That giant wormhole, in um...in New York. Does it remind you?

Tony Stark: That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.

Harley Keener: Are they coming back? The aliens?

Tony Stark: Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?

Harley Keener: Does this subject make you...make you edgy?

Tony Stark: Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?

Harley Keener: Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you...do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? Do you have medication?

Tony Stark: Nope.

Harley Keener: Do you need to be on it?

Tony Stark: Probably.

Harley Keener: Do you have PTSD?

Tony Stark: I don't think so.

Harley Keener: Are you...are you going completely mental? I can stop, do you want me to stop? Do you want me to stop?

Tony Stark: Remember when I said to stop doing that? I swear to God, you're going to freak me out! [Tony, looking agitated, suddenly rises] Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?

Harley Keener: What did I say? [Tony starts running off and Harley runs after him] Hey, wait up! Wait, wait. [Tony stops running and Harley catches up with him] What the hell was that? [Tony holds his face in his hands for a moment and then throws some snow at Harley]

Tony Stark: Your fault, you spazzed me out. Okay, back to business. Where were we? The guy who died...relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis, where is she?

Harley Keener: Where she always is.

Tony Stark: See, now you're being helpful. [later we see Tony walking towards a bar and he bumps into a woman] Sorry. [the woman drops something] Lady, this uh... [he picks up the item and hands it back to the woman]

Brandt: Thank you. [Tony notices the woman has burn marks on one side of her face]

Tony Stark: Nice haircut, suits you.

Brandt: Nice watch.

Tony Stark: Yeah, limited edition.

Brandt: Oh, I don't doubt it. [there's a moment's pause] Well, have a good evening. [the woman turns and walks off] [Tony enters the bar and walks up to Mrs. Davis, who's sat at table drinking alone]

Tony Stark: Mrs. Davis, mind if I join you?

Mrs. Davis: Free country.

Tony Stark: It sure is. [Tony sits next to her, Mrs. Davis looks at Tony for a moment]

Mrs. Davis: Alright. Where'd you like to start?

Tony Stark: I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened.

Mrs. Davis: Look, I brought your damn file. You take it and go. [she drops the file in front of him] Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it. [Tony opens the file]

Tony Stark: Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?

Mrs. Davis: Yeah. [Tony looks at the file again and notices a photo of Taggart next to the photo of Chad]

Tony Stark: Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him.

Mrs. Davis: What?

Tony Stark: As a weapon.

Mrs. Davis: You're not the person who called me after all, are you? [suddenly a cell phone is slammed on their table]

Brandt: Actually, I am. [Tony looks up and it's the woman he bumped into outsid the bar] [suddenly Brandt grabs hold of Tony's arm and twists it, slamming his head onto the table, Tony manages to quickly grab hold of Chad's dog tags that were on the table]

Rose Hills Sheriff: Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about? What the hell's going on here?

Brandt: It's called an arrest. [she pushes Tony to the ground and steps towards the Sheriff] Sheriff, is it?

Rose Hills Sheriff: Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?

Brandt: Homeland Security. [she holds up her badge] We good here?

Rose Hills Sheriff: No, we're not good. I need a little more information than that.

Brandt: Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.

Rose Hills Sheriff: Yeah, well, why don't you get on the horn to Nashville and uh...upgrade me? [Tony gestures to Mrs. Davis to hide the file, she pushes it under the bar]

Brandt: Alright, you know what? I was hoping to do this the smart way, but uh...the fun way's always good. [Tony notices her hand turning red hot, burning the badge in her hand]

Rose Hills Sheriff: Deputy, get this woman and... [suddenly Brandt shoves the hot badge into the Sheriff's face, she takes his gun and shoots him, Tony runs out of the bar and Brandt follows him, he turns to her]

Tony Stark: Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go. [as Tony turns to run again he sees Savin getting out of a car and walk towards him, as Savin gets his gun out to shoot at him, Tony runs off and Harley throws something at Savin to make him miss Tony, Tony stops behind a car and sees a man hiding low on the ground] Crazy, huh?

Rose Hill Christmas Tree Shopper: Yeah.

Tony Stark: Watch this. [Tony smashes into the window of a shop] [as Tony and Brandt are fighting in the shop, Tony starts a fire in shop] You walked right into this one, I've dated hotter chicks than you. [Tony puts Chad's dog tags into the microwave and he turns on the gas]

Brandt: That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?

Tony Stark: Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography. [Tony quickly leaves through the back door, as the dog tags heat up in the microwave they start sparking up fire, Brandt realizes the gas has been left on and suddenly the shop explodes killing Brandt] [Tony stumbles out of the shop as people run past. A watertank falls down and traps Tony's leg. He finds that Savin has grabbed Harley]

Harley Keener: Let me go! [Savin mocks Harley]

Savin: Help me! Help me! [as Tony's leg is trapped under some rubble, Savin sits in front of him with Harley sat on his lap] Hey kid, what would you like for Christmas?

Harley Keener: Mr. Stark, I am so sorry!

Savin: Oh. No, no. I think he was trying to say, "I want my god damn file."

Tony Stark: It's not your fault, kid. Remember what I told you about bullies. [Harley uses the gadget Tony gave him earlier and runs away] Do you like that, Westworld? That's the thing about smart guys, we always cover our ass. [Tony brings up his hand and reveals his Iron Man suit hand. He fires at Savin and sends him flying backwards. Tony makes his way out of the rubble before leaving.]

Harley Keener: You're welcome

Tony Stark: For what? Did I miss something?

Harley Keener: Me saving your life

Tony Stark: Yeah. A, saved you first. B, thanks, sort of. And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz, alright? Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose.

Harley Keener: Unlike you? Admit it, you need me. We're connected.

Tony Stark: What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up. Okay, can you feel that? We're done here. Move it out the way or I'm going to run you over. Bye kid. [Tony gets in his car] I'm sorry, kid, you did good.

Harley Keener: So now you're just going to leave me here, like my dad?

Tony Stark: Yep [A beat] Wait, you're guilt tripping me, aren't you?

Harley Keener: [Childishly] I'm cold.

Tony Stark: [Mocking him] I can tell. You know how I can tell? Cus we're connected. [Tony drives away]

Harley Keener: It was worth a shot.

[Savin wakes up, coughing and healed from Extremis. His face glows red.] [During an advert, the Mandarin takes over the satellite.]

Government Employee: Mr Vice President, I think you should see this.

Vice President: Oh god, not again. Is the President getting this?

[On a plane, the President looks at a TV is shock.]

The Mandarin: Mr President. Only two lessons remain and I intend to finish this before Christmas morning. Meet Thomas Richards. [The screen zooms out to show a man lying on the floor while Mandarin points a gun at him] Good strong name. Good strong job. Thomas, here, is an accountant for the Roxxon Oil Corporation. [Thomas sobs] But I'm sure he's a really good guy. I'm going to shoot him in the head, live on your television in 30 seconds.

Thomas Richards: No!

The Mandarin: The number for this telephone is in your cell phone. Exciting, isn't it, imagining how it got there? America, if your president calls me in the next half-minute, Tom lives. Go!

Government Official #1: How did he hack my phone?

Government Official #2: We can't allow terrorists to dictate...

President Ellis: I have to make this call.

Government Official #2: I'd strongly advise against that.

President Ellis: This is the right thing to do. [The phone rings but Mandarin doesn't answer. He waits for a few seconds before firing the gun.]

The Mandarin: There's just one lesson left, President Ellis. So run away, hide, kiss your children goodbye. Because nothing, not your army, not your red, white and blue attack dog, can save you. I'll see you soon.

President Ellis: Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic right now.

Military Aide: Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal. We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan and the Patriot is ready to strike.

President Ellis: Right now.

Military Aide: Yes, sir.

(Tony Stark is reading over some files in a car. He sighs.)

Tony Stark: Man. Happy, Happy, Happy-

(Rhodey, suited in his Iron Patriot armor, kicks down a door & marches forwards.)

Rhodey: Don't move! (His phone rings.) Uh... Hang on a second. Hello?

Tony Stark: You ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?

Rhodey: Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?

Tony Stark: It's me, pal. Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me. What are you doing?

Rhodey: A little knock-and-talk, making friends in Pakistan. What are you doing?

Tony Stark: Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?

Rhodey: Yeah.

Tony Stark: I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login.

Rhodey: It's the same as it's always been, "WarMachine68."

Tony Stark: And password, please.

Rhodey: Well, look, I gotta change it every time you hack in, Tony.

Tony Stark: It's not the '80s, nobody says "hack" any more. Give me your login. (Rhodey sighs.)

Rhodey: "WAR MACHINE ROX" with an "X," all caps.

Tony Stark: (He's laughing.) That is so much better than "lron Patriot."

EMCEE: Very nice. Very nice. I have one question for you. What would you like for Christmas this year?

Elk Ridge: Well, David...

Crew: Do not erase a programme from my DVR unless you are 100% sure...

EMCEE: One more time! Ms Elk Ridge, everybody! All right.

Cameraman: Because you erase my shows!

Tony Stark: That ain't gonna cut it.

Cameraman: We talked about this. Excuse me, sir. I don't know who... (Tony turns around.)

Tony Stark: Shh.

Cameraman: Mom, I need to call you back. Something magical is happening. Tony Stark is in my van.

Tony Stark: Shh. Keep it down.

Cameraman: Tony Stark is in my van!

Tony Stark: No, he's not.

Cameraman: I knew you were still alive!

Tony Stark: Come on in. Close the door. (The cameraman gets in the van & closes the door.) Shh...

Cameraman: Oh, wow. Can I just say, sir...

Tony Stark: Yep.

Cameraman: I am your biggest fan.

Tony Stark: Okay. First, is this your van? Is anyone else gonna come in?

Cameraman: No, no, no. Just us.

Tony Stark: Great. What's your name?

Cameraman: Gary

Tony Stark: Gary?

Gary: Oh, wow.

Tony Stark: Right there is fine.

Gary: Okay.

Tony Stark: Okay? I get a lot of this, it's okay.

Gary: Oh, good. Can I just say?

Tony Stark: What do you want?

Gary: Yeah. I don't know if you can tell, but I have, like, patterned my whole look after you. My hair's a little...

Tony Stark: It's fine.

Gary: It's not right, 'cause there's no product in it.

Tony Stark: Right.

Gary: I don't want to make things awkward for you, but I do have to show you... Boom!

Tony Stark: A Hispanic Scott Baio. I'm sorry. Is that me?

Gary: Yeah. It's... I mean... I had them do it off a doll that I made, so it's not like it's off a picture. So it's a little bit...

Tony Stark: Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%.

Gary: Got it.

Tony Stark: All right? It's a mission.

Gary: Yeah.

Tony Stark: Tony needs Gary.

Gary: And Gary needs Tony.

Tony Stark: Be quiet about it. Go.

Gary: Yeah.

(Tony types on the keyboard & accesses the files he needs. A video starts playing.)

Aldrich Killian: What would you regard as the defining moment of your life?

Chad Davis: Well, uh, I think that would be the day I decided not to let my injury beat me. (Tony types again and another video shows up.)

Aldrich Killian: Will you please state your name for the camera?

Brandt: Ellen Brandt.

Aldrich Killian: Okay. So, the injections are administered periodically. Addiction will not be tolerated. And those who cannot regulate will be out from the programme. (More typing, another video.) Once misfits, cripples... You are the next iteration of human evolution. Everybody, before we start... I promise you, looking back at your life, there will be nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious risk you prudently elected to forego. Today is your glory- Let's begin. (Brandt's missing arm grows back as she glows red. The other volunteers glow red & scream too.) We gotta get out of here! We gotta get out of here! Get her out! Get them out of here! (One of the volunteers exploads.)

Tony Stark: (He's muttering.) A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire. The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal? It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you? Sold it to the Mandarin. Got you, pal.

(Pepper and Maya are in a bedroom talking.)

Maya Hansen: What happened? Fun fact. Before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Wernher von Braun dreamed of space travel. He stargazed. Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London? "The rocket performed perfectly. It just landed on the wrong planet." See, we all begin wide-eyed. Pure science. And then the ego steps in, the obsession. And you look up, you're a long way from shore.

Pepper Potts: You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I mean, you gave your research to a think tank.

Maya Hansen: Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts.

Pepper Potts: That's exactly what we used to do. So, don't judge yourself.

Maya Hansen: Thank you, Pepper. I really appreciate that. (Someone knocks on the door & Pepper looks over. She gets up & opens the door. Room service pushes in a tray of food but Killain appears & snaps his neck. Pepper gasps.)

Pepper Potts: Maya, run! [Killian grabs Pepper by the arm, spins her around and slams her against the wall, holding her by the neck.

Aldrich Killian: Hi, Pepper. (To Maya) So, you want to tell me why you were at Stark's mansion last night?

Maya Hansen: I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you and the master were gonna blow the place up.

Aldrich Killian: Oh, I see. So, you were trying to save Stark when he threatened us?

Maya Hansen: I've told you, Killian, we can use him.

Aldrich Killian: Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.

Maya Hansen: Look, if we want to launch product next year, I need Stark. He just lacked a decent incentive. Now, he has one.

[Rhodey flies across the sky in his Iron Patriot armor.]

Man: [On radio] This is support team Blue-Zero. Sending coordinates for a suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.

Rhodey: Copy. [Repulsor firing, people shrieking] Nobody move. [Women exclaiming in fear] Oh. Support Blue-Zero, unless the Mandarin's next attack on the U.S. involves cheaply-made sportswear, I think you messed up again. Yes, you're free, uh, if you weren't before. It's... Of course. Yes, ma'am. Iron Patriot on the job. Happy to help. No need to thank me, ma'am. It's my pleasure. [One of the women shakes Rhodey's hand and her hand glows red. Rhodey falls backwards, grunting.]

Woman: Savin? I've acquired the Patriot armour.

Rhodey: If you want this suit, you're going to have to pry my cold dead body out of it.

Woman: That's the plan, Colonel.

Tony Stark: Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report.

Harley Keener: Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?

Tony Stark: How much have you had?

Harley Keener: Two or three bowls.

Tony Stark: Can you still see straight?

Harley Keener: Sort of.

Tony Stark: That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?

JARVIS: It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.

Tony Stark: What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?

JARVIS: Actually, sir, it's in Miami.

Tony Stark: Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.

Harley Keener: Um, it does say Miami, Florida.

Tony Stark: Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?

Harley Keener: Uh, it's not charging. [Tony pulls over to the side of the road, heavy breathing]

JARVIS: Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable. It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42.

Tony Stark: What's questionable about electricity? All right? It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna... [Breathing heavily] Oh, God, not again.

Harley Keener: Tony? [Tony gets out of the car] Are you having another attack? I didn't even mention New York.

Tony Stark: Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.

Harley Keener: Okay, um, uh...

Tony Stark: [Panting] God, what am I gonna do?

Harley Keener: Just breathe. Really, just breathe. You're a mechanic, right?

Tony Stark: Right.

Harley Keener: You said so.

Tony Stark: Yes, I did.

Harley Keener: Why don't you just build something?

Tony Stark: Okay. Thanks, kid. [He gets back in the car.] [Cut to Tony in a shop buying supplies.] [Cut to Tony building something.] [Cut to Miama, Florida. Tony climbs a wall and begins fighting guards. He makes his way into the house and finds a woman lying on a table.] [Cut to a different woman lying on a sofa with a man sitting at a desk.]

Woman: Why is it so hot in here? I told you to put it at 68.

Man: [Scoffs] My fault again. Let me tell you something, sweetheart. I am not your personal air con... [Tony puts a gloved hand on his head, electrocuting him. He gets the gun and leaves the room. He makes his way to the bedroom and pulls the duvet off the bed, revealling two girls. Tony sushes them and the toilet flushes.]

The Mandarin: Well, I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes. [He laughs] Now, which one of you is Vanessa?

Vanessa: That's me.

The Mandarin: Ah! Nessie. Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?

Vanessa: There's some guy over here.

The Mandarin: They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe.

Tony Stark: Hey! [Mandarin raises his hands]

The Mandarin: Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

Tony Stark: Don't move.

The Mandarin: I'm not moving. You want something? Take it. Although the guns are all fake because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.

Tony Stark: What?

The Mandarin: Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?

Tony Stark: Heard enough. You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy. Where? Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?

The Mandarin: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's here. He's here, but he's not here. He's here, but he's not here.

Tony Stark: What do you mean?

The Mandarin: It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated.

Tony Stark: It is?

The Mandarin: It's complicated.

Tony Stark: Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out. Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom. Sit. [Door closes. Gunshot. Women exclaim in fear]

The Mandarin: My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

Tony Stark: What are you? What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?

Trevor Slattery: What, you mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not. [Tony points the gun at Trevor's face] Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.

Tony Stark: You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.

Trevor Slattery: It's just a role. "The Mandarin," see, it's not real.

Tony Stark: Then how did you get here, Trevor?

Trevor Slattery: Um. Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances. And I ended up, um, doing things, no two ways about it, in the street, that a man shouldn't do.

Tony Stark: Next?

Trevor Slattery: Then, they approached me about the role, and they knew about the drugs.

Tony Stark: What did they say? They'd get you off them?

Trevor Slattery: They said they'd give me more. They gave me things. They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things. [Snoring]

Tony Stark: Did you just nod off? Hey. [Tony kicks him]

Trevor Slattery: No, and a lovely speedboat. And the thing was, he needed someone to take credit for some accidental explosions. [Mimic explosion]

Tony Stark: "He"? Killian?

Trevor Slattery: Killian.

Tony Stark: He created you?

Trevor Slattery: He created me.

Tony Stark: Custom-made terror threat.

Trevor Slattery: Yes. Yes. His think tank thinked it up. The pathology of a serial killer. The manipulation of Western iconography. Ready for another lesson? Blah, blah, blah. No. Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life.

Tony Stark: Your performance? Where people died?

Trevor Slattery: No, they didn't. Look around you. The costumes, green screen. Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff. And when I was, it was movie magic, love.

Tony Stark: I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up. So you're gonna have to answer for that. You're still going down, pal. You under... [Savin hits Tony around the head, unconcious]

Savin: Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?

Trevor Slattery: I didn't tell him anything.

Savin: Nothing?

Trevor Slattery: No.

Savin: You should have pressed the panic button.

Trevor Slattery: Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.

Tony Stark: Ah... [Sighs] Okay.

Maya Hansen: It's just like old times, huh?

Tony Stark: Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.

Maya Hansen: It wasn't my idea.

Tony Stark: Okay. So you took Killian's card.

Maya Hansen: I took his money.

Tony Stark: And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.

Maya Hansen: No.

Tony Stark: Yeah.

Maya Hansen: No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.

Tony Stark: Yeah?

Maya Hansen: [Sighs and walks towards him] A lot has happened, Tony. But I'm close. Extremis is practically stabilised.

Tony Stark: [Shouting] I'm telling you it isn't. [Lowers voice to usual volume] I'm on the street. People are going bang. They're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.

Maya Hansen: Then help me fix it. [She shows him the "You Know Who I Am" note he left in 1999.]

Tony Stark: Did I do that?

Maya Hansen: Yes.

Tony Stark: I remember the night, not the morning. Is this what you've been chasing around?

Maya Hansen: You don't remember?

Tony Stark: I can't help you. You used to have a moral psychology. You used to have ideals. You wanted to help people. Now look at you. I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul. Get me out of here. Come on.

Aldrich Killian: You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favourite of many sayings... "The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese."

Tony Stark: You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?

Aldrich Killian: How can I be pissed at you, Tony? I'm here to thank you. You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me. Desperation. If you think back to Switzerland, you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right? Well, for the first 20 minutes, I actually thought you'd show up. And the next hour... I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby. If you know what I mean.

Tony Stark: Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.

Aldrich Killian: But as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come. Anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since. Right? You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target.

Tony Stark: You're something else.

Aldrich Killian: You have met him, I assume?

Tony Stark: Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.

Aldrich Killian: I know he's a little over the top sometimes. It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden... He's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is. Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day.

Tony Stark: What's next for you in your world?

Aldrich Killian: Well, I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift that you so graciously imparted to me. [Killian rolls three balls forwards and they stop, projecting an image of Pepper. She has Extremis.] Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment the body is trying to decide whether to accept Extremis or just give up. And if it gives up, I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular. But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain. We haven't even talked salary yet. What kind of perk package are you thinking of?

Maya Hansen: Let him go.

Aldrich Killian: Hold on, hold on. Maya...

Maya Hansen: I said, let him go.

Aldrich Killian: What are you doing?

Maya Hansen: 1200 CCs. A dose half of this size, I'm dead.

Aldrich Killian: It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat. Maya, give me the injector.

Maya Hansen: If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?

Aldrich Killian: We're not doing this, okay?

Maya Hansen: What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot? [He looks back at Tony and shoots Maya]

Aldrich Killian: The good news is, a high-level position has just been vacated.

Tony Stark: You are a maniac.

Aldrich Killian: No, I'm a visionary. But I do own a maniac. And he takes the stage tonight. [Killian leaves and talks to Savin] Once we get the Patriot installed, it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.

Savin: Well, that's great, but the last time I looked there was somebody inside of it. [Whirring]

Aldrich Killian: Afternoon, gentlemen. [Whirring ceases] Hello, Colonel. Step aside. [Killian places his hand on the suit and it blows orange.] Oh! We'll get you out of there. Don't worry.

Savin: You'll damage the armour.

Aldrich Killian: Yes, I will. But you can fix it, right? I'm gonna take the Chinook to base camp. And I want Potts with me.

Savin: She's still in Phase Two.

Aldrich Killian: You're not going deaf, are you?

Tony Stark: [Watch beeping.] Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?

Guard #1: 832 miles.

Tony Stark: Very nice.

Guard #1: I'm good like that. Can you, uh, stop that?

Tony Stark: Break it, you bought it.

Guard #2: I think I bought it.

Tony Stark: Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister. And that's why I'm gonna kill you first.

Guard #2: What are you gonna do to me?

Tony Stark: You'll see.

Guard #2: You're zip-tied to a bed. This. [Nothing happens.] That. [Nothing happens again]

Alrich Killian: Are you coming out?

Rhodey: [Panting and sweating] Do not open. Do not open. Don't open. Don't open. [Beeping.] All right. Let's go. [The suit opens, Rhodey jumps and punches Savin in the face, then kicks him. Killian glows red and breathes fire at Rhodey.] You... You breathe fire? Okay. [Savin knocks Rhodey unconcious.]

Aldrich Killian: It's a glorious day, Savin. This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand, and the world's most feared terrorist in the other. I'll own the war on terror. Create supply and demand. For you, for your brothers and sisters.

Tony Stark: Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two...

Guard #2: How did we get this shift?

Tony Stark: All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!

Guard #2: Wow. That was...

Tony Stark: You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.

Guard #2: I am just beyond terrified.

Tony Stark: Here it comes. Three, four...

Guard #2: Shut up.

Tony Stark: [Quickly] Five, four, three, two, one! [The Iron Man suit joins to his left arm] Told you. Where's the rest? [He blasts one of the men and unties himself. As they fight, the suit connects to his rigth leg and he kicks them] Where's the rest? [Meanwhile, Harley watches as the garage door shakes. He runs over and blows it open. The suit flies out.] [Repulsor powering up, gunfire, screaming.]

Man: Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird. [Tony leaves.]

Tony Stark: Ah! Better late than never. [He gets outside and catches the face mask.] Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way.

JARVIS: Oh, hello, sir.

Guard: [Beeping, Rhodey wakes up.] All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound. Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.

Tony Stark: Ah! Let's go! [Thrusters misfiring.] Aw, crap.

Rhodey: Tony?

Tony Stark: Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit.

Rhodey: No. You got yours'?

Tony Stark: Uh... Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet.

Rhodey: You, you, you! Move! Get out!

Tony Stark: [Girls whimpering] The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.

Rhodey: What's this? I had winners. [Gunshots. Trevor wakes up and begins drinking beer again.]

Tony Stark: What have you come as?

Rhodey: You make a move, and I break your face.

Tony Stark:I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.

Rhodey: This is the Mandarin?

Tony Stark:Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.

Trevor Slattery: Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery. I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that. But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on.

Tony Stark:Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.

Rhodey: You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.

Trevor Slattery: Doing what? Ow, I get it! Ow! That hurt. I get it! I get it! I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan.

Tony Stark: Spill.

Rhodey: Do you know what they did to my suit?

Tony Stark: What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there.

Trevor Slattery: Woah! [Rhodey jumps.] Ole', ole', ole', ole'...

Rhodey: Tony, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off.

Tony Stark: Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?

Rhodey: Yeah, a little bit.

Tony Stark: So?

Rhodey: What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport.

Tony Stark: Right. [Beer opens] Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a "lovely speedboat"? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

Rhodey: But we also have to figure out this vice president thing, right?

Tony Stark: Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president.

Vice President: Thanks. Hello?

Tony Stark: Sir, this is Tony Stark.

Vice President: Welcome back to the land of the living.

Tony Stark: We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.

Vice President: Mr Stark, I'm about to eat honey-roast ham, surrounded by the Agency's finest. The president's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes. I think we're good, here.

Rhodey: Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes. They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan horse. They're gonna take out the president somehow. We have to immediately alert that plane.

Vice President: Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down. If need be, they can have F-22s in the air in 30 seconds. Thank you, Colonel.

Rhodey: Rhodes and Stark out.

Man: Everything okay, sir?

Vice President: Couldn't be better. (To his daughter) I love you, babe.

[The Iron Patriot lands and walks towards President Ellis]

President Ellis: Colonel Rhodes. [Salutes] Glad to see you could make it, son. I feel safer already.

Rhodey: We gotta make a decision. We can either save the president, or Pepper. We can't do both.

JARVIS: Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have finally arrived, and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.

Tony Stark: And what about the suit I'm wearing?

JARVIS: The armour is now at 92%.

Tony Stark: That's going to have to do.

[The Iron Patient's arm opens and the suit wearer puts their hand against the door handle on a plane, burning it.]

Military Aide: Everything all right, Colonel? [Iron Patriot kills the aide and people begin shooting at him. He kills everyone beside the President. The helmet lifts up to reveal Savin.

Savin: It is an honour, Mr President.

President Ellis: If you're gonna do it, do it!

Savin: Whoa! Cool your boots, sir. That's not how the Mandarin works.

Officer: Sir, Air Force One has been compromised. Internal shots, temperature spikes.

Officer #2: Get me eyes on it now.

Officer: Image coming through now, sir.

Officer #2: Was that Rhodes?

Man: Is anyone there?

Woman: Let us out! [Tony attacks Savin and pins him against the wall.]

Tony Stark: The President. Now.

Savin: He's not here. [Savin burns the Iron Man suit's arm. Electrical crackling, mechanisms grinding, soft groaning.] Try the jet stream? Speaking of which, go fish. [A door blasts open on the plane, people screaming, metal creaking, more screaming. Tony blasts Savin in the chest.]

Tony Stark: Walk away from that, you son of a bitch. [Savin falls to the ground.] How many in the air?

JARVIS: Thirteen, sir.

Tony Stark: How many can I carry?

JARVIS: Four, sir.

Tony Stark: Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather?

Heather: [Screaming] Oh, God! No! No!

Tony Stark: Listen to me. See that guy? I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him. You got it?

Heather: What? Oh!

Tony Stark: I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand. We can do this, Heather. Easy, see? Eleven more to go. Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys? That's what we're going to do.

JARVIS: 18,000 feet.

Tony Stark: Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey. Nice.

JARVIS: 10,000 feet. 6,000 feet.

Tony Stark: Come on, people. Come on, come on, come on! Yeah!

JARVIS: 1, 000 feet. 400 feet. 200 feet, sir.

Tony Stark: He's a chunky monkey, let's get him. Hello. [Tony drops them all in the water from a few feet above.]

Man: We made it!

Tony Stark: Nice work, guys! Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us. All right, Jarvis. But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper... [The Iron Man suit flies into a truck and the suit disassembles. He sighs.] That came out of nowhere. Wow [We now see Tony on the boat, where he was controlling the suit.]

Rhodey: Give me some good news, man.

Tony Stark: I think they all made it.

Rhodey: Oh, thank God.

Tony Stark: Yeah, but I missed the president.

Rhodey: You couldn't save the president with the suit, how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?

Tony Stark: Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?

JARVIS: The House Party Protocol, sir?

Tony Stark: Correct.

Aldrich Killian: [Pepper wakes up and gasps.] Hi.

Pepper Potts: [Breathing heavily.] You think he's gonna help you? He won't.

Aldrich Killian: Having you here is not just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um... Well, it's actually more embarrassing than that. You're here as my, um...

Pepper Potts: Trophy

Aldrich Killian: [Chuckles.] Mmm. [Iron Patriot walks in and Pepper gasps.] Good evening, sir. [The armor opens and the President falls out.] Welcome aboard, Mr President. Ever hear of an elephant graveyard? Well, two years ago, the elephant in the room was this scow.

President Ellis: This is the Roxxon Norco.

Aldrich Killian:And, of course, you'll remember that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola, thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court.

President Ellis: What do you want from me?

Aldrich Killian: Uh, nothing, sir. I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV. You see, I've moved on. I found myself a new political patron, and this time tomorrow, he'll have your job. String him up.

President Ellis: Hey!

Rhodey: [Climbs on to the boat.] Come on. You're not gonna freak out on me, right?

Tony Stark: I hope not.

Rhodey: Oh, my God. [Sighs] He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.

Tony Stark: Viking funeral. Public execution.

Rhodey: Yeah, death by oil.

Announcer: (On PA) Broadcast will commence shortly. Take final positions.

Aldrich Killian: Okay. That's good. Now give me cameras A through E and we'll do a full tech rehearsal. (Technician typing)

Rhodey: ls your gun up?

Tony Stark: Yep. What do I do?

Rhodey: Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back.

Tony Stark: Six, high, back. Alright. [Gunfire, bullets ricocheting] You see that? Nailed it.

Rhodey: Yeah, you really killed the glass.

Tony Stark: You think I was aiming for the bulb? You can't hit a bulb at this distance. [Rhodey fires a bullet and hits the bulb.]

Announcer: [On PA] All personnel, we have hostiles on east unit 12.

Man: Over there!

Announcer: [On PA] I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.

Tony Stark: I'm out. Give me. You got extra magazines?

Rhodey: They're not universal, Tony.

Tony Stark: I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one.

Rhodey: Okay

Tony Stark: Give me one of yours.

Rhodey: I don't have one that fits that gun.

Tony Stark: You've got, like, five of them. Here's what I'm going to do. Save my spot, ready?

Rhodey: What'd you see?

Tony Stark: Too fast. Nothing. Here we go. [Clears throat] Three guys, one girl, all armed.

Rhodey: God, I would kill for some armour right now.

Tony Stark: You're right. We need backup.

Rhodey: Yeah, a bunch.

Tony Stark: You know what? [He nods at something in the distance, whooshing]

Rhodey: Is that...?

Tony Stark: Yep.

Rhodey: Are those...?

Tony Stark: Yeah. [Dozens of Iron Man suits fly over.] Merry Christmas, buddy. JARVIS, target Extremis heat signatures. Disable with extreme prejudice.

JARVIS: [Through armors] Yes, sir.

Tony Stark: What are you waiting for? It's Christmas. Take them to church.

JARVIS: Gentlemen. [Grunting, screaming.]

Tony Stark: Incoming! Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing. [Mechanisms whirring.]

Rhodey: This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?

Tony Stark: Everybody needs a hobby. Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you? [Tony suits up.] Nice timing.

Rhodey: Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?

Tony Stark: Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.

Rhodey: What does that mean?

Tony Stark: I got you covered.

JARVIS: Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?

Rhodey: Very funny.

JARVIS: Sir, I've located Ms Potts.

Tony Stark: About time.

Pepper Potts: [Gasps, panting.] Stop! Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.

Tony Stark: See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?

Pepper Potts: You're such a jerk.

Tony Stark: Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner. [Metal creaking, Pepper sobbing.] Come on. A little more, baby. [Pepper straining, Tony grunting. Killian shoves his hand on Tony's suit, burning it.]

Aldrich Killian: Is this guy bothering you? Don't get up. Ooh. Is it hot in there? [Sizzling.] Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck? Like a little turtle, cooking in his little turtle suit.

Pepper Potts: Tony.

Aldrich Killian: She's watching. I think you should close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You don't want to see this. [Tony cuts off Killian's arm, it burns through the floor and Pepper falls down.]

Tony Stark: Yeah, you take a minute. [Groaning, sizzling, metal creaking, yelling, grunts, Pepper whimpers.] Jarvis, give me a suit right now! [The suit he called gets destroyed.] Oh, come on!

Rhodey: Mr President! Just hold on, all right? I'm coming. Just hold on. Hold on. [Gunfire] Oh, kay. Bye-bye. Brace yourself. You look damn good, Mr President, but I'm gonna need that suit back. The President is secure, Tony. I'm clearing the area.

Tony Stark: Nice work.

Rhodey: Ready, sir?

President Ellis: What do you mean "ready"? [Rhodey blasts off and the President screams.]

Tony Stark: Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me! Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there. All right? You've got to let go. You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise. No! [Pepper falls to the ground and into the flames below.]

Aldrich Killian: A shame. I would've caught her. [Tony and Killian run towards each other. Killian jumps up to attack, Tony slides under and armors up. Repulsors firing, flesh burning, both grunting.]

Tony Stark: Eject. [More repulsors firing.]

Aldrich Killian: Well, here we are on the roof. [Killian slices the suit in half.]

JARVIS: Mark 42, inbound.

Tony Stark: I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns. [The suit flies to Tony, hits a piece of metal and falls apart. Rolls his eyes.] Whatever.

Aldrich Killian: You really didn't deserve her, Tony. It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect.

Tony Stark: Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect. [Tony motions to the suit and it flies on to Killian.] Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42.

Aldrich Killian: [Muffled screaming.] No! [He walks towards Tony, his flesh held together by flames.] No more false faces. You said you wanted the Mandarin. You're looking right at him. It was always me, Tony. Right from the start. I am the Mandarin! [Someone hits Killian and he flies to the side. It's Pepper. Heavy breathing.]

Tony Stark: I got nothing. [Repulsor powering up.] Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage! What? Oh, what, are you mad at me? [Pepper runs towards Tony, flips in the air, punches through the Iron Man suit and destroys it. She uses the suit to blow up Killian.] Honey?

Pepper Potts: Oh, my God. That was really violent.

Tony Stark: You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...

Pepper Potts: I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet? Who's the hot mess now?

Tony Stark: It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal.

Pepper Potts: You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits. What am I going to complain about now?

Tony Stark: Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here.

Pepper Potts: No, don't touch me.

Tony Stark: Don't worry about it.

Pepper Potts: No, I'm gonna burn you.

Tony Stark: No, you're not. Not hot.

Pepper Potts: Am I gonna be okay?

Tony Stark: No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff.

Pepper Potts: And all your distractions?

Tony Stark: Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey.

JARVIS: All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?

Tony Stark: You know what to do.

JARVIS: The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?

Tony Stark: Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes. [Pepper and Tony hug as the Iron Man suits blow up.] Okay, so far? Do you like it?

Pepper Potts: It'll do.

Tony Stark (V.O): And so, as Christmas morning began, my journey had reached its end. You start with something pure, something exciting. Then, come the mistakes. The compromises. We create our own demons.

Trevor Slattery: Oh! Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!

Tony Stark (V.O): But then I thought to myself, "Why stop there?" Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous, but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel. And now, neither will I. Let me tell you,[Metal clinking.] that was the best sleep I'd had in years.

Nurse: [Happy wakes up, gasping and coughing.] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

Happy Hogan: [Weak] No, look.

Tony Stark (V.O): [Throws Arc Reactor into the ocean.] So, if I were to wrap this up, tie it with a bow, or whatever... I guess I'd say my armor, it was never a distraction, or a hobby. It was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys. One thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man. [Thrilling music playing, credit scene.] You know, and thank you by the way. For listening. Plus, something about just getting it off my chest, and putting it out there in the atmosphere, instead of holding this in... I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know. Wow, I had no idea you were such a good listener.

Tony Stark: To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle. [The camera zooms out to show Bruce Banner, asleep.] And the fact that you've been able to -help me process... [Tony stops and looks over as Bruce rubs his eyes.] Are you with me?

Bruce Banner: Sorry... I was, yeah. We were at, uh...

Tony Stark: Are you actively napping?

Bruce Banner: [Stammering] I was... I... I drifted.

Tony Stark: Where did I lose you?

Bruce Banner: Elevator in Switzerland.

Tony Stark: So, you heard none of it?

Bruce Banner: I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm not a therapist. It's not my training.

Tony Stark: So?

Bruce Banner: I don't have the...

Tony Stark: What? The time?

Bruce Banner: Temperament.

Tony Stark: You know what? Now that I think about it... Oh! God, my original wound. 1983, all right?

Bruce Banner: Yes.

Tony Stark: I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird.[Adrian Toomes and his coworker, Phineas Mason, are studying a child's drawing of the Avengers.]

Toomes: Things are never gonna be the same now. I mean, look at this. You got aliens. You got big green guys tearing down buildings. When I was a kid, I used to draw cowboys and Indians.

Mason: Actually, it's Native American, but whatever.

Toomes: Yeah. Tell you what, though. It ain't bad, is it?

[Toomes squints at the drawing and Mason nods.]

Mason: No. Yeah. Kid's got a future.

Toomes: Yeah, well... We'll see, I guess.

[Toomes looks up at the damaged Avengers Tower. Helicopters pass overhead. Scaffolding covers the tower's lower floors. A roving view sends us into a ruined building across the street.]
[A clean-up crew works around a giant deceased Chitauri alien creature with pointed teeth. Alien artifacts lie among the rubble. Walking through the site, Toomes gives a worker a thumbs up. He turns to Herman Schultz, who is one of his workers.]

Toomes: No, hey! Uh-uh! You can't saw through that stuff. These alien bastards are tough. You gotta use the stuff they use.

[He picks up an alien object from the ground and uses it as a tool to break down the Chitauri chariot.]

Toomes: See?

Schultz: All right.

Toomes: All right. (to Brice) Oh, hey! Glad you could join us. Afternoon.

Brice: Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.

Toomes: Yeah, yeah, yeah, your alarm. Look, just go stack that armor plating like I asked you. This is a huge deal for us.

[Anne Marie Hoag, the director of the Department of Damage Control, walks into the salvage site with her crew.]

Anne Marie Hoag: Attention, please! In accordance with Executive Order 396B, all post-battle cleanup operations are now under our jurisdiction. Thank you for your service. We'll take it from here.

Toomes: Who the hell are you?

DODC Agent: Qualified personnel.

Toomes: Look, I have a city contract to salvage all this, okay, with the city, so-

Anne Marie Hoag: I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage operations are now under our jurisdiction. Please turn over any and all exotic materials that you've collected, or you will be prosecuted.

[The workers look puzzled. A worker slips an alien artifact that looks like a power source into his pocket unnoticed.]

Toomes: Ma'am, what am I- Please. Come here. Hey, lady, come on. Look... I bought trucks for this job. I brought in a whole new crew. These guys have a family. I have a family. I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.

Anne Marie Hoag: I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.

[Toomes is left to stare at her back as she leaves. Behind him, a Damage Control Agent speaks up.]

DODC Agent: Maybe next time, don't over extend yourself.

[Toomes looks around and grins.]

Toomes: What'd you say?

[He looks around at his crew of workers. Brice whistles.]

Toomes: Yeah, he's right. I overextended myself.

[Suddenly, he punches the agent. The agents point their guns at him.]

Worker: Don't do it.

Anne Marie Hoag: Put them down.

[The agents lower their guns.]

Anne Marie Hoag: If you have a grievance, you may take it up with my superiors.

Toomes: Your superiors. Who the hell are they?

[We see a TV screen playing the news about Tony Stark and his contract with Damage Control. Toomes watches the TV with an angry look on his face.]

News Anchor: A joint venture between Stark Industries and the federal government, the Department of Damage Control will oversee the collection and storage of alien and other exotic materials.

Schultz: So now the assholes who made this mess are being paid to clean it up.

Mason: Yeah, it’s all rigged.

[Mason is tinkering with the alien power source that one of the workers stole from the salvage site earlier that day.]

News Anchor: Experts estimate there are over fifteen hundred tons of exotic material scattered throughout the tri-state area.

[The glowing alien artifact is now connected to a motor with wires. The blades on the motor start to spin and the machine floats off the table. One of the workers pulls off a tarpaulin sheet covering a large piece of Chitauri artifact, revealing a dozen of glowing Chitauri energy cores.]

Worker: Hey, chief! We still have another load from yesterday. We’re supposed to turn this in, right?

Brice: I ain’t hauling it.

Mason: It’s too bad. We could have made some pretty cool stuff from all that alien junk.

[Toomes stares at the truck full of alien items and makes up his mind.]

Toomes: I tell you what, let’s keep it. The world’s changing.

[Mason lifts his magnifying goggles and looks at his boss.]

Toomes: It’s time we change, too.

8 YEARS LATER

[The Rolling Stones’ “Can’t You Hear Me Knocking” is playing in the warehouse. Workers are moving piles of alien tech and tinkering with machines. Mason works on an elaborate rifle gun. Another worker fires a neon blast from an exotic gun. The blast shears a large item in half. Workers load piles of high tech weapons onto a van.]

[Cash pours through a money counting machine.]

[A figure wearing a flying suit with expensive metal wings soars toward the warehouse. Doors in the ceiling open and the figure drops crates of alien tech from the suits’ claw-like feet. The helmeted figure comes through the roof and lands on the platform. He steps out of the wing suit and faces Mason.]

Toomes: There you go, Mason.

[The helmet opens, revealing Toomes. Mason grins.]

Toomes: Business is good.

a Film by Peter Parker

[Through a small, rectangular screen, we see the scenery of New York passing by at a high velocity. We seem to be on a highway.]

Peter: (in a gravelly voice) New York. Queens. It’s a rough borough, but hey, it’s home.

Happy: Who are you talking to?

[Camera quickly pans to reveal Happy Hogan driving in the front seat.]

Peter: (in a normal voice) No one. Just making a little video of the trip.

Happy: You know you can’t show it to anyone.

Peter: Yeah, I know.

Happy: Then why are you narrating in that voice?

Peter: Uh... Because it’s fun.

Happy: Fun.

[Apparently, Happy thinks this whole situation is the opposite of fun. He puts on his sunglasses and solemnly looks out the windshield.]

Peter: So, uh, why do they call you Happy?

[Happy raises the limo’s partition. We see a reflection of Peter Parker holding up his phone and filming.]

[Peter gets out of the car to find a small private plane waiting for him.]

Happy: Come on. I’m not carrying your bags. Let’s go.

Peter: Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?

Happy: There’s a bathroom on it.

[Inside the plane, we see a view of the cockpit. Two seats for the pilot and the copilot are there no one is sitting in them.]

Peter: Whoa. No pilot? That’s awesome.

[Peter sits down across from Happy, directly facing him.]

Happy: Is that where you’re gonna sit?

Peter: Yeah.

Happy: This is your first time on a private plane?

Peter: My first time on any plane.

[Happy moves away to sit in another seat.]

Peter: Should it...? Should it be...? Should it be making that noise?

[Later. Peter puts a finger to his lips and makes a shushing sound.]

Peter: Shh.

[Camera reveals Happy snoring. At the sound of Peter’s chuckle, Happy jerks awake, causing the whole frame to shake.]

[Inside Berlin Brandenburg Airport, we see German signs, Happy dragging his luggage behind him, and Peter’s face in quick succession.]

[Peter is sightseeing Berlin. We see Berlin streets, the Brandenburg Gate, a street performer, foreign girls, and a pretzel vendor.]

Peter: No one has actually told me why I’m in Berlin or what I’m doing. Something about Captain America going crazy.

[Happy and Peter enter a hotel.]

Happy: (pointing at a door) This is you.

Peter: Oh, we’re neighbors?

Happy: We’re not roommates. Suit up.

[Peter's hotel room. Standing in front of a mirror, we see Peter wearing his homemade Spider-Man suit, consisting of a thin, baggy sweatshirt, goggles with shutters, and web-shooters.]

Peter: Okay, Peter, you got this. You got this.

Happy: What the hell are you wearing?

[Happy is staring at Peter with a horrified look. Peter tilts down the camera to reveal his feet.]

Peter: It’s my suit.

Happy: Where’s the case?

Peter: What case? That’s not my...

[Happy opens a door, showing Peter another area of his suite.]

Peter: What? I thought that was a closet. This is still my room?

Happy: Go. Please.

Peter: My room is way bigger than...

Happy: There.

[A case is sitting on a coffee table.]

Peter: I found the case. I found the case. I found the case.

[He plucks up a card that says “A minor upgrade -TS” from the case.]

Peter: “A minor upgrade”?

[When Peter unbuckles a lock the case unfolds itself, revealing a high tech Spider-Man suit complete with awesome holograms.]

Peter: Whoa. Oh my God.

Happy: Put it on.

Peter: What the...? This is the coolest thing I’ve ever seen-

Happy: Let’s go.

Peter: But, yeah. Well, I don’t understand. Is it for me?

[Camera spins to find Happy leaving the room.]

Peter: Happy, Happy, wait.

[Peter takes off the mask of his homemade Spider-Man suit with a huge, excited grin on his face.]

Peter: This is insane. Insane. Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes. This is the greatest day of my life.

Happy: Let’s go.

[He has come to drag a hyped-up Peter out of the room.]

Peter: Okay.

Happy: Come on.

[Outside Flughafen Leipzig-Halle, We see Iron Man, War Machine, Captain America, Black Widow, and Black Panther confronting each other.]

Peter: (whispers) Okay, there’s Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow. Whoa. Who’s that new guy?

Tony: Underoos!

[We see Peter, now dressed in the Spider-Man suit that Tony gave him.]

Peter: Oh, that’s me. I gotta go. I gotta go.

[Peter puts down the phone and proceeds to snatch Captain America’s shield with his web.]

[Later.]

Peter: Hey, everyone.

[He is holding his camera and flying through the air to find a safe spot. We see and hear explosions everywhere.]

Peter: Okay, so the craziest thing just happened, right? I just had a fight with Captain America and I stole his shield and I threw it at him-

[We hear a metallic noise. Ant-Man grows into a giant in the background and grabs War Machine by his ankle. Peter turns to see this.]

Peter: What the hell? He’s big now. I gotta go. Hang on.

[The phone is put down and for a moment, all we see are the sky and the clouds. Then we hear the battle commencing and see Peter being flung through the air.]

Peter: Whoa!

[Back in Peter's hotel room. Peter is facing the camera, now dressed in a grey NASA T-shirt. It is obvious that he is still high on adrenaline.]

Peter: It was the most amazing thing that’s ever happened! So Mr. Stark was like, “Hey, Underoos!” and I just sort of flipped in and I stole Cap’s shield. I was like, “Hey, what’s up, everybody?” And then...

[There’s a knock on his door.]

Peter: Hey, just a second! Coming!

[He backflips to the door, but before he can open it, Happy enters in a bathrobe.]

Peter: Hey.

Happy: We have thin walls here.

[Camera starts rolling. We are now inside Tony's car. A hand reaches for it and we tilt up to find Tony Stark in a suit and sunglasses ensemble.]

Tony: What are you doing, a little video diary?

Peter: (embarrassed) Yeah.

Tony: It’s all right. I’d probably do the same.

Happy: (from the driver’s seat) I told him not to do it. He was filming everything.

Tony: It’s okay.

Happy: I’m gonna wipe the chip.

Tony: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what? We should actually... We should make an alibi video for your aunt anyway. You ready?

[Tony takes off his sunglasses, revealing a badly bruised face.]

Peter: Yeah, hold on.

Tony: We rolling?

Peter: An alibi? Sure.

Tony: Get in the frame.

Peter: Okay.

Tony: Hey, May. How you doing? What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.

[Peter turns to Tony with a frown on his face. Tony chuckles and pats Peter’s shoulder, whose face now wears an uncomfortable smile.]

Tony: Peter, that’s inappropriate. All right, let’s start over. You can edit it.

Peter: Mm-hmm.

[Looking at Tony, Peter chuckles.]

Tony: Three, two, one. Hey, May. My gosh, uh, I wanted to tell you what an incredible job your nephew did this weekend at the Stark internship retreat. Everyone was impressed.

[Tony is putting on a solemn face. Peter offers the camera a wide-eyed, tight-lipped smile, trying to look innocent. Suddenly, we hear a loud honk.]

Happy: Come on! It’s a freaking merge. (to Tony) I’m sorry.

Tony: This is because you’re not on Queens Boulevard. (to the camera) See, Happy is... is hoping to get bumped up to asset management. He was forehead of security, and before that, he was just a driver.

[Still driving, Happy gives Tony a sidelong glance.]

Happy: That was a private conversation. I don’t like joking about this. It was hard for me to talk to you about that.

Tony: No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?

[Happy slams on the brakes, making the car screech to a stop.]

Happy: All right. Here we are. End of the line. Whoops.

[Tony laughs and films Peter, who looks a bit pale.]

Tony: Happy, can you give us a moment?

Happy: You want me to leave the car?

Tony: Why don’t you grab Peter’s case out of the trunk.

[Peter’s film finally stops rolling. He slowly lowers his phone, shocked.]

Peter: I can keep the suit?

Tony: Yes, we were just talking about it.

[Tony puts his sunglasses back on and clears his throat. Through the rear window, we see Happy struggling with Peter’s case.]

Tony: Do me a favor, though. Happy’s kind of your point guy on this. Don’t stress him out. Don’t do anything stupid. I’ve seen his cardiogram. All right?

Peter: (enthusiastically) Yes.

Tony: Don’t do anything I would do, and definitely don’t do anything I wouldn’t do. There’s a... There’s a little grey area in there, and that’s where you operate.

Peter: Wait, does that mean that I’m an Avenger?

Tony: No.

[Happy knocks on the window and holds the case up.]

Happy: This it?

Tony: Seventh floor.

Peter: I can take that. You don’t have to take it.

Happy: You’re gonna take it?

Peter: Yeah, I can take that.

Happy: Thank you.

[Happy drops the case by the car.]

Peter: So when’s, when’s our next... When’s our next “retreat,” you know? Like...

Tony: What, next mission?

Peter: Yeah, the mission. The missions.

Tony: We’ll call you.

Peter: Do you have my numbers?

Tony: No, I mean, we’ll call you. Like, someone will call you.

Peter: Oh.

Tony: All right?

Peter: From your team.

Tony: Okay.

[Tony reaches for the door. Peter mistakes the gesture as a hug and brings his arms around Tony.]

Tony: It’s not a hug. I’m just grabbing the door for you. We’re not there yet.

[Peter awkwardly climbs out of the car. Almost as an afterthought, Tony calls out:]

Tony: Bye.

[Tony and Happy drive off. Holding his bag and the Spider-Man suit case, Peter grins.]

Peter: They’re gonna call me.

[He heads to the apartment entrance. There is a definite spring in his step.]

TWO MONTHS LATER

[Peter is standing in a packed subway train. He takes out his phone and types out a text.]

Hey Happy just checking in. I'm out of school at 2:45 PM

Ready for my next mission!

It's Peter BTW.

Parker

[He scrolls through numerous unanswered messages to Happy.]

[The train drops Peter off at 36th Avenue Station, which is right next to Midtown High. He walks downstairs to street level where football fields stand surrounded by fences. Peter strolls down the sidelines and approaches the main building. We see students playing all kinds of sports on the field. He climbs a flight of stairs, then quickly avoids being hit by a convertible driven by Flash Thompson, a slick-haired teenager.]

Flash: What’s up, Penis Parker?

[Students chuckle at that. Peter suppresses a sigh and moves on.]

[A school news report is playing in the hallway, Betty Brant and Jason Ionello as the news anchors.]

Betty: Rise and shine, Midtown Science and Technology.

Jason: Students, don’t forget about your homecoming tickets. Do you have a date for homecoming?

Betty: Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.

Jason: Okay.

Betty: Yeah.

[On TV, we see Jason rolling his eyes awkwardly.]

Principal Morita: Good morning.

[A teenage boy flies a drone around the crowded hallway. Peter walks by. Principal Morita grabs the drone out of the air.]

Principal Morita: Damn it. You, in my office right now.

[The drone pilot follows the principal. Other students carry elaborate science projects. Peter stops at his locker and takes off his jacket. He enters the combination and opens the locker. We see Peter from inside the locker. Suddenly, a hand pops up behind him. It’s Ned Leeds holding a Palpatine Lego figure over Peter’s shoulder.]

Ned: (imitating Emperor Palpatine) Join me, and together... we’ll build my new Lego Death Star.

Peter: What?

[Peter glances around and hears a cheerleader say:]

Cheerleader: So lame.

Peter: No way! That’s awesome. How many pieces?

Ned: Three thousand eight hundred and three.

Peter: That’s insane.

Ned: I know. You want to build it tonight?

Peter: No, I can’t tonight. I’ve got the Stark-

Ned: Mm-hmm. Stark internship.

Peter: Yeah, exactly.

[Having picked up his textbooks, Peter starts to walk down the hallway with his best friend.]

Ned: Always got that internship.

Peter: Yeah, well, hopefully, soon it’ll lead to a real job with them.

Ned: That would be so sweet.

Peter: Right?

Ned: He’d be all, “Good job on those spreadsheets, Peter. Here’s a gold coin.”

[Peter gives him a look.]

Ned: I don’t know how jobs work.

Peter: That’s exactly how they work.

Ned: Oh. (chuckles) I’ll knock out the basic bones of the Death Star at my place. And, and then I’ll come by afterwards...

[His voice fades out as Peter slows to a stop. In slow motion, we see who caught his eye- a pretty dark-haired girl talking with her friends down the hall. Her name is Liz. She brushes her hair back and their eyes meet for a fleeting moment. Peter is mesmerized. He can barely keep up with his conversation with Ned.]

Ned: ...because for the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it. The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops.

Peter: That’d be great.

[The school bell rings.]

Girl: I’m gonna be late!

[We are now in physics class.]

Ms. Warren: Okay, so how do we calculate linear acceleration between points A and B?

[She points at Flash, who is confidently holding up his hand.]

Ms. Warren: Flash.

Flash: It’s the product of sine of the angle and gravity divided by the mass.

Ms. Warren: Nope.

[Another hand goes up, but Ms. Warren calls out a student who clearly is having difficulty focusing on the lecture.]

Ms. Warren: Peter. You still with us?

[Peter has been watching a video of Spider-Man on YouTube.]

Peter: Uh... Uh... Yeah, yeah.

[He closes the laptop, revealing a diagram of a simple gravity pendulum.]

Peter: Uh... Mass cancels out, so it’s just gravity times sine.

Ms. Warren: Right. See, Flash, being the fastest isn’t always the best if you are wrong.

[The class bursts out in laughter. Flash has turned in his seat and is glaring at Peter.]

Flash: (whispers) You’re dead.

[Peter turns to glance at a clock. 11:38 a.m.]

[When Peter faces the front, we see that he is now wearing safety goggles.]

Mr. Cobbwell: Today we’ll be talking about Danish physicist Niels Bohr, but trust me, there is nothing Bohr-ing about his discoveries regarding quantum theory.

[As Mr. Cobbwell continues on his introduction on Bohr, Peter opens his notes to a page titled “Web Fluid Version 3.01.” We see molecule diagrams and a list of liquids such as salicylic acid, toluene, and methanol.]

[Inside an open drawer is a beaker. Peter quickly and surreptitiously pours some orange liquid in it and stirs the concoction. It starts to increase in volume, running over the beaker walls. When Peter lifts the glass stirring rod, the compound sticks to it like spiderweb. Flustered, Peter quickly shuts the drawer and looks at the clock. It’s 12:35 p.m.]

[A homecoming banner is hung over the clock on the cafeteria wall by Liz, who is standing on a ladder. Peter and Ned are sitting next to each other and watching her.]

Peter: Did Liz get a new top?

Ned: No. We’ve seen that before, but never with that skirt.

[A girl passes by and says hello to Liz.]

Girl: Liz, hey.

Liz: Hi!

Girl: That looks so good!

Peter: We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy, though.

Michelle: Too late.

[Peter and Ned turn to see Michelle sitting at the other end of their table.]

Michelle: You guys are losers.

Ned: But then why do you sit with us?

Michelle: Because I don’t have any friends.

[A poster hangs on the auditorium wall. It is for the Academic Decathlon nationals taking place in Washington D.C. on October 13-15. The Decathlon practice is commencing. Liz is standing at a podium, reading the quiz cards. Ned, Charles, Abe, and Cindy are seated on the stage. Bells are placed in front of them.]

Liz: Let’s move to the next question. What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?

Charles: Hydrogen’s the lightest. That’s not the question. Okay. Yeah.

Abe: Uranium.

[Cindy Moon, who was frantically searching the books, glares at Abe.]

Liz: That is correct. Thank you, Abraham.

Abe: (quietly pumping his fist in the air) Yes.

Liz: Please open your books to page ten.

[A few feet away, Peter is conversing with Mr. Harrington, the teacher who is in charge of the Decathlon team.]

Mr. Harrington: Peter, it’s nationals. Is there no way you could take one weekend off?

Peter: I can’t go to Washington because if Mr. Stark needs me, then I have to make sure that I’m here.

Flash: You’ve never even been in the same room as Tony Stark.

[Flash speaks up from behind them, reading a book with his feet propped up in a chair.]

Cindy: Wait, what’s happening?

[Sally Avril, who is lying on her stomach and studying her notes, answers her.]

Sally: Peter’s not going to Washington.

Cindy: No. No, no, no, no, no. No. No.

[Abe rings the bell beside her.]

Abe: Why not?

Liz: Really? Right before nationals?

Michelle: He already quit marching band and robotics lab.

[Everyone looks at Michelle, who is leaning on the wall with a book, with a suspicious look on their faces. Michelle quickly adds:]

Michelle: I’m not obsessed with him. Just very observant.

Liz: Flash, you’re in for Peter.

Flash: Ooh, I don’t know. I gotta check my calendar first. I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up.

[Abe rings the bell.]

Abe: That is false.

Mr. Harrington: What did I tell you about using the bell for comedic purposes?

[Peter turns to see the clock: it’s still 1:18 p.m.]

[We see quick glimpses of Peter fidgeting as he looks at the clock. Fingers drumming the desk, foot tapping on the floor until finally, the clock hits 2:45 p.m. and the school bell rings.]

[The bell barely stops ringing before Peter reaches the front steps of the building. Looking around to check if anyone’s watching him, he leaps over a fence taller than himself without touching it.]

[Peter runs toward a deli and nods at a man sitting at the corner.]

Peter: Hey, what’s up?

Man: Hey, man.

[Peter enters Delmar's Deli-Grocery and heads to the counter. He seems like he’s quite a regular at the store.]

Peter: What’s up, Mr. Delmar?

Mr. Delmar: Hey, Mr. Parker. Number five, right?

[Peter picks up jelly in a plastic bag and puts it on the counter. It says "Best By 03.16.18."]

Peter: Yeah, um, and, uh, with pickles, and can you smush it down real flat? Thanks.

Deli Clerk: You got it, boss.

Mr. Delmar: How’s your aunt?

Peter: Yeah, she’s alright.

[Mr. Delmar turns to speak to his staff in Spanish.]

Mr. Delmar: La tía de é les una italiana muy bellissima. (His aunt is a very hot Italian woman.)

Deli Clerk: ¿Ah, sí? (Oh, yeah?)

Peter: ¿Cómo está tu hija, eh? (How is your daughter, huh?)

[The deli staff hoots behind the counter. Delmar’s grin fades.]

Mr. Delmar: Ten dollars.

Peter: It’s five dollars.

Mr. Delmar: For that comment, ten dollars.

Peter: Hey, come on, I’m joking. I’m joking.

[Peter pulls out some cash from his wallet and hands it over to Delmar. Delmar takes the money with a grumpy look on his face.]

Peter: Here’s five dollars.

[Peter moves toward a fat cat lying on the counter and pets him.]

Peter: What’s up, Murph? How you doing, buddy?

[When he returns to collect his food, Mr. Delmar strikes up a conversation.]

Mr. Delmar: So, how’s school?

Peter: Ah, you know, it’s boring. Got better things to do.

Mr. Delmar: Stay in school, kid. Stay in school. Otherwise, you’re gonna end up like me.

Peter: This is great.

Mr. Delmar: Best sandwiches in Queens.

[He hands Peter his sandwich.]

[Peter leaves the store and runs across the street with a bag of sandwich in his hand. He passes under an elevated train track, holding up his palm at a cab that honks at him, and runs into an alley. He takes off his shoes and throws them aside. He seems to be in a hurry.]

[From his backpack, Peter pulls out a blue and red Spider-Man suit. He knocks over a garbage can as he awkwardly takes off his pants. Peter yanks off his shirt and sweater, then steps into his suit, wearing only his boxers. Jumping, he pulls the full-body suit up over his legs. Peter fits his arms in the sleeves, then puts on the mask, which covers his entire head. The baggy suit hangs loosely over his slender frame.]

[Peter webs his backpack against a dumpster, then hits the spider emblem on his chest. The material shrinks, fitting him snugly.]

[Peter presses a button on his web-shooter, activating hologram displays, adjusts the lenses on his high tech mask, and jumps onto the roof of a building. “Blizkrieg Bop” by Ramones starts to play as he leaps across roofs with his sandwich bag in hand. Crouching down on a ledge, he looks down at the streets and sighs.]

Peter: Ah, finally.

[A bicycle chain is broken. The thief rides the stolen bike down a sidewalk, pushing passersby off the street. Peter swings after him, lands in front of him, and holds out one end of a strand of web.]

Peter: Hey, could you hold this for a second? Thanks.

[When the thief looks down at his hand, Peter uses his momentary distraction to glue him to the web. Peter lets go and the thief is pulled into the air. The thief still dangling above him, Peter holds up the bike and searches for its owner.]

Peter: Hey, is this anybody’s bike? No?

[A man comes out of a store.]

Peter: Hey, buddy, is this your bike?

Man: I have no change.

Peter: Does anyone have a pen? Do you have a pen?

[On the handle of the bike, Peter has left a note saying: “IS THIS YOUR BIKE? IF NOT, DON’T STEAL IT! SPIDER-MAN.”]

[Peter swings by a train station high above ground level and strikes a pose.]

Peter: Whoo! Everybody good?

[He then rides on top of a subway car, reading something on his phone.]

[Peter is slowly standing up on the edge of a building, the flag of the United States billowing in the wind behind him, when a man calls out:]

Street Vendor: Hey! You’re that spider guy on YouTube, right?

Peter: Call me Spider-Man!

Street Vendor: Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.

[Peter does a backflip on the roof.]

Street Vendor: Yeah!

Man: Not bad.

[One moment, Peter is swinging down from rooftops and yelling, and another moment, he is patiently giving directions to an old woman. A thin strand of web suspended between a building and an old, rusty water tank, he practices his tightrope skills, too.]

[A man tries to open a car door with a thin slab of metal. Peter sees this, jumps onto the roof of the car, then uses his web to bang the man’s head on the car. The car starts to make loud beeping noises.]

Peter: Hey, buddy. Shouldn’t steal cars. It’s bad.

[Peter glues the man’s hand to the car and jumps off.]

Car Jacker: It’s my car, dumbass!

[An old woman, Marjorie, looks out from her window and starts to shout at Peter. All hell breaks loose.]

Marjorie: Hey! Shut that off!

Peter: I was just tryin’ to-

Car Jacker: Can you tell him it’s my car?

Day Sleeper: I work at nights! Come on, dude!

Old Man: That’s not your car! That’s his car.

Peter: How was I supposed to know? He was putting that thing in the window!

Resident 1: Every day with these damn alarms!

Resident 2: Shut it off!

[The neighbors continue to shout at Peter. An old, white-haired man wearing sunglasses (Stan Lee cameo) shouts at Peter, but then Marjorie notices him from the building across the street.]

Gary: Don’t make me come down there, you punk!

Marjorie: Hey, Gary. How you doing?

Gary: Marjorie, how are you? How’s your mother?

[Later. Peter swings through an alley. His grip on his web slips, causing him to fall on his face.]

Peter: Ugh! I’m good, I’m good.

[Later. The sun is setting]

Voicemail: You have reached the voicemail box of...

Happy: Happy Hogan.

[We find Peter perching on a fire exit high above the ground and munching on his sandwich.]

Peter: Hey, Happy! Um, here’s my report for tonight. I stopped a grand theft bicycle. Couldn’t find the owner, so I just left a note. Um... I helped this lost, old Dominican lady. She was really nice and bought me a churro. So I just, um, feel like I could be doing more. You know? Just curious when the next real mission is gonna be. So, yeah, just call me back. It’s Peter. Parker.

[Peter hangs up his phone and sighs.]

Peter: Why would I tell him about the churro?

[A warning signal blinks on his web-shooter. Web fluid low. Peter ejects the cartridge, then scrambles to catch it, standing sideways off the fire escape. He places the cartridge on his belt. And spots four men entering a closed bank.]

Robber 1: Can’t wait to see this thing, guys.

Peter: Finally, something good.

[Inside Queens Community Bank, a robber wearing a Hulk mask is cutting the ATM with a high tech tool that has a glowing Chitauri energy core inside.]

Robber 1: Yo, this high tech stuff makes it too easy.

Robber 2: Told you it was worth it.

Robber 1: Okay, go, go, go.

[Another robber uses a high tech device to grab and pull off the front of the ATM. The huge chunk of metal is suspended in air. Other robbers start to bag the cash.]

Robber 3: Oh, nice.

Robber 4: We can hit, like, five more places tonight.

[Behind them, Peter silently comes through the door and awkwardly tries to strike a casual but cool-looking pose.]

Peter: (clears his throat) What’s up, guys? You forgot your PIN number?

[The robbers turn to him. Reveal that they are wearing cheap plastic masks of the Avengers. The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and Iron man.]

Peter: Whoa! You’re the Avengers. What are you guys doing here?

[One of the robbers loads his gun but Peter uses his web to grab it and hit “Iron Man” and “Thor” with it. He then proceeds to push “Hulk” away. His sticky feet hold “Thor” and throw him into a wall.]

Peter: Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys. I thought you’d be more handsome in person.

[Peter is hanging upside down from the ceiling when “Iron Man” starts to throw aimless punches at him.]

Peter: Iron Man. Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank? You’re a billionaire.

[“Hulk” comes up with a high tech weapon. Peter quickly dodges a punch from “Iron Man,” who loses balance and ends up punching “Hulk” instead. They both fall to the ground. Meanwhile, “Captain America” succeeds in picking up the high tech device that had been used to pull the metal chunk off the ATM and aims it at Peter. Peter jumps at him but is suspended in air for a short time. His voice is all distorted when he says:]

Peter: Hey! Oh, this feels so weird.

[He is thrown against the wall.]

Peter: Whoa, what is that thing?

[He is once more caught in the force field of the device and is thrown back and forth between the ceiling and the floor.]

Peter: I’m starting... to think... you’re not... the Avengers!

[With his sticky fingers, he holds onto the ground and shoots his web at a desk in the corner. He pulls on it and hits “Captain America” with his force field device.]

[Mr. Delmar is watching the attempted bank robbery from his deli across the street; money flying everywhere, Spider-Man jumping off walls, the “Avengers” trying to fight him.]

911 Operator: 911. What’s your emergency?

Mr. Delmar: Uh... Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers in a bank on 21st street.

Peter: Alright guys, let’s wrap this up. It’s a school night.

[Peter kicks “Thor” into a glass wall, making it crack. “Iron Man” holds up the force field device, but before he can do anything, Peter webs the device against the glass, jumps onto “Iron Man,” and checks his face underneath the mask.]

Peter: So, how do jerks like you get tech like this?

[“Hulk” fires up the device that cuts through metal.]

Peter: No. Wait, wait, wait!

[Peter quickly pulls “Iron Man” and himself out of the way. The plasma blast cuts through walls and hits Mr. Delmar’s store across the street. The deli-grocery bursts into flames.]

Peter: Mr. Delmar.

[Peter quickly runs into the decimated store.]

Peter: Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in there? Is anybody in here? Hello?

[He helps Mr. Delmar, who is wheezing and coughing but alive, out of the burning building. Murph the cat is safe in Peter’s arms, too. But when he turns to the bank, he finds that it is empty. The robbers have escaped.]

Peter: Oh, come on. You’ve got to be-

[The cat starts to meow. Peter hands Murph to Mr. Delmar.]

Peter: Here, here.

Mr. Delmar: Good, yeah.

[Inside the Avengers Tower, Tony’s belongings are being packed up. Dum-E picks up an expensive-looking china vase.]

Happy: (to Dum-E) Okay. Good. Yes. Yes- No. No, put that down. That’s worth more than you or me. (takes a call) Yeah?

[Peter is running down a rooftop.]

Peter: Happy, the craziest thing just happened to me. These guys were robbing an ATM with these high tech weapons-

Happy: Hey, take a breath, okay? I don’t have time for ATM robberies...

Peter: Yeah, but-

Happy: ...or the thoughtful notes you leave behind. I have moving day to worry about. Everything’s gotta be out of here by next week.

[Peter jumps onto another rooftop, then stops in his tracks.]

Peter: Wait. Wait! You’re moving? Who’s moving?

Happy: Yeah, don’t you watch the news? Tony sold Avengers Tower. We’re relocating to a new facility upstate where, hopefully, the cell service is much worse.

Peter: But what about me?

[It is Happy’s turn to be confused.]

Happy: What about you?

[Peter sits down on a streetlamp.]

Peter: Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me or something, I don’t know, something big goes down? Can I please just talk to Mr. Stark?

Happy: Look, just stay away from anything too dangerous. I’m responsible for making sure you’re responsible, okay?

[Peter leaps down into the alley he stashed his backpack in.]

Peter: I am responsible. I- Oh, crap. My backpack’s gone.

[Happy is now standing inside an elevator.]

Happy: That doesn’t sound responsible.

Peter: I’ll call you back.

Happy: Feel free not to.

[The elevator doors slide close as Happy cuts the call.]

[Peter puts his mask back on and runs out of the alley.]

[Peter climbs up his apartment building, still clad in his Spider-Man suit and dodging windows. He slides the top of his bedroom window open and looks inside. Aunt May passes in front of his open door.]

[Peter climbs into the bedroom via his ceiling and closes the window with his foot. He pulls off his mask, throws it away, and crawls across the ceiling. Trying to make no sound, he pushes the door close and hops down to the floor. We hear a quiet click as the door latch slides into place.]

[Peter makes a turn to find Ned sitting on his bed. Shocked, mouth agape. The Lego Death Star crashes to the ground and breaks down into pieces.]

May: What was that?

Peter: Uh, it’s nothing. It’s nothing!

Ned: You’re the Spider-Man. From YouTube.

Peter: I’m not. I’m not.

[Peter presses the spider emblem on his chest. The suit becomes baggy again and falls down from his body.]

Ned: You were on the ceiling.

Peter: No, I wasn’t. Ned, what are you doing in my room?

Ned: May let me in. You said we were gonna finish the Death Star.

Peter: You can’t just bust into my room!

[May opens the door, setting her hair free from a low bun. She waves a rag in front of her face to dissipate the smoke coming from the kitchen.]

May: The turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster. Let’s go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want Thai?

Ned: Yes.

Peter: No. He’s got a thing.

Ned: A thing to do after.

May: Okay.

[She waves a finger at Peter, who is clad only in his boxers.]

May: Maybe put on some clothes.

[May leaves and closes the door behind her.]

Ned: Oh, she doesn’t know?

Peter: Nobody knows. I mean, Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit, but that’s it.

Ned: (whispers) Tony Stark made you that? Are you an Avenger?

Peter: (hesitates) Yeah, basically.

Ned: Whoa...

Peter: You can’t tell anybody about this. You gotta keep it a secret.

Ned: A secret? Why?

Peter: You know what she’s like. If she finds out people try and kill me every single night, she’s not going to let me do this anymore. Come on, Ned, please.

Ned: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I’ll level with you. I don’t think I can keep this a secret. This is the greatest thing that’s ever happened to me, Peter!

Peter: Ned, May cannot know. I cannot do that to her right now, you know? I mean, everything that’s happened with her, I... Please.

Ned: Okay.

Peter: Just swear it, okay?

Ned: I swear.

Peter: Thank you.

Ned: Yeah.

[Peter walks away, running his hands through his hair.]

Peter: I can’t believe this is happening right now.

Ned: Can I try the suit on?

Peter: No.

Ned: How does it work? Is it magnets? How do you shoot the strings?

Peter: I’m gonna tell you about this at school tomorrow, okay?

Ned: Great. Okay, well, wait, then. How do you do this and the Stark internship?

Peter: This is the Stark internship.

Ned: Oh.

Peter: Just get out of here.

[Peter ushers Ned out, leans on the door, and facepalms.]

[Peter and may are sitting at a small table at Prachya Thai and eating dinner. May tries to make Peter talk, but he looks distracted.]

May: What’s the matter? Thought you loved larb. It’s too larby? Not larby enough. How many times do I have to say “larb” before you talk to me? You know I larb you.

Peter: I’m just stressed. The internship, and I’m tired. A lot of work.

May: The Stark internship. I have to tell you, not a fan of that Tony Stark. Distracted all the time... he’s got you in your head.

[A news report on the television behind May catches Peter’s attention.]

News Anchor: The beloved Queens’ institution, Delmar’s Sandwiches, was destroyed...

May: What does he have you doing?

News Anchor: ...in an explosion...

May: You need to use your instincts.

[She becomes quiet as she turns to listen to the news reporter.]

News Anchor: ...earlier tonight after an ATM robbery was thwarted by Queens’ own colorful local crime-stopper, the Spider-Man. As the Spider-Man attempted to foil their heist, a powerful blast was set off, slicing through the bodega across the street. Miraculously, no one was harmed.

[Aunt May turns back to Peter with a serious expression.]

May: If you spot something like that happening, you turn and you run the other way.

Peter: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.

May: Six blocks away from us.

Peter: I... uh... I need a new backpack.

[May puts a finger to her ear, disbelief clear on her face.]

May: What?

Peter: I need a new backpack.

May: That’s five.

[A waiter brings a new dish to their table, his eyes glued on May.]

Thai Waiter: Sticky rice pudding.

May: Oh, we didn’t order that.

Thai Waiter: It’s on the house.

[The waiter winks, then leaves.]

May: Oh! Thanks. (to Peter) That’s nice of him.

Peter: I think he larbs you.

[At Peter’s joke, May points at herself with a exaggerated look of surprise.]

[The next morning, Peter is walking down the street with Ned, carrying a huge stack of thick books in his arms due to the loss of his backpack.]

Ned: You got bit by a spider? Can it bite me? Well, it probably would’ve hurt, right? You know what? Whatever. Even if it did hurt, I’d let it bite me. Maybe. How much did it hurt?

Peter: The spider’s dead, Ned.

[Peter cuts the conversation short, allowing no room for further discussion on the subject. Ned shrugs and looks ahead. His eyes go wide.]

Ned: Whoa.

[Ned and Peter stop short, examining Delmar’s Sandwiches. It is almost burnt down, the store name almost illegible. Police tape and barricades surround the shop. Various police officers and crime scene investigators are working around it.]

Ned: You were here?

[Peter warily eyes the agents standing near the scene.]

Peter: Yeah.

Ned: You could’ve died.

[The teens stare at the badly damaged building. Expressions completely serious.]

Ned: Do you lay eggs?

Peter: What? No.

[Peter laughs at the absurd and anticlimactic suggestion.]

[In the middle of a chemistry lecture. A torch is boiling a dark-colored liquid on the desk. Peter and Ned are wearing safety glasses. Ned rolls over in his chair toward Peter, who is scribbling in his notebook.]

Ned: (in a low voice) Can you spit venom?

Peter: No.

Ned: Can you summon an army of spiders?

[Suppressing a sigh, Peter looks up in the guise of concentrating on the lecture and bends down again to take some notes.]

Peter: No, Ned.

History Teacher: The Sokovia Accords were put into place...

[Over Peter’s shoulder, we see a teacher droning on. Ned leans into frame and engages in a whispered conversation with Peter.]

Ned: How far can you shoot your webs?

Peter: It’s unknown. Shut up.

History Teacher: ...to begin regulating...

Ned: If I was you, I would stand on the edge of a building and just shoot it as far as I could-

Peter: Shut up, Ned.

[Peter’s voice rises a little in volume. The girl sitting in front of Peter and Ned turns around and shoots them an irritated glare.]

[A small, old television is set up beside Coach Wilson, the PE teacher, who is standing with a bored expression. Captain America’s Fitness Challenge is playing on the screen. Captain America, in his full uniform, smiles pleasantly, standing in a locker room.]

Steve: Hi. I’m Captain America. Whether you’re in the classroom or on the battlefield...

[Midtown High students are sitting in neat rows on the bleachers, watching Captain America give a speech on screen. We close up on Peter and Ned. Behind them, Michelle is completely engrossed in a book called ‘Of Human Bondage’.]

Ned: Do you know him too?

Peter: Yeah, we met.

[Ned’s eyes widen in awe and his jaw goes slack.]

Steve: ...fitness can be the difference between success or failure.

Peter: I stole his shield.

[Peter boasts, feigning nonchalance. Ned’s jaw drops even more.]

Ned: What?

[Peter and Ned continue to watch the television with their classmates. We can see Captain over their shoulders.]

Steve: Today, my good friend, your gym teacher...

[Captain points to his right. Coach Wilson, who is apparently standing on the wrong side, waves his hand to the students.]

Steve: ...will be conducting the Captain America Fitness Challenge.

[He raises his hand in a salute. The screen transitions to ‘Station I: Sit-ups’.]

Coach Wilson: Thank you, Captain. I’m pretty sure this guy’s a war criminal now, but whatever. I have to show these videos. It’s required by the state. Let’s do it.

[Coach Wilson blows his whistle.]

[Midtown High School students are engaged in various exercises. Climbing ropes, doing chin-ups, push-ups, et cetera. Michelle is lying on a mat by herself and wielding her book like a weight, still immersed in its contents. We travel between students doing sit-ups in pairs.]

Ned: Do Avengers have to pay taxes?

Peter: Shh!

Ned: What does Hulk smell like?

Peter: Shh!

Ned: I bet he smells nice.

Peter: You have to shut up.

Ned: Is Captain America cool, or is he like a mean, old grandpa?

Peter: Ned, just, shh, okay?

[We finally find Peter lying on a mat and doing sit-ups. Ned is holding his legs in place for him.]

Ned: Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?

Peter: What?

Ned: Yeah. You know how there’s a guy with a headset telling the other guy where to go?

[Peter’s face contorts into a weird expression. He is still doing sit-ups faster than any other student.]

Ned: Like, like if you’re stuck in a burning building, I could tell you where to go. Because there’d be screens around me, and I could, you know, swivel around, and... ‘Cause I could be your guy in the chair.

Peter: Ned, I don’t need a guy in the chair.

Coach Wilson: Looking good, Parker.

[The teacher points at Peter as he passes the mat that Peter and Ned are working out on. Peter glances at him, then frowns and takes a huffing breath, trying to look as if the exercise is really taking a toll on him.]

[On the bleachers, Liz is sitting with a group of friends.]

Betty: Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor, marry Iron Man, and kill Hulk.

Charles: Well, what about the Spider-Man?

Betty: It’s just Spider-Man.

[When the word “Spider-Man” reaches Peter and Ned’s ears, they stop and turn at the same time to see Liz and her friends.]

Liz: Did you guys see the bank security cam on YouTube? He fought off four guys.

[Peter’s eyes go wide.]

Betty: Oh my God, she’s crushing on Spider-Man.

Charles: No way.

Liz: (shrugs) Kind of?

Betty: Ugh, gross.

[Ned and Peter exchange a look, surprised at the turn of events. Then they look back at Liz and her friends, still listening in on their conversation.]

Betty: He’s probably like, thirty.

Charles: You don’t even know what he looks like. Like, what if he’s, like, seriously burned?

Liz: I wouldn’t care. I would still love him for the person he is on the inside.

Ned: (in a loud voice) Peter knows Spider-Man!

[Peter looks at Ned, shocked. Mouth comically agape. Everyone in the gym simultaneously drops their assignments and stares at Peter. Peter hurriedly gets up and walks to the bleachers. Ned scrambles to his feet to follow him.]

Peter: (stuttering) No, I don’t. No. I... I mean...

[Flash, who was climbing up a rope, slides down to the ground.]

Ned: They’re friends.

Flash: Yeah, like Coach Wilson and Captain America are friends.

Peter: (stuttering) I’ve met him. Yeah. A couple times. But it’s, um... through the Stark internship. Mm-hmm.

[Peter turns to Ned, teeth set.]

Peter: Yeah, well. I’m not really supposed to talk about it.

Flash: Well, that’s awesome. Hey, you know what? Maybe you should invite him to Liz’s party. Right?

Liz: Yeah, I’m having people over tonight. You’re more than welcome to come.

Peter: Having a party?

Flash: Yeah, it’s gonna be dope. You should totally invite your personal friend Spider-Man.

Peter: Um...

Liz: It’s okay. I know Peter’s way too busy for parties anyway, so...

[Liz comes to Peter’s rescue, saving Peter from embarrassing himself even further. Flash saunters closer and walks by Peter.]

Flash: Come on. He’ll be there. Right, Parker?

[The bell buzzes. Tilting her head toward Peter in a tiny nod of farewell, Liz walks off. Peter, frustrated, throws his hands in the air and swivels to glare at Ned. He moves closer.]

Peter: What are you doing?

Ned: (in a hushed voice) Helping you out. Did you not hear her? Liz has a crush on you.

[Peter hesitates, searching for words.]

Ned: Dude, you’re an Avenger. If any one of us has a chance with a senior girl, it’s you.

[Ned walks away. Peter stands rooted in place, considering the idea.]

[May drives Ned and Peter to Liz’s house. Exciting, upbeat music pours out from the house. May slows her car and talks to the boys.]

May: House party in the suburbs. Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.

Ned: It’ll be a night to remember.

May: (laughs) Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat.

Ned: Yeah, it gives me confidence.

May: Hmm.

[Peter is looking out the window, removed from the merry conversation taking place beside him.]

Peter: This is a mistake. (to May) Hey, let’s just go home.

May: Oh, Peter. I know. I know it’s really hard trying to fit in with all the changes your body’s going through. It’s flowering now.

[The absurd, out-of-place speech makes Peter chuckle.]

Peter: Uh-huh.

May: (to Ned) He’s so stressed out lately.

Ned: What helps with stress is going to a party. We should go to the party.

Peter: Yeah, let’s do it. Yeah. I’m gonna go. I’m gonna go.

[Peter opens the car door and steps out.]

May: Peter.

[When Aunt May calls his name, Peter stops and leans in to listen to his aunt through the window. Ned gets out behind them.]

May: Have fun, okay?

Peter: (nods) I will.

May: (in a soft voice) Okay.

Ned: Bye, May!

[Ned waves with a huge grin on his face. Peter closes the door and catches up to him. They approach the house side by side.]

Ned: Dude, you have the suit, right?

[Peter pulls up his sleeve in order to offer Ned a glimpse of his Spider-Man suit under it.]

Peter: Yeah.

Ned: This is gonna change our lives.

[The front door opens, revealing Peter and Ned. They enter the crowded house party and glance around anxiously. Peter looks especially nervous. Two girls pass by in front of them, not taking any interest in their arrival.]

Girl: Annie, over here!

Annie: Hey.

[Flash is running a DJ station. Ostentatious in headphones and a yellow shirt.]

Male Voice: DJ Flash!

Ned: Okay. We’re gonna have Spider-Man swing in, say you guys are tight, and then I get a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.

Michelle: Can’t believe you guys are at this lame party.

[Michelle carelessly throws her hair back, trying to act cool. She is in the process of spreading jam on a slice of toast.]

Ned: But you’re here too.

Michelle: Am I?

[The toast crunches as Michelle takes a bite out of it and walks away.]

Liz: Oh, my gosh.

[When Peter hears Liz’s voice, his eyes go wide. He turns his head towards the sound. Liz walks down the hallway to Peter and Ned.]

Liz: Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.

Ned: Hi, Liz.

Peter: Hi, Liz.

[Peter’s high-pitched and squeaky voice betrays his nervousness.]

Liz: I’m so happy you guys came. There’s pizza and drinks. Help yourself.

Peter: What a great party.

Liz: Thanks.

[The sound of glass breaking catches their attention.]

Liz: (sheepish) Oh, I... My parents will kill me if anything’s broken. I gotta-

Peter: Yeah.

Liz: Have fun.

Ned: Bye.

Liz: Bye.

[Liz walks away.]

Ned: Dude, what are you doing? She’s here. Spider it up.

Peter: No, no, no. I can’t... I cannot do this. Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay? Look, I’m just gonna... be myself.

Ned: (sighs) Peter, no one wants that.

Peter: Dude.

[Peter starts to walk away, a little bit hurt by the remark.]

Flash: (into a microphone) Penis Parker, what’s up?

[Flash plays a honking sound on the stereo system.]

Flash: So, where’s your pal Spider-Man? Let me guess. In Canada with your imaginary girlfriend?

[Honking noise again. Everyone around them laughs except Peter and Ned.]

Flash: That’s not Spider-Man. That’s just Ned in a red shirt.

[The crowd boos and chuckles. Peter frowns, determined.]

[A shirt drops to the floor and joins the already discarded pairs of jeans and shoes. Peter is standing on a roof. He steps over his clothes, wearing his Spider-Man suit, pulls off his T-shirt. As he mutters to himself, he tries to find a way to make his voice sound different.]

Peter: Hey, what’s up? I’m Spider-Man. Just thought I’d swing by and say hello to my buddy Peter. Oh, what’s up, Ned? Hey, where’s Peter, anyways? He must be around...

[Peter sighs, watching the party through glass walls with a discouraged look.]

Peter: God, this is stupid. What am I doing?

[Peter spots Ned looking for him. Then something catches his eyes. A bright blue explosion in the distance. He stands, staring at it with concern.]

Peter: What the hell?

[Peter runs across the roof and puts on his mask. Shooting webs through trees, he swings down the street.]

[He lands on another roof, flips off the house, then shoots a thin line of spiderweb over a vast golf course. It flies off, having nothing to attach itself to. Wide shot on Peter running across the golf course. The sprinklers are activated.]

Peter: (gasping) This sucks!

[Beside a bridge, we see a discarded car, scraps of metal ripped out from it. A blue ray shoots through the air at a great speed towards it. The car blows up in a huge explosion and makes the shooters cringe in surprise. One of them hoots and laughs as bolts of electricity burst out from the explosion.]

[Jackson Brice powers down the weapon. The fingers sticking out from the end of the gun curl in on themselves, forming a loose fist.]

Brice: Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia. Here. You try.

[Brice hands over the weapon to Aaron Davis, who takes it.]

Aaron: Man, I wanted something low-key. Why are you trying to upsell me, man?

[Behind them, Peter silently crawls down the side of the bridge.]

Brice: Okay, okay, okay. I got what you need, all right? I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.

[Hiding, Peter watches as Brice walks up to his van and looks inside. Spider-Man’s eyes narrow. The back of the van is full of machinery and weapons.]

Brice: Okay, I got, uh, black hole grenades, Chitauri railguns...

Schultz: You letting off shots in public now? Hurry up. Look, times are changing. We’re the only ones selling these high tech weapons.

Peter: (whispers) Oh, this must be where the ATM robbers got their stuff.

Aaron: I need something to stick up somebody. I’m not trying to shoot them back in time.

Brice: I got anti-grav climbers.

Aaron: Yo, climbers?

[Suddenly, a yodeling ringtone plays. The weapon dealers look around, alarmed.]

Brice: Okay, what the hell was that?

[The phone continues to ring. Peter takes his phone out to check caller ID. Ned is making a funny face on the screen. Schultz aims his gun at Aaron.]

Schultz: Did you set us up?

Aaron: Hey, hey, man.

[Peter flips off the wall and lands on the ground.]

Peter: Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me.

Schultz: All right.

[Schultz turns the gun on Peter, but Peter shoots his web, disarms Schultz, and charges. Using a high tech gauntlet from his van, Brice punches Peter with a burst of energy. Peter slams into the side of the bridge and lands on the ground.]

[Schultz jumps in and starts the car. Brice, laughing triumphantly, jumps onto the back of the van as his accomplice drives off.]

Peter: What was that?

[Peter shoots his web, attaching it to the weapon dealers’ open van door.]

[The van drags in through a neighborhood, knocking Peter into a trash can.]

Peter: What? Ah!

[He shoots a second strand of web.]

Schultz: We gotta call him.

Brice: No, no, no, no.

[Brice readies another high tech weapon. Outside, Peter is holding on with two thin lines of web, trying to maintain balance. Brice fires another burst of energy. It breaks off the van door.]

Schultz: Did you just do it again?

Brice: Shut up.

Schultz: I’m calling him.

[We see a phone buzzing on a table littered with computer chips and various tools. Mason picks it up. Glancing around, he answers it.]

Mason: Toomes’ phone.

[He cringes at the sound of combat coming from the other end. Toomes is working nearby, welding something, when Mason calls for him.]

Mason: Boss.

[Peter is still being dragged through the neighborhood, clinging to the back of the van.]

Peter: Oh, my butt! Unh!

[Brice powers more energy blasts at Peter, causing him to lose his grasp on one of the webs. Just as Brice powers up the weapon once more, the van meets a road bump. The whole car wobbles, making Brice accidentally fire a hole in the van. He drops the weapon and it rolls out of the vehicle. The weapons comes to a stop in someone's yard.]

[Schultz makes a sharp turn, making Peter slam into the side of a parked car. Peter then gets dragged through a line of garbage bins. He hits a solid brick pillar and drops to the ground along with a heap of bricks. Peter’s webs break off. Schultz checks the side mirror. Peter has recovered from the collision. He runs to get a clean shot and extends his hand. The web travels through the air and attaches itself to the remaining van door, but the door breaks off, already weakened by the rough treatment it received. Peter throws his arms up, exasperated.]

Peter: Great. Guess I’m gonna have to take a shortcut.

[Peter jogs on the sidewalk, jumps over a tall metal gate, and slides over a parked car. Two men are playing ping-pong in a garage as Peter runs across the yard.]

Peter: Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.

[The neighbors stop their game and gape after Spider-Man in disbelief. A dog runs into Peter, barking and standing on its hind legs to lick Peter’s face. Peter retrieves a ball with his web and throws it to the side for the dog.]

Peter: Hey, hey, buddy. Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.

[Peter swings through the neighborhood, hanging on tree branches and streetlights.]

Peter: Whoo! Now, this is more like it.

[He glides into another yard. Shooting his web, he accidentally holds onto a treehouse and knocks it off the tree. That makes him lose his grasp and land hard on the roof of a shed. It collapses under his weight.]

Peter: Whoa, whoa, whoa!

[After a few awkward banging noises, Peter rips through the door, runs across the yard, and slams through a wooden fence. He leaps into the air only to land on a small toy car, which rolls forward. Losing his balance, Peter gets tangled in a soccer net and stumbles through the hedge.]

Peter: Whoa.

[He waves his hand to a man having a barbecue in his own backyard.]

Peter: Smells really good!

[“Ferris Bueller’s Day Off” is playing on the television at a pool party, the sequence closely resembling Peter’s travel through the neighborhood. Suddenly, Peter flies into frame.]

Peter: Great movie!

[Peter skims over the pool, splashing water over the partygoers and making them scream in surprise. He then gets tangled in fairy lights and crash lands on another yard, right beside two little girls having a sleepover in a tent. The eyes on his mask malfunction, fluttering open and close in a creepy fashion.]

Peter: Ugh... Oh, hey, guys.

Tent Kids: Aahhh!

Peter: No! No!

[The tent flips over in the girls’ overzealous attempt to escape.]

[Ned stealthily brings his phone up to his ear, only to reach Peter’s voicemail.]

Peter: (on recording) Hey, it’s Peter. Leave a message.

[The phone plays a beeping tone.]

Ned: (whispers) Peter, where are you? The hat’s not working. This is not cool.

[The van zooms down the suburban street. Smoke is billowing out from the back of it. Peter falls from above, narrowly missing the car.]

Peter: Almost got you.

[He knocks over some garbage bins in his attempt to leap up onto a roof. Running across the roofs of neighboring houses, Peter tries his best to keep the van in sight. Slates become loose and fall off the roof under Peter’s feet.]

Peter: (panting) Thought you got away from me, didn’t you? I got you right where I want you.

[Finally catching up, Peter jumps toward the van.]

Peter: Surprise!

[Suddenly, Vulture snatches him from behind, flying in the wing suit, and soars high. Peter screams, looking down.]

Peter: What the hell?

[Peter wrestles to pull his leg free from Vulture’s grasp. Noticing the struggle, Vulture trains his glowing eyes at Peter menacingly and carries him even higher. Suddenly, the spider drawn on the back of Peter’s suit starts to beep and blink. A parachute unfolds itself from the hidden compartment. The air resistance from it makes rips Peter from Vulture’s grasp. During his descent, Peter gets wrapped up in the fabric.]

Peter: Aahhhh!

[Peter’s chaotic point of view shows him plunging toward the city.]

[Peter plunges into a lake. He struggles to free himself from the parachute as he sinks deeper and deeper.]

[Up above, the surface is calm, not betraying Peter’s desperate fight underwater. A figure dives into the water in an admirably fast speed. Iron Man emerges, carrying Peter. Holding him under his arms. Peter’s head hang slumped. The eyes on his mask blink open.]

Peter: Huh? Oh, hey.

[Peter wrings his mask. Water drips from it. He is sitting on a jungle gym. In front of him, Iron Man is floating in the air.]

Peter: And then he just, he just, like, swooped down like a monster and he picked me up and, uh, he took me up, like, a thousand feet and just dropped me. How’d you find me? Did you put a tracker in my suit or something?

Tony: I put everything in your suit. Including this heater.

Peter: Whoa!

[The suit is dried instantly. Steam rises from it, surrounding Peter.]

Peter: Whew, that’s better. Thanks.

[Peter shivers, his teeth chattering.]

Tony: What were you thinking?

Peter: The guy with the wings is obviously the source of the weapons. I gotta take him down.

Tony: Take him down now, huh? Steady, Crockett, there are people who handle this sort of thing.

Peter: The Avengers?

Tony: No, no, no. This is a little below their pay grade.

Peter: Anyway, Mr. Stark, you didn’t have to come all the way out here. I had that. I was fine.

Tony: Oh, I’m not here.

[Iron Man’s helmet opens, revealing an empty space where Tony’s face should have been.]

[We are in India. Tony is dressed in a white kurta and wearing a red scarf around his neck. Behind him, Indian women in saris and garlands are participating in a traditional wedding.]

Tony: Thank God this place has Wi-Fi or you would be toast right now. Thank Ganesh while you’re at it.

[A man brings Tony a drink. Tony makes a small toast, whispering his gratitude.]

Tony: Cheers.

[Tony continues to talk through the empty suit, his helmet still open.]

Tony: Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please.

Peter: Why?

Tony: Why? Because I said so!

[A woman walks to him. Tony demurely bends down in order to help her put a flower garland around his neck.]

Tony: Sorry, I’m talking to a teenager. (to Peter) Stay close to the ground. Build up your game helping little people, like that lady that bought you the churro. Can’t you just be a friendly...

[Tony takes a sip from his drink and puts it down with a clink.]

Tony: ...neighborhood Spider-Man?

Peter: But I’m ready for more than that now.

Tony: No, you are not.

[The empty Iron Man suit closes.]

Peter: That is not what you thought when I took on Captain America.

Tony: Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted to lay you out, he would’ve. Listen to me. If you come across these weapons again, call Happy.

[Peter hears a car engine revving.]

Peter: Are you driving?

[Tony gets in his car and shuts the door.]

Tony: You know, it’s never too early to start thinking about college. I got some pull at MIT. (at his phone) End call.

[Tony drives off in his yellow Audi.]

Peter: No, I don’t need to go to col- Mr. Stark-

Friday: Mr. Stark is no longer connected.

[The Iron Man suit flies off. Peter mutters grudgingly.]

Peter: That’s awesome.

[Peter approaches an empty yard, wearing his mask again.]

Peter: (mutters) Stay close to the ground? What is he talking about?

[He stops walking, spotting something. Peter enters the yard and finds a piece of Brice’s damaged weapon that had fallen out of the vehicle. He crouches down to tentatively flip it over with his fingertips.]

Peter: Whoa.

[Peter finds the glowing energy core. His phone rings. Peter answers a call from Ned.]

Peter: Hey, man, what’s up? I’m on my way back.

Ned: Actually, I was calling to say maybe you shouldn’t come. Listen to this.

[Ned pulls his phone off his ear and raises it into the air.]

Flash: When I say “penis,” you say “Parker.” Penis!

Crowd: Parker!

Flash: Penis!

Crowd: Parker!

[Peter can still hear Flash and his friends chanting in the background.]

Ned: Sorry, Peter. I guess we’re still losers. I’ll see you tomorrow.

Peter: I’ll see you tomorrow in school.

[Peter hangs up and carefully lifts the weapon. Metal and wires encase the glowing core. Peter looks up, determination clear on his masked face.]

[In Toomes' warehouse, Mason is working on a small device which is glowing with a purple hue similar to the core of Peter’s discovery. He blows on the end of the soldering tool and picks up a glowing cube. Mason throws the cube into a refrigerator, creating a rectangular portal. He reaches through it and grabs a drink.]

Mason: Whoa, whoa.

[The room shakes, making the cube parts fall off the refrigerator and closing the small opening. Toomes lands on the platform in his vulture suit. Stepping out of the suit, he walks down the stairs, stomping angrily.]

Toomes: Idiots. Idiots.

[He throws his helmet.]

Toomes: Idiots!

[A worker looks up at Vulture, alarmed.]

Mason: Boss. Your wife keeps texting you. Something about a brake light?

[Vulture approaches Mason.]

Toomes: What’d I tell you about looking at my phone?

Mason: Oh, sorry. You left it out. You know I’m a curious person by nature.

[Toomes takes the phone.]

Mason: I finished designing that high-altitude vacuum seal.

Toomes: Huh?

Mason: In case you want to, you know, go for the big one?

Toomes: You’re still on that? I told you, no. The answer’s no. Forget it.

[The badly damaged van pulls into the warehouse. Vulture and Mason look at it curiously. Brice appears from the back of the van, not bothering to open the nonexistent doors which got ripped out during their fight with Spider-Man.]

Brice: Whoo!

[Smiling, Brice takes off his hand-weapon and reaches Vulture.]

Brice: I mean, that was badass.

[Annoyed, Toomes walks toward Brice.]

Toomes: How many times have I told you not to fire them out in the open?

Brice: You said, move the merchandise.

Toomes: Under the radar. Under the radar! That’s how we survive. If you bring Damage Control or the Avengers down here, we’re through. You’re out there wearing that goofy thing, lightning up cars, calling yourself the Shocker. “I’m the Shocker. I shock people.” What is this, pro wrestling?

Brice: Ah, whatever, old man. Come on.

[Brice walks to a table and Vulture follows.]

Toomes: Look, look. I know you don’t give a crap about anything. But I do. I built this whole place because I got people I have to look after.

Brice: (mockingly) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

[Vulture stares at Brice, his expression cold.]

Toomes: You know what? I can’t afford your bullshit. Get out of here.

Brice: What?

Toomes: You’re done. You’re off the crew.

Brice: Yeah, all right. All right. Wonder if you can afford me out there, though, right? With everything I know.

[Brice walks off.]

Toomes: Excuse me?

Brice: Um, I’m just saying...

[Vulture looks at Brice, properly annoyed.]

Brice: ...maybe your wife would like to know where you really get your money from.

Toomes: You know what?

Brice: What?

Toomes: You’re right. (to Mason, in a low voice) That work?

Mason: I don’t know.

[Vulture looks at Brice again.]

Toomes: I can’t afford that.

[Vulture picks up and fires the high-tech weapon which Mason was working on. A blue ray zaps Brice, burning him down to ashes. Brice’s gauntlet clatters to the ground. The weapon powers down. Vulture looks on, a little confused. Schultz eyes the ashes.]

Schultz: Damn.

[Still confused, Vulture speaks to Mason.]

Toomes: I thought this was the antigravity gun.

Mason: What? No, that’s that one.

[Mason points to another weapon. Dropping the weapon on the worktable, Vulture approaches Brice’s remains. He picks up the Shocker’s gauntlet and cleans off the ashes. He then tosses the gauntlet to Schultz.]

Toomes: Here. Now you’re the Shocker. Go out there and find that weapon he lost.

Schultz: All right.

[Vulture walks off.]

[In shop class, Peter hits the weapon core casing with a hammer. The core emits purple light as it is partially freed from the metal casing.]

Peter: Oh.

[He starts to pull it apart. Ned joins him.]

Ned: Hey, thanks for bailing on me.

Peter: Yeah, well, something came up.

[Ned spots the glowing core.]

Ned: Oh, what is that?

[Peter struggles to take the machine apart.]

Peter: I don’t know. Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.

Ned: Seriously?

Peter: Yeah.

Ned: Awesome.

[Peter looks at Ned at the absurd reaction.]

Ned: I mean, not awesome. Totally uncool of that guy. So scary.

[Peter gives Ned a look and continues to work at the casing.]

Peter: Well, look, I think it’s a power source.

Ned: Yeah, but it’s connected to all these microprocessors. That’s an inductive charging plate. That’s what I use to charge my toothbrush.

[Ned points at a complex-looking charging mechanism connected to various wires.]

Peter: Whoever’s making these weapons is obviously combining alien tech with ours.

Ned: That is literally the coolest sentence anyone has ever said. I just want to thank you for letting me be part of your journey into this amazing-

[Peter is not listening to a word he’s saying. He brings up a hammer and hits the core really hard. The core pops out from its place, glowing. Peter and Ned immediately look at the teacher. The teacher is reading a book, sitting in his chair. He does not even spare a glance at the commotion they are causing.]

Mr. Hapgood: Keep your fingers clear of the blades.

[Peter and Ned turn back and look at the core which popped out.]

Peter: I gotta figure out what this thing is and who makes it.

Ned: We’ll go to the lab after class and run some tests.

[We see the core glowing on the table.]

Peter: Let’s do it.

[Peter and Ned share a complicated secret handshake.]

[Peter and Ned are walking down the hallway.]

Ned: First, I say we put the glowy thing in the mass spectrometer.

Peter: First, we gotta come up with a better name than “glowy thingy.”

Ned: You’re right.

[Schultz and Randy walk in. Peter spots them and freezes instantly.]

Peter: Crap.

[He throws himself behind a wall.]

Peter: (whispers) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.

[Ned looks around, then shuffles across the corridor to join Peter by a classroom window. Behind them, the chess club is peacefully playing a game. Peter peers around the corner.]

Schultz: High schools creep me out.

[Peter and Ned peer at them.]

Schultz: They got this funny smell, you know?

[Peter and Ned hide behind the wall again. They carry out a whispered conversation.]

Peter: Hey, that’s one of the guys that tried to kill me.

Ned: What?

Peter: Yeah.

Ned: We gotta get out of here.

Peter: No, no, no, no, no. I gotta follow them. Maybe they can lead me to the guy that dropped me in the lake.

Ned: Someone dropped you in a lake?

Peter: Yeah, it was not good.

[Schultz and Randy enter a classroom.]

Ned: (whispers) Peter-

Peter: (whispers) No. Stay there, Ned.

[Peter raises an arm to stop Ned and sneaks away.]

Ned: (whispers) Peter.

[Ned is left standing alone. Through the window, Brian "Tiny" McKeever notices him. He knocks on the window, making Ned turn around, startled.]

Tiny: What are you doing?

Ned: (in a normal voice) Nothing.

[Down the hall, Peter is trailing the two men. Ned tries to act nonchalant.]

Tiny: Oh.

Ned: Yeah. You good?

Tiny: Chess.

[Peter sneaks down a staircase into the classroom. Schultz and Randy are rummaging through the room.]

Randy: Can you imagine what the boss would say if he knew where we were?

Schultz: It’s saying there was an energy pulse right here.

[Peter slowly walks down the stairs and takes off his bag.]

Randy: There’s no sign of the weapon. And even if it was here, now it’s gone.

Schultz: So are we.

[Schultz looks in Peter’s direction. We see no one there. An upside-down chair standing on the table shakes a little. Spotting the anomaly, Schultz gets closer, putting his hand on his gun. He crosses the room and pauses by the worktable, scanning the area. As the men head out, we tilt down to reveal Peter clinging under the table. He shoots a tiny robotic spider at one of the men’s shoes. It stealthily climbs up the man’s leg.]

[Sitting in Peter's room, Ned holds the web-shooter. It projects a hologram model of the city. Peter hops onto the bed next to Ned.]

Ned: This is so awesome.

Peter: I know, right?

[Ned pokes it and the model becomes more defined.]

Peter: They’re in Brooklyn.

[Later. Ned is still studying the hologram and Peter is hanging upside down, eating chips.]

Ned: Staten Island.

[Night has fallen. Ned lies on the floor while Peter works at his desk. Ned glances at the hologram.]

Ned: Leaving Jersey.

[With a shooter, Peter projects a characterized image of his mask on the wall.]

[Later. Ned now lies on the bed. The hologram model starts to beep. Startled, he sits up, wearing the Spider-Man mask. He grabs the hologram model next to him.]

Ned: They stopped.

[Peter pops into frame, hanging from the ceiling. He turns around, a little groggy, and eyes the model.]

Peter: Maryland?

Ned: What’s there?

Peter: I don’t know. Evil lair?

Ned: They have a lair?

Peter: Dude. A gang with alien guns run by a guy with wings? Yeah, they have a lair.

Ned: (nods) Badass. But how are you gonna get there if it’s, like, 300 miles away?

[They simultaneously turn to face the Academic Decathlon poster.]

Peter: It’s not too far from D.C.

[Midtown High students are waiting by a yellow bus, dressed in their yellow uniform jackets. Peter runs toward them.]

Abe: Hey, it’s Peter.

Peter: Guys.

Liz: Peter?

Friend: Hey, buddy.

Peter: Yeah, I was hoping maybe I could rejoin the team.

[Flash, standing in the back, walks forward to face Peter.]

Flash: No, no way. You can’t just quit on us, stroll up, and be welcomed back by everyone.

[The teacher walks out of the bus.]

Mr. Harrington: Hey, welcome back, Peter. Flash, you’re back to first alternate.

Flash: What?

Abe: He’s taking your place.

[Michelle appears behind them, sans uniform.]

Michelle: Excuse me, can we go already? ‘Cause I was hoping to get in some light protesting in front of one of the embassies before dinner, so.

Mr. Harrington: Protesting is patriotic. Let’s get on the bus.

[Flash shrugs off his jacket and sullenly thrusts it into Peter’s arms.]

[The bus is travelling through the highway. 90 miles to Baltimore, 126 miles to Washington.]

Liz: Focus up, everyone. Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.

[The students are holding bells, focusing on Liz’s quiz. They ring their bells before answering.]

Cindy: The second law of thermodynamics.

Charles: Frank Sinatra.

Flash: Fort Sumter.

Abe: Flash is wrong.

Liz: Okay, guys, let’s focus. Next one.

Mr. Harrington: Liz, don’t overwork them.

Peter: Uh, strontium, barium, vibranium.

Liz: Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.

Peter: Glad to be back.

[Peter’s phone vibrates. He takes it out to see that Happy is calling him.]

Liz: What is the current standard unit of radioactive-

Peter: Can I take this real quick? I’ll only be a sec.

Liz: Yeah, fine.

[Peter answers his call, moving to the back seats. As he passes by, Michelle stares at him curiously, looking up from her book.]

Peter: Hello?

[Happy is talking on the phone in the Avengers Tower. Behind him, workers are carrying things.]

Happy: Got a blip on my screen here. You left New York?

[Decathlon practice continues in the background.]

Liz: Okay, focus up, everyone.

Peter: Tracker.

[Peter holds the phone away from his mouth and mutters.]

Peter: (in a normal voice) Uh, yeah. No, it’s just a school trip. It’s, uh, it’s nothing.

[Peter sits in the back of the bus, next row to Ned.]

Peter: Look, Happy, I gotta say, you tracking me without my permission is a complete violation of my privacy.

[Ned points at the hologram model.]

Peter: (whispers) That’s different.

[Happy looks suspicious.]

Happy: What’s different?

Peter: Nothing. Look, it’s just the Academic Decathlon. It’s no big deal.

Happy: Hey, hey. I’ll decide if it’s no big deal.

[Peter looks annoyed. He mouths, “what?”]

Happy: Sounds like it’s no big deal, but remember, I’m watching you.

[The bus approaches Washington D.C. Above the hotel entrance, we see a banner announcing the “United States Academic Decathlon.”]

[The Decathlon team arrives in the check-in area. We see the interior of the hotel which is filled with preparations for the Decathlon. The students and teacher look on in awe as they walk in. Liz is at their front, leading everyone.]

Liz: Everyone stick together.

Mr. Harrington: Yeah.

Charles: You kidding me? This place is huge.

Flash: I’ve seen bigger.

Abe: There’s a bird in here.

Peter: (to Ned) Hey, you brought your laptop, right?

Ned: Why?

[The door to Peter and Ned's hotel room closes. The do not disturb sign is hanging on its handle. Peter and Ned unpack, shaking various belongings like wires, the purple weapon core, toothpaste, and braces out of their backpacks. Peter connects a wire to the suit. Ned is using his laptop, complicated lines of codes flashing through the screen. Peter holds a flashlight with his mouth, working on his suit.]

Ned: Peter, why are we removing the tracker from your suit?

Peter: Uh, because I gotta follow these guys to their boss before they move again and I don’t really want Mr. Stark to know about it.

Ned: So you’re lying to Iron Man now?

Peter: No, I’m not lying. He just doesn’t really get what I can do yet.

[Ned warily eyes his friend. Peter removes the tracking device from the suit.]

Peter: Ah... Gotcha.

[He takes the flashlight out of his mouth.]

Peter: All right, Happy. Enjoy tracking this lamp.

[Peter sticks the device on a lamp, then gets back to the suit. Ned is still working on the laptop.]

Ned: There’s a ton of other subsystems in here...

Peter: Hmm?

Ned: (smirks) ...but they’re all disabled by the Training Wheels Protocol.

Peter: What?

[Peter hops up next to Ned and looks at the screen. The words “Training Wheels Protocol” are written in red. The codes declare that the protocol is currently active and that “Stark Industry Key Identifier” should be entered to disable it.]

Peter: “Training Wheels Protocol?”

[Ned chuckles.]

Peter: Turn it off.

Ned: I don’t think that’s a good idea. I mean, they’re probably blocked for a reason.

Peter: Come on, man. I don’t need training wheels.

[Peter steps onto his bed and jumps up and down.]

Peter: I’m sick of him treating me like a kid all the time. It’s not cool.

Ned: But you are a kid.

Peter: Yeah, a kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands.

Ned: Peter, I just don’t think this is a great idea. I mean, what if this is illegal?

[Peter jumps down to kneel beside Ned.]

Peter: Look, please. This is my chance to prove myself. I can handle it. Ned, come on.

Ned: I really don’t think this is a good idea.

Peter: (whispers) The guy in the chair.

Ned: Don’t do that.

Peter: Come on.

[Ned sighs and types reluctantly. A blue flash of light briefly pulses through the suit. Peter and Ned look at it.]

[Peter, wearing the suit without the mask, zips up his sweat shirt to hide it and puts on his hood. He peeks out the door and looks around. The corridors are quiet and empty.]

Peter: Yeah, the glowy thing, it’s evidence. Keep it safe.

[Ned picks up the glowing core.]

Peter: All right?

Ned: Okay, okay.

[Peter activates the tracker.]

Peter: They’re moving.

[Peter hurriedly walks out of the room.]

Ned: Be careful.

[As Peter tries to walk down the hall unnoticed, Liz approaches in a bathing suit.]

Peter: Hey, Liz.

Liz: (whispers) Perfect timing. We’re gonna go swimming. Come on, come on, come on.

[She waves the other students forward.]

Peter: (whispers) What?

[The teenagers sneak by, laughing quietly.]

Sally: Hey, Peter.

Cindy: Hi.

[Flash slaps Peter’s butt.]

Peter: Hey!

[Peter squeals in a high tone, offended.]

Peter: I was, uh... I was gonna go study, um, in the business center.

Liz: Peter, you don’t need to study. You’re, like, the smartest guy I’ve ever met.

[Peter looks at Liz, bewitched.]

Liz: And besides... Um, a rebellious group activity the day before competition is good for morale.

Peter: Hmm?

Liz: Um, well, I read that in a TED Talk, so, I-I heard it in a TED Talk. And I read a coaching book.

[Liz smiles and nods.]

Peter: Wow, you really... This is really important to you.

Liz: Yeah. It’s our future. I’m not gonna screw it up. Besides, we raided the minibar and these candy bars were, like, eleven dollars. So get your trunks on and come on.

[Liz throws a candy bar at Peter in a smooth arc.]

Charles: Come on.

Sally: Come on.

Liz: I’m coming, I’m coming.

[Liz catches up with the others.]

[At an indoor swimming pool, the Decathlon teammates swim. Liz sits on a wall between the pool and a spa.]

[Wearing his suit without the mask, Peter watches Liz through a window on the roof. Liz playfully chats with her teammates. Peter sighs. Stepping back from the window, he tightens the straps on his backpack. Peter puts on the mask. A brief glow expands from the spider emblem on his chest.]

Suit Lady: Good evening, Peter.

Peter: Hello? Hello?

Suit Lady: Congratulations on completing the rigorous Training Wheels Protocol and gaining access to your suit’s full capabilities.

[We see Peter’s view from inside the spider suit, quickly changing to different view modes.]

Peter: Ah, thank you.

Suit Lady: So where would you like to take me tonight?

Peter: (stuttering) S, I, I, put a tracker on someone. He’s a bad guy.

Suit Lady: Tracker located.

[We see the spider suit tracking down the path that leads to the guy Peter is after.]

Suit Lady: Plotting course to intercept target.

Peter: Okay, well, as long as I make it back in time for Decathlon, it’s fine.

[Peter swings from a web and lands on a truck. As the truck runs past, we see a banner that says “United States Academic Decathlon.”]

[Peter rides on a different truck, raging down the road. We see Peter in his spider suit crouching on top of the truck, with the dark night sky in the background.]

Suit Lady: One hundred meters from destination and closing.

[The truck roars past a patch of grass.]

Suit Lady: Jump now.

[Peter leaps off the truck and rolls down a grassy bank. He runs across the bank through the tall grass, approaching an abandoned gas station.]

Suit Lady: Detecting three individuals.

[We see Peter observing the gas station from behind his back. The station is dark, with a couple of trucks in its driveway. He stops and crouches to observe the gas station.]

Peter: (whispers) Why is their secret lair in a gas station? That’s so lame.

[Peter jumps, and climbs on top of the empty gas price sign.]

Peter: Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?

Suit Lady: Do you want to hear what they’re saying?

Peter: I can hear what they’re saying? Uh, yeah.

Suit Lady: Activating Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.

[The spider suit display closes in on the van and shows Peter the heat signals emitted from the men inside. There are three people in the van who are quietly speaking.]

Mason: I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup. The rest is all my design.

Peter: Whoa, that’s so cool.

Randy: Can’t believe they’re still cleaning up that Triskelion mess.

Schultz: I love it. They keep making messes, we keep getting rich.

Mason: Target inbound.

Peter: Whoa, they’re in the middle of a heist. I could catch them all red-handed. This is awesome. Okay, I’m gonna get a little closer so I can see what’s happening.

Suit Lady: Would you like me to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?

Peter: Uh, Enhanced Combat Mode? Yeah.

Suit Lady: Activating Instant Kill.

[The eyes of Peter’s spider suit turn into evil-looking tiny red dots.]

Peter: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don’t want to kill anybody!

Suit Lady: Deactivating Instant Kill.

[The eyes switch back to their normal width and color. Peter jumps off the sign and falls on his face on the hard asphalt ground. Peter grunts.]

Schultz: Did you hear that?

Peter: What the hell just happened? What was that?

Suit Lady: You jumped off the sign and landed on your face.

[He fires web pellets from his shooter which land on the gas station sign.]

Peter: Suit lady, what’s wrong with my web-shooters?

[Peter runs to hide behind a sign.]

Suit Lady: Rapid-fire is the default for Enhanced Combat Mode.

Peter: Why would I need rapid-fire?

Suit Lady: Would you like to see more options?

[We see Peter’s hands from his spider suit point of view. All kinds of webs are shown from which he can choose.]

Suit Lady: You have 576 possible web-shooter combinations.

Peter: Whoa, Mr. Stark really overdid it.

[Inside the car:]

Schultz: You two wait right here.

Mason: Wait. You’re gonna want to turn on the dampers, though, or that thing will shatter your arm.

Schultz: All right. Where’s the dampers?

[Peter is still looking down at all the options for his webs displayed over his hands.]

Peter: That one.

Suit Lady: Great choice.

[One of the options turn red.]

Suit Lady: Would you like me to set this as your new default?

[Peter shoots an electrified web at a neon sign, making it blink on and off.]

Peter: No, no, no.

[Through the window, we see Peter struggling with his electrified webs. He keeps shooting, and the neon sign keeps flashing. The men in the car are oblivious.]

Mason: Push that in.

Schultz: Right here?

Mason: No, no, the other-

Schultz: This one right here?

Mason: Yeah, push. [Peter runs behind the gas station, away from the truck, and leaps on some trucks to reach the roof of the building.]

Peter: What was that?

Suit Lady: Taser webs.

Peter: Taser webs? I don’t want taser webs.

Suit Lady: You seem to be very unfamiliar with your web-shooter settings. Would you like to run a refresher course?

[Peter sits on the roof to get a better look at the men.]

Peter: No, just... You choose.

Suit Lady: Sure thing.

[Inside the DODC convoy truck:]

DODC Central: Six-Alpha-Niner. Are you running on time?

DODC Driver: Copy, Central. Six-Alpha-Niner on schedule.

[Schultz, Vulture’s bald henchman, peers through binoculars. Three trucks are approaching the gas station.]

Schultz: I have visual.

Mason: Green light, green light.

[Peter spots Vulture flying overhead in his wing suit.]

Peter: Oh, that’s him.

[Vulture soars over a convoy of transport trucks. The suit’s eyes glow green in the dark.]

Vulture: Okay, I got eyes on the convoy. Pulling in behind the caboose.

Mason: Deploy anchors.

[Vulture fires cables onto the roof of the last truck. He drops a cube onto the trailer, which separates into four pieces. Arranged in a rectangle, they create a glowing portal through the roof.]

Vulture: Dropping down.

[Vulture detaches from his suit and falls through the portal, but the truck driver seems unaware of what’s happening.]

[Inside the van, Mason speaks into his walkie-talkie, surrounded by wires and screens.]

Mason: No outgoing distress signals. You’re all clear.

[We see Vulture’s green-filtered view of the inside of the trailer. Cage-like boxes contain exotic items.]

Vulture: Hey. Looks like they got some good stuff here.

[He rips off the door from a cage full of tech. Peter climbs on top of the trailer and touches the portal. His fingers go through.]

Peter: Whoa, cool. It’s some kind of matter phase shifter.

[Peter crawls down the ceiling as Vulture rises into view. Vulture kneels and zips a duffel bag.]

Vulture: Alright, coming up.

[Vulture jumps through the portal and onto the roof of the trailer. Peter shoots a web at Vulture’s bag, pulling it away.]

Peter: Hey, Big Bird! This doesn’t belong to you!

[Vulture’s green eyes glare intimidatingly in Peter’s direction.]

Peter: Oh, god.

[Vulture gets into his wing suit and soars toward Peter. Peter jumps over him and fires long, weak webs past Vulture.]

Peter: Suit lady, what was that?

Suit Lady: You told me to choose.

[Vulture attacks Peter and Peter tries to balance himself on the edge of the trailer.]

Peter: What? No, just set everything back to normal.

[Peter grabs Vulture’s duffel bag, and starts to tug.]

Suit Lady: Activating all systems.

[Peter rips the bag out of Vulture’s talons. He falls through the portal back into the truck. The portal cube is thrown off position by Peter’s movement. He immediately jumps up to get out but slams his head on the now solid roof. Peter loses consciousness. Cut to black.]

[Time seems to have passed, and Peter lies motionless on the floor of the trailer. The truck shakes to a stop, waking Peter up.]

Peter: Oh, my head.

Suit Lady: You appear to have a mild concussion.

[With a headache, Peter stands up with a hand to his head.]

Peter: Hey, so where am I right now?

[Peter looks around, but cannot figure out where he is.]

Suit Lady: I’m not sure. The container walls are hindering my sensors.

Peter: Wait a minute. They must have hijacked the truck and taken me to their evil lair. Okay, suit lady. We’re gonna have to fight our way out of this one.

[Peter prepares himself to burst through the truck’s metal doors.]

Peter: Three, two, one!

[Peter smashes through the trailer doors, and finds himself in a huge warehouse full of containers. He looks around, on guard.]

Peter: What is this place? Suit lady, where am I?

Suit Lady: You’re in the most secure facility on the Eastern Seaboard. The Damage Control Deep Storage Vault.

Peter: No. Seriously?

[Shocked, Peter puts both hands to his head. On the wall before him, “DODC-V05” is written in big black letters.]

[Time has passed. Peter is clinging to the horizontal crack of the massive doors as he tries to wedge them open.]

Suit Lady: The door will most likely remain closed until morning.

[Peter kicks at the bottom of the doors.]

Peter: (disappointed) Morning?

[Later. Peter is lying on a hammock made out of his webs.]

Peter: Hey, suit lady, I kind of feel bad calling you “suit lady,” you know? I think I should probably give you a name... like Liz. No, no, no. God, that’s... that’s weird.

[With one hand, Peter swings on a rope that is also made out of his webs, and lets go, dropping to the floor and lying down.]

Peter: What about Karen?

Suit Lady: You can call me Karen if you would like.

[Peter reads a book hanging upside down. His web is held between his feet and suspending him from the ceiling.]

Peter: Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?

[Wings expand from under his arms. Peter gasps in surprise.]

Peter: What?

[Standing in front of an empty wall, Peter is now wearing his yellow Midtown high school blazer over his suit. The suit is flashing a laser spider man emblem on the wall. Peter is examining the options for his web.]

Peter: Maybe we should run that refresher course.

Karen: Ricochet web.

Peter: Ricochet web.

[Peter shoots a ricochet web on the wall and it immediately bounces back. He ducks to dodge the ball-shaped bundle of web.]

Peter: Whoa! Cool.

[Later. The wall is covered with patches of spiderwebs now.]

Karen: Splitter web.

[Peter fires two strands of web.]

[More time has passed. The wall is even messier.]

Karen: Web grenade.

[Peter jumps, and throws a small, metal-like ball of web.]

Peter: Web grenade!

[The web grenade explodes, and the web covers the wall even more.]

[Later. Peter jump ropes with a strand of web.]

[Later. Peter is lying face up on one of the trailers.]

Peter: Should I tell Liz that I’m Spider-Man?

Karen: Who is Liz?

Peter: Who is Liz? She’s.. heh. She’s the best. She’s awesome. She, uh, she’s just a girl who goes to my school. And, uh... Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her, but it’s kind of weird, you know? “Hey, I’m... I’m Spider-Man.”

Karen: What’s weird about that?

Peter: What if she’s expecting someone like Tony Stark? I mean, imagine how disappointed she’d be when she sees me.

Karen: Well, if I were her, I wouldn’t be disappointed at all.

Peter: Thanks, Karen. It’s really nice to have somebody to talk to. Hey, how long we been here anyways?

Karen: Thirty seven minutes.

Peter: What? Thirty seven minutes?

[Peter sits up, unable to control the frustration.]

Peter: That’s insane. I cannot take this anymore. I gotta... I gotta get out of here.

[Peter flips off a container and walks into it. He sighs and takes off his blazers and his hoodie.]

Peter: There’s got to be something in here I can use.

[He opens Vulture’s duffel bag.]

Peter: Okay, let’s see.

[Peter inspects a wheel-shaped metal piece then throws it away.]

Peter: Nope.

[He pulls out a Ultron head.]

Peter: That’s awesome. [The Ultron head makes a clanging sound as it is discarded on the floor. Peter holds a purple glowing object.]

Peter: Ah, hey, it’s like the glowy thing.

Karen: That glowy thing is an explosive Chitauri energy core.

Peter: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You mean, we’ve been carrying around a bomb?

Karen: It would require radiation to transform it into an explosive state.

[Peter finds his phone and tries to call Ned but can’t get any reception.]

Peter: No, no, no, no, no.

[Peter uses webs to swing to the warehouse doors. Clinging onto the doors, he starts banging and shouting, hoping someone would hear him.]

Peter: Hey! Please! Please, somebody, let me out! Hey! Karen, you have to help me override that time lock.

[Peter hangs upside down from the ceiling next to the time lock close to the doors. He has opened the lock panel and is now putting in numbers. In his hands are a notepad and a pen.]

Peter: Okay Karen. Lower the voltage and run it.

Karen: Trial unsuccessful.

Peter: Okay, we’re just gonna have to try every sequence.

[Peter crosses out the wrong sequence on his notepad.]

[The sun is rising over the Washington D.C.]

[At the hotel, Ned waits in his room. Someone knocks on the door.]

Student: Ned, Peter, we’re gonna be late. Come on, let’s go.

Ned: Okay, hold on, hold on.

[Ned grabs the energy core.]

[Peter is still trying to override the lock. He yawns, then presses some buttons.]

Karen: Initiating trial 247.

[The massive warehouse doors groan as they open.]

Peter: It worked! It works!

[Peter swings out on his webs through the opening doors. Peter crawls on the ceiling outside, then drops on the trailer of a departing truck. He lies down as the truck passes an armed guard.]

[The students are entering the Decathlon venue.]

Moderator: Please be sure all cell phones are turned off.

[Ned hand his phone in to the security.]

Security: Thank you.

[Peter is standing on the back of a trailer truck. A ringing tone is heard in the background.]

Peter: Karen, you have to get me to Decathlon as fast as possible.

Karen: Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.

Peter: Right across the street from the Washington Monument.

[We see Peter holding his phone to his ear.]

Ned: Hey, it’s Ned. Leave a message.

Peter: Ned, call me back! The glowy thing is a bomb!

[At the Decathlon, the students are scribbling. We pan down to see the purple energy core glowing in Ned’s pocket.]

Karen: There’s a vehicle approaching on your right.

[Peter grunts, and climbs on top of the cargo.]

Moderator: We have now entered sudden death.

[The students prepare themselves, trying to be calm and placing their hands on their buzzers. Flash takes a deep breath, clearly nervous.]

[The scene cuts over to Peter as he leaps on a SUV.]

Moderator: The next correct answer wins the championship.

[Michelle hits the answer bell with a bored, impassive look.]

Moderator: Midtown Tech?

Michelle: Zero.

Moderator: That is correct. Midtown takes the championship!

[Ned hugs Michelle and she smiles. More Midtown students pile in for a group hug.]

[The Midtown High students are walking toward the Washington Monument.]

Student: We won!

Liz: You guys, I am so proud of you.

Flash: Told you we didn’t need Peter.

Ned: Flash, you didn’t answer a single question.

[Michelle is standing alone with a book.]

Mr. Harrington: Taking it all in, Michelle?

Michelle: Oh, yeah, I just... um, I don’t really want to celebrate something that was built by slaves.

Mr. Harrington: Oh, I’m sure the Washington Monument wasn’t built by-

[Mr. Harrington looks up at the monument. A park ranger wobbles his hand as a confirmation to Michelle’s words. Mr. Harrington purses his lips and walks away.]

Mr. Harrington: Okay. Enjoy your book.

Michelle: Thanks.

[Peter swings on top of a bus. Peter and Ned finally reach each other on the phone.]

Peter: Oh, Ned, you’re alive!

[Ned is at the Washington Monument, about to get a security check.]

Ned: (whispers) Peter, are you okay?

Peter: Ned, Ned, where’s the glowy thing, the glowy thing?

Ned: Don’t worry, it’s safe. It’s in my backpack.

[Ned puts his backpack down on the conveyor belt for an X-ray security scan.]

Peter: No, Ned, listen! No, no, Ned, the glowy thing is dangerous.

Ned: You missed the Decathlon. I covered for you.

Peter: Ned, listen to me!

Ned: We’re at the Washington Monument now. You gotta- [Liz takes the phone from Ned.]

Liz: Peter, is that you?

Peter: Oh, hey, Liz.

Karen: Is that Liz?

[Peter jumps from the bus, tumbles on his back, and starts running.]

Peter: Please put Ned back on the phone.

Karen: You should tell her how you feel.

[Peter tries to put a word in edgewise but Liz ignores him and talks on.]

Liz: You freak! You are so lucky we won. You know, I want to be mad, but I’m more worried. Like, what is going on with you?

[Now at the Lincoln Memorial, Peter is running towards the Washington Monument.]

Peter: Liz, I have to talk to Ned. It’s really important!

Security: Miss, all items on the belt, please.

Peter: Liz, there’s something in Ned’s backpack! It’s really dangerous. Don’t let it go through an X-ray.

[Not hanging up, Liz puts Ned’s phone through the X-ray machine along with Ned’s backpack. Ned walks through the scanner, oblivious, and moves to collect his backpack. The X-ray scanner screen buzzes.]

Peter: Liz? Liz! Damn it.

[Peter keeps running, and the Washington Monument comes into view as he gets closer.]

[Ned puts on his bag. The students enter an elevator.]

Flash: Hey, Mr. Harrington, can I be the one to tell Peter he’s expelled?

[Outside the Washington Monument, Peter webs his backpack to a tree.]

[The elevator is steadily climbing upwards. The core in Ned’s backpack begins to glow.]

Tour Guide: The Washington Monument is 555 feet, 5 and 1/8 inches tall. Notice how the marble and granite are cut around the stone.

[The energy core erupts with light, breaking glass, and the tip of the monument cracks.]

[Peter arrives at the base of the monument.]

Tourist: Did you hear that?

Peter: No, no, no, no, no, no. Karen, what’s going on up there?

Karen: The Chitauri core has detonated and caused severe structural damage to the elevator.

[The spider suit provides Peter a view inside the monument, and it is shown that several people are gathered inside the elevator.]

Peter: Oh, no.

Michelle: My friends are up there!

Peter: What? Uh... Don’t worry, ma’am. Everything’s gonna be okay. Excuse me, excuse me. Oh, my god, that’s tall.

[Peter runs through the crowd, leaps onto the side of the monument, and crawls up.]

[On the elevator, Ned drops his backpack. The small space is filled with smoke.]

Charles: Oh, my god. Look at the ceiling.

[A glowing, red crack cuts across the elevator ceiling.]

Liz: Just stay calm, everyone.

Abe: Oh, we are all going to die here.

[Michelle peers up at Peter. He’s climbing on the monument, and has gotten so high that he’s merely a dot seen from below.]

Karen: Estimating 10 minutes before catastrophic failure.

[Inside the elevator:]

Charles: We're freakin' screwed.

Tour Guide: Okay guys, I know that was scary, but our safety systems are working.

[Peter is now panting.]

Karen: The safety systems are completely failing.

[The tour guide drones on in order to calm the students.]

Tour Guide: We're very safe in here.

[Outside the Monument:]

Karen: The occupants are in imminent mortal danger.

Peter: I'm going as fast as I can!

[Peter pulls himself up with double strands of web.]

[Park rangers open the doors to the elevator shaft. The tour guide opens a hatch in the ceiling of the car, and looks out.]

[Peter continues climbing.]

[Cindy is pulled out of the elevator.]

Park Ranger: Let's go. Give me your hand.

Karen: You now have 125 seconds until catastrophic failure.

[Peter’s hands slip a little.]

Peter: What? Why?

Karen: Unexpected motion has caused the deterioration to escalate.

[The spider suit shows the elevator. The park rangers rescuing the students are making the elevator move.

PETER Peter: How do I get in there?

KAREN Karen: Activating reconnaissance drone.

The emblem on Peter’s suit detaches, and the spider-shaped robot flies up, over the monument.]

Peter: Whoa, has that been there the whole time? That’s awesome.

Karen: Locating optimal entry point.

[The small drone finds a window.]

Karen: Proceed to southwest window.

Peter: Karen, I'm on my way.

[Peter moves around the monument, and continues climbing. Down below, people have started to gather to see what’s happening.]

[Inside, Abe peers down the long elevator shaft.]

[Peter reaches the top of the monument. Pausing, he turns onto his back and clings to the cracked stone.]

Peter: Ah!

[Cautiously, Peter peers over the edge to the ground far below.]

Peter: Okay. Oh, my god. Okay.

[He then takes panicky breaths and sticks to the wall.]

Karen: What's wrong? You've reached the southwest window. Why are you hesitating?

Peter: It’s fine. It’s just, I've just never been this high before.

[Peter tries to shoo away the seagulls perched on the windowsill. Karen’s voice is calm and kind as she informs Peter.]

Karen: You have also not reinstalled your parachute, so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal.

[Peter moves on top of the windowsill and the seagulls fly away.]

Peter: Perfect. Oh, my god.

[Peter kicks the window.]

Peter: Why is it not breaking?

Karen: It's a four-inch ballistic glass. You'll have to create more momentum.

[Peter shoots a web against the monument wall and rappels down the strand until his feet lie flat against the glass. Jumping, he swings against the window. The glass cracks slightly.]

[Police helicopters approach, guns ready. Speakers boom as a police officer speaks out.]

Police: This is D.C. Metro police. Identify yourself.

Peter: My friends are in there! My friends are in there! Stop!

Police: Return to the ground immediately.

[Inside the elevator:]

Mr. Harrington: Okay, who's next?

[Liz grabs Mr. Harrington’s shoulder, preparing to climb up.]

Flash: Me, it's my turn!

[Flash shoves Liz to get out first, and doesn’t give up the trophy.]

Ned: Flash, seriously? What are you doing?

Flash: Come on.

Cindy: Don't worry about the trophy.

[Flash climbs through the hatch in the ceiling of the elevator, and the car shakes.]

Students: Ah!

[Through the yet unbroken window, Peter is watching the students panic.]

[Peter stands against the window as police helicopters hover around him. An officer is aiming his gun in Peter’s direction.]

Police: Stand down! Return to the ground immediately!

[Peter is panting heavily, but he climbs to the top of the monument.]

Police: Return to the ground or we will open fire!

[The police officer follows Peter with the aim of his gun, but Peter disappears from his view to the other side of the monument.]

Police: (to the pilot) Go up, go up!

Peter: I got this.

Flash: Take my trophy!

[The car shakes again under Flash’s feet.]

Police: This is your last chance!

Peter: Oh, I'm gonna die.

[Peter jumps toward the closest helicopter and extends his web-wings, gliding over the menacing helicopter blades. He shoots a web at the skid, and swings toward the window.]

Peter: Break!

[The window shatters into pieces as Peter swings in, and the roof of the elevator is ripped off. The elevator starts to fall. Peter slides in toward the elevator shaft.]

Liz/Ned: Ahh!

[Peter shoots a strand of web onto the falling elevator, then braces his feet against the doors to the shaft. Liz, Ned and Mr. Harrington are jostled in the elevator as it is stopped.]

Peter: I did it! Whoa!

[The doors break loose, and Peter falls after the plummeting elevator. It catches on a beam and Peter falls in through the ceiling on his back. The impact breaks off a wheel and the car starts to drop again. Peter shoots a web through the hole in the ceiling, stopping the elevator’s descent. Hanging upside down with his feet braced against the ceiling of the elevator, Peter grabs on to the strand of web, and tries to make his voice sound different as he helps his friends calm down.]

Peter: Ahem. Hey, how you doing? Don't worry about it. I got you.

Ned: Yes! Yes!

[Ned swings his fist in joy and relief, making the whole elevator wobble.]

Peter: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, big guy, quit moving around.

Ned: Sorry, sir. So sorry.

[Outside, a fire truck and an ambulance arrive.]

Park Ranger: Let's go, let's go!

[With his web attached to the ceiling high above, Peter slowly pulls the elevator up the shaft. They reach an upper floor.]

Park Ranger: Okay, okay.

Cindy: Mr. Harrington, go. Ned, come on.

Peter: Alright. This is your stop.

Ned: Come on, Liz.

[The metal elevator ceiling starts to bend under Peter’s feet.]

Peter: Go, go, go. Everybody out! Move it, people. Move it, move it!

Liz: Are you sure it’s safe?

[Liz reaches out, but before she can hold Mr. Harrington’s outstretched hand, the ceiling snaps.]

Mr. Harrington: Liz!

[Peter webs Liz as the elevator falls. She dangles by her wrist.]

Peter: You’re okay. You’re okay.

[Peter pulls her up by the web, then takes her hand.]

Peter: Okay.

[His web starts to snap as he helps Liz to safety.]

Students: Oh, my god. Good, good.

Mr. Harrington: Come on up. Come on, you guys, stay back. Come on in. Come on in.

Peter: So, uh, is everyone okay?

[Liz nods.]

Karen: This is your chance, Peter. Kiss her.

[Liz and Peter hold a look. The web snaps, and Peter drops. The students, the teacher, and the park rangers look down the elevator shaft going after Peter as he falls.]

Mr. Harrington: Thank you.

[Flash peers down the shaft.]

Flash: Are you really friends with Peter Parker?

[In Vulture’s warehouse, Schultz tries out the shocker gauntlet. He can move a whole van with the force of his punch. Mason sits at his work table, clutching his work when the table wobbles.]

Mason: I can finish the next order, but without any new materials from that truck...

Toomes: Ugh, damn it. We still have enough to do the Gargan deal though, right?

Mason: Yeah, but then that's it.

[Perching on the table, Vulture strokes his chin.]

Mason: Oh, maybe it is time that I built the high-altitude seal.

Toomes: Would you shut up about that?

Mason: It's only one job.

Toomes: No.

[Schultz stands nearby.]

Toomes: Eight years, not a word from the Feds, nothing from those Halloween-costume-wearing bozos up there in Stark tower. And then all of a sudden, this little bastard in red tights shows up and he thinks he can tear down everything I've built. Really?

[Vulture shrugs.]

Toomes: I’m gonna kill him. I'm gonna find him...

Schultz: I found him.

[On TV, the news shows spider man at the Washington Monument. The headline says “Man Spider Climbs Washington Monument.”]

News Anchor: Spider-Man swooped in, heroically saving an Academic Decathlon team from Queens. The identity of the masked hero is still unknown.

[Vulture’s expression is unreadable as he studies the screen.]

[At night, the students’ families meet them by the school bus. Liz’s mother hugs Liz.]

Liz: Mom.

Doris: It’s okay. Alright.

May: Peter?

[Aunt May runs to Peter and embraces him.]

Families: Come here, come here. Oh, my god.

[At school, the student news plays on a TV in the hall.]

Jason: This past weekend, Midtown's Academic Decathlon team defeated the country's best to win the national championship. Later that day, they also defeated death.

Abe: (yells) Explosion. Sally scream. Flash scream. Everybody screamin’.

Charles: (excited) There were purple lasers and smoke everywhere, It was...

[A cat emoji appears over Charles’ mouth and a beep is inserted as he swears.]

Charles: ...just like a bon Jovi concert.

Mr. Harrington: As you know, we made it out alive, and that's the important thing. I couldn't bear to lose a student on a school trip. Not again.

[The camera amateurishly zooms in on Mr. Harrington’s face.]

Jason: Thankfully, no one was seriously injured, thanks to the Spider-Man.

Jason/Betty: (awkwardly) Thank you, Spider-Man.

Jason: Up next: The Spider-Man mania is sweeping the school. How can you show your spider spirit?

[Peter grins as he walks past the TV showing the student news. A few students are standing around the TV to watch the news. As Peter cheerfully enters another hall, Ned joins him.]

Ned: Dude, dude, dude, dude. What is it like being famous when nobody knows it's you?

Peter: Crazy, dude.

Ned: It’s crazy. Should we tell everyone?

Peter: No.

Ned: Should I tell everyone?

Peter: No, dude, no, that’s not a good idea.

Ned: Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.

Peter: I’m not going to class.

Ned: You’re already in so much trouble for ditching the Decathlon.

Peter: Dude, listen, I figured it out, right? The wing suit guy is stealing from Damage Control. And what he takes from Damage Control, that’s how he builds the weapons. So all I gotta do is catch him.

Ned: But we have a Spanish quiz.

Peter: Ned, I'm probably never gonna come back here. Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate, so when I bring this guy in-

Ned: Dude, you want to be a high school dropout?

Peter: I am so far beyond high school right now.

Principal Morita: Parker, my office.

[At detention. A video plays, featuring Captain America. He pulls up a chair and sits.]

Steve: So... You got detention. You screwed up.

[Peter sighs and bites his lip in frustration.]

Steve: You know what you did was wrong. The question is, how are you gonna make things right? Maybe you were trying to be cool. But take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years, the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules.

[We see the classroom is sparsely filled with students. Michelle is sitting in a seat behind Peter. Peter sighs again and stands up forcefully.]

Steve: We all know what's right. We all know what's wrong. Next time those turkeys try to convince you of something you know is wrong...

[Peter gets up and marches out past Michelle. Coach Wilson is slouching at a desk.]

Coach Wilson: (indifferently) Hey, where you going? Get back here.

Steve: Just think to yourself, what would Captain America do?

Coach Wilson: (to Michelle) Why are you here? You don't even have detention.

Michelle: Oh, I know. I just like coming here to sketch people in crisis.

[Michelle holds up a sketch depicting Coach Wilson.]

Michelle: Heh. It's you.

Steve: So your body's changing. Believe me, I know how that feels.

[In the empty hallway, Peter lifts a row of lockers off the ground, revealing a hidden space beneath. He grabs a bottle of web fluid and lowers the lockers. Peter throws the bottle up in the air, and catches it again.]

[Arriving home, Peter peeks in the front door.]

Peter: May?

[He checks the living room, which looks empty.]

[We are now inside Peter's bedroom. Peter is wearing normal clothes over his suit and lounging in his chair.]

Peter: Hey, Karen. What's up?

Karen: Hey, Peter. How was your Spanish quiz?

Peter: Listen, I was wondering if you could help me. I'm trying to figure out who the guys under the bridge were that night, but I mean, I can only kind of remember part of a license plate.

Karen: I can run facial recognition on the footage of that encounter.

[A string of data appears in front of Peter’s eyes.]

Peter: Footage?

Karen: Yes, Peter. I record everything you see.

Peter: Everything?

Karen: Everything.

Peter: Like all the time?

Karen: It's called the Baby Monitor Protocol.

[Peter throws away his pen in irritation.]

Peter: Yeah, of course it is. Um, yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.

Karen: With pleasure.

[Karen shows a footage of Peter fooling around in front of a mirror in his spider suit mask.]

Peter: (on video)Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party. Hey, what's up, Liz? Peter's told me a lot about you.

[The Peter in the footage winks.]

Peter: No, no, no. No, no, no. This is just me messing around. Go later in the day, later in the day.

[Karen fast-forwards the video.]

Peter: (on video) It is I, Thor, son of Odin!

[Peter is doing impressions of Thor, holding a wooden hammer in his hand.]

Peter: No, no, no, no, no, no. That's definitely... no. That's definitely not what we wanted to watch. Just...

Karen: Your impressions are very funny.

Peter: Fast-forward to the arms deal.

[Peter stands up. The footage shows three men from the arms deal that Peter was searching for.]

Peter: Okay. The two on the right, who are they?

Karen: Searching law enforcement databases. No records found for two of the individuals.

Peter: Nothing?

Karen: One individual identified. Aaron Davis, age 33. He has a criminal record and an address here in Queens.

[The spider suit displays the criminal record of Aaron Davis.]

Peter: Let's pay him a visit.

Karen: Would you like me to activate the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?

Peter: Uh, yeah.

[In a parking building, the scruffy man from the weapons deal, Aaron Davis, carries groceries to his car. The spider drone follows him. As Aaron opens the trunk, Peter arrives in his spider man suit. He sticks Aaron’s hand to the trunk with a web. Annoyed, Aaron stares at the spider drone.]

Peter: Remember me?

[Peter speaks in a deep metallic voice. He approaches Aaron’s car, and Aaron seems taken aback.]

Aaron: Uh, hey...

Peter: I need information. You're gonna give it to me now.

Aaron: All right, chill.

Peter: Come on!

Aaron: What happened to your voice?

Peter: What do you mean, what happened to my voice?

Aaron: I heard you by the bridge. I know what a girl sound like.

Peter: I'm not a girl! I'm a boy. I mean, I'm a... I'm a man.

Aaron: I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl...

Peter: I'm not a girl! I'm a man. Come on, man. Look, who is selling these weapons? I need to know. Give me names or else.

[Aaron slams the trunk shut, and Peter startles. He steps back and looks around in surprise. The spider drone chirps and flies around Peter’s head.]

Aaron: You ain't ever done this before, huh?

Peter: Deactivate interrogation mode.

[The spider drone goes back in the emblem on the suit’s chest. Aaron laughs. Peter’s voice changes back to its high-pitched tone.]

Peter: Look, man, these guys are selling weapons that are crazy dangerous. They can't just be out on the streets. Look, if one of them can just cut Delmar's bodega in half...

[Aaron is looking at his fingers, sniffing, not amused. However, when Peter mentions Delmar’s, he gains interest.]

Aaron: You know Delmar's?

Peter: Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.

Aaron: Sub Haven's pretty good.

Peter: It's too much bread.

Aaron: I like bread.

Peter: Come on, man, please.

[Peter starts to walk away.]

Peter: Stupid interrogation mode. Karen, don't ever do that again.

Aaron: The other night, you told that dude, "if you shoot somebody, shoot me." It's pretty ballsy. I don't want those weapons in this neighborhood. I got a nephew who live here.

[Peter stops when Aaron starts speaking, and walks back to him.]

Peter: Who are these guys? What can you tell me about the guy with the wings?

Aaron: Other than he's a psychopath dressed like a demon, nothing. I don't know who he is or where he is.

[Peter leans his head on Aaron’s car, and gives out a sigh.]

Aaron: I do know where he's gonna be.

Peter: Really?

Aaron: Yeah, this crazy dude I used to work with, he's supposed to be doing a deal with him.

Peter: Yes! Yes. Thank-

[Peter starts to walk happily away, giggling.]

Aaron: Hey. Hey. Hey. I didn't tell you where. You don't have a location.

Peter: Right, of course. Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just...

[Embarrassed, Peter comes closer and leans on the car.]

Peter: Yeah. Where is it?

Aaron: Can I give you some advice?

Peter: Hmm?

Aaron: You got to get better at this part of the job.

Peter: I don't understand. I'm intimidating.

[Peter demonstrates his “intimidating” pose, crossing his arms.]

Aaron: Staten Island ferry, eleven.

Peter: Oh, that's soon. Hey, that's gonna dissolve in two hours.

Aaron: No, no, no, no. Come fix this.

Peter: Two hours. You deserve that.

[Peter walks away, stabbing a finger in Aaron’s direction.]

Aaron: I got ice cream in here.

Peter: You deserve that. You're a criminal. Bye, Mr. Criminal.

[At the Staten Island Ferry terminal, Peter swings onto a building roof. As the massive orange ferry pulls out of the dock, he takes a running leap and spreads his glider wings. He lands and hangs on the hull.]

Peter: (grunts) Nice.

[He peeks through a window and sees passengers sitting inside.]

Peter: Okay, Karen, activate Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.

Karen: Sure thing.

Toomes: He’s up front. Main deck.

Schultz: I hate this guy.

Peter: It’s the guy from the bridge, right? Who’s that other guy?

Toomes: Just keep me posted.

Karen: There’s no record of him in my criminal database. Incoming call from May Peter. Should I reroute to your heads-up display?

Peter: I can’t talk right now. I’ll call her back.

[He watches Toomes. The spider drone climbs onto his head.]

Peter: Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy. We can’t let anybody get away this time.

[The drone hovers by the window. Peter climbs up to the ferry roof. He crawls to the edge and peers down at four men on the front deck.]

Peter: Who’s the guy on the left?

Karen: Mac Gargan. Extensive criminal record, including homicide. Would you like me to activate Instant Kill?

Peter: No, Karen, stop it with the Instant Kill already.

[Schultz approaches Gargan.]

Schultz: White pickup truck.

[Gargan nods to a slim man who walks away.]

Peter: Dronie, scan the ship for a white pickup truck.

[The tiny drone scans the cargo under the deck and spots a pickup truck. It hovers over the truck and scans its contents. Toomes’ coworker gets out of the car and leads the slim man to the back.]

Peter: Oh, this is too perfect. I got the weapons, buyers, and sellers all in one place.

Karen: Incoming call from Tony Stark.

Peter: No, no, no. No, no, don’t answer.

Tony: Mr. Parker. Got a sec?

Peter: Uh, I’m actually at school.

Karen: No, you’re not.

Tony: Nice work in D.C.

Peter: Okay.

Tony: My dad never really gave me a lot of support... And I’m just trying to break the cycle of shame.

Peter: Uh, I’m kind of in the middle of something right now.

Tony: Don’t cut me off when I’m complimenting you. Anyway, great things are about to-

[The ferry horn blares.]

Tony: What is that?

Peter: Uh, I’m at band practice.

Tony: That’s odd. Happy told me you quit band six weeks ago. What’s up?

Peter: I gotta go. Uh, end call.

Tony: Hey.

Peter: I’ll take those! (snatches a key chain) Yoink!

[He then leaps onto the deck.]

Peter: Hey, guys. The illegal-weapons-deal-ferry was at 10:30. You missed it.

[He disarms two guys with the spiderweb, kicks Gargan, and slams him. Peter ducks from Schultz’s Shocker gauntlet, which gets caught in a gate.]

Randy: Spider guy’s here.

[Toomes leaves his seat. Two thugs get up behind Peter.]

Peter: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast.

[Peter throws them both.]

Peter: Are you guys okay? My bad. That was a little hard.

[He eyes Schultz, who is still struggling to free himself.]

Peter: I gotta say the other guy was way better with that thing.

[He then reloads his web-shooter.]

Peter: I’m honestly, I’m, I’m shocked.

[Peter shoots a web grenade behind him, attaching a thug to the wall with it. In the cargo hold, Toomes bashes the slim man’s head against the truck. He then faces Peter, who is standing yards away on deck. Suddenly, agents come out of nowhere and aim at Peter.]

FBI Agent 1: Freeze! FBI!

FBI Agent 2: Don’t move.

FBI Agent 1: Get on the ground.

FBI Agent 1: FBI.

Peter: Wait, what do you mean, FBI?

Karen: The FBI is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Peter: I know what the FBI means, but what are they doing here?

[A mechanical wing bursts out of the truck, making the agents turn to it. Toomes flies toward the deck in his vulture suit. Agents shoot at him.]

Peter: Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

[Vulture fires a high tech weapon, drags a car, and throws it to the agents.]

Peter: Look out, look out, look out. Move, move, move!

[Vulture hits Peter, causing him to fall into the water. He then fires energy blasts at a man’s arm.]

Toomes: Get to the top deck. We’re getting out of here.

[Peter shoots his web at Schultz, but misses. He shoots the web at Vulture’s leg and pulls. Vulture hides behind his large metal wings that protects him from the gunfire, then shoots at the agents. One blast hits an indoor seating area. Peter weighs Vulture with a car attached to his web. Dodging a blast, he leaps to the upper deck and shoots some more web. Hanging from Vulture’s suit, Peter swings over the water. The flying man fires at Peter. He swings back onto the deck. Vulture cuts the strands of web with the blades of his wings. Peter shoots web at the barrel of Vulture’s high tech weapon.]

Peter: Activate Taser Web!

[Electricity travels up the strand of web and the weapon is yanked away from Vulture. On the deck, it bounces around wildly. Peter traps the weapon using lots of spiderweb.]

Toomes: You’re messing with things you don’t understand.

[The weapon’s laser beam breaks up into multiple rays. The energy blast cuts through the upper seating area, narrowly missing frightened passengers. In the air, Vulture dodges the blasts as they shoot into the sky. Schultz sprints toward an upper deck, leaps into the air, and lands on Vulture’s back. The rays slice through the length of the ferry, then vanish. In the seating area, passengers move cautiously. In the cargo bay, jets of water start to split up the ferry.]

Peter: Oh, my god. What do I do? Karen, uh, give me an X-ray of the boat and target all the strongest points.

[Peter’s display highlights spots on the structure.]

Peter: Web grenade. Web grenade.

[Shooting web, he leaps between the two sides of the ship.]

Peter: Splitter web, go.

[Peter tumbles back and forth on the upper part of the ferry, connecting the ship with strands of web. He dodges flames as he travels down the length of the ferry. Peter fires several strands of web and once, and binds them together with another strand. Reaching the bow, he crouches on the edge of the roof. He eyes the two leaning halves of the ferry that are crisscrossed with spiderweb.]

Karen: Great job, Peter. You are 98 percent successful.

Peter: Ninety-eight?

Man: Yeah, Spider-Man!

[The web strands begin to snap.]

Peter: No, no, no, no!

[Water floods the cargo hold, pushing the cars forward. People cling to posts as the stream rushes past them. On the upper level, passengers slide down the floor of the leaning ferry. The gap widens as the web strands continue to snap. Peter leaps into the air.]

Peter: No!

[He grabs a thread and shoots another. Arms outstretched, Peter hangs between the two sides, trying to hold them together.]

[Suddenly, the two sides start to move toward each other.]

Peter: What the hell?

[Peter lands gently in the seating area and looks around.]

Peter: What the hell...

[Iron Man rises into view.]

Tony: Hi, Spider-Man. Band practice, was it?

[Hovering outside, he holds up one half of the boat. Drones arrive and attach themselves to the other half. Thrusters propel the two halves of the ferry forward and join them together.]

[Iron Man looks at Peter through the window, then flies off.]

Man: Yeah, Iron Man!

[Peter swings into the cargo hold, where Iron Man is welding the ferry back together.]

Peter: Uh, Mr. Stark? Hey, Mr. Stark. Could I do anything? What do you want me to do?

Tony: I think you’ve done enough.

[Iron Man flies away. Peter climbs to the top platform of a mast and looks around. Smoke is pouring out from the massive vessel. Rescue boats and helicopters approach from all directions.]

[Schultz is walking toward Vulture in the warehouse when he speaks out:]

Toomes: So that’s it, you’re just gonna run?

Schultz: Feds were waiting for us. Now we’re on Iron Man’s radar? Yeah, I’m running. You should, too.

Toomes: You know I can’t do that.

Schultz: So now what?

Toomes: Mason, can you get that high-altitude seal thing up and running in time?

Mason: Seriously? Yes. You will not regret this.

Toomes: (to Schultz) You in?

[Schultz smiles faintly and lifts his eyebrows.]

[Helicopters are still flying around the ferry. Peter is perching on the edge of a building, sans mask, when Iron Man flies over to him.]

Tony: Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch: I tell you to stay away from this. Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit so you could sneak around behind my back doing the one thing I told you not to do.

Peter: Is everyone okay?

Tony: No thanks to you.

Peter: No thanks to me?

[Angered, Peter jumps off the edge and approaches Tony.]

Peter: Those weapons were out there, and I tried to tell you about it. But you didn’t listen. None of this would’ve happened if you had just listened to me. If you even cared, you’d actually be here.

[The Iron Man suit opens, revealing Tony inside. He steps down from the suit and marches toward Peter, who backs off.]

Tony: I did listen, kid. Who do you think called the FBI, huh? Do you know that I was the only one who believed in you? Everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a 14-year-old kid.

Peter: I’m fifteen.

Tony: No, this is where you zip it, all right? The adult is talking. What if somebody had died tonight? Different story, right? ‘Cause that’s on you. And if you died, I feel like that’s on me. I don’t need that on my conscience.

Peter: Yes, sir.

Tony: Yes.

Peter: I, I’m sorry.

Tony: Sorry doesn’t cut it.

Peter: I understand. I just wanted to be like you.

Tony: And I wanted you to be better. Okay, it’s not working out. I’m gonna need the suit back.

Peter: For how long?

Tony: Forever.

[Peter shakes his head with a shocked expression.]

Tony: Yeah. Yeah, that’s how it works.

Peter: No, no, no... Please, please, please...

Tony: Let’s have it.

Peter: You don’t understand. Please. This is all I have. I’m nothing without this suit.

Tony: If you’re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn’t have it. Okay? God, I sound like my dad.

Peter: I don’t have any other clothes.

Tony: Okay, we’ll sort that out.

[Peter walks down the hallway of his apartment wearing pink Hello Kitty pajamas and an oversized NYC tourist T-shirt. He knocks on a door, which May answers.]

Peter: (whispers) Hey.

[May inhales deeply and storms inside.]

May: I’ve been calling you all day. You didn’t answer your phone. You can’t do that. Then this ferry thing happens. I’ve called five police stations.

[Peter walks to May and stands behind her.]

May: Five. I called five of your friends.

Peter: I’m fine.

May: I called Ned’s mother.

Peter: May, I’m okay. Honestly. Just relax. I’m fine.

[May stands and faces Peter.]

May: You. Cut the bullshit. I know you left detention. I know you left the hotel room in Washington. I know you sneak out of this house every night. That’s not fine. Peter, you have to tell me what’s going on. Just lay it out. It’s just me and you.

[A beat, then Peter’s eyes fill up with tears.]

Peter: I lost the Stark internship.

May: What?

Peter: Yeah.

May: What happened?

Peter: I just thought that I could work really hard and he could, he would, you know. But I screwed it up.

[Peter sits down on the sofa next to him. May hugs him and strokes him.]

May: Oh... It’s okay, it’s okay. It’s okay.

Peter: I’m sorry I made you worry.

May: You know I’m not trying to ruin your life.

Peter: Yeah, I know.

May: Just... I used to sneak out too.

Peter: Yeah.

[May scowls, then leans in to sniff Peter’s hair.]

May: And take a shower. You smell. You smell like garbage.

Peter: I know.

[Through a window, we see Peter facing Principal Morita.]

Principal Morita: Peter, you’re a good kid and you’re a smart kid. So just try to keep your head straight, okay?

Peter: Okay.

Principal Morita: All right. Get out of here.

[Peter takes his bag, exits the principal’s office. Ned is waiting for him in the hallway.]

Ned: Are you expelled? Do you have to go to that high school on 46th where the principal has a crossbow?

Peter: Pretty sure that’s an urban myth, and no, I’m not expelled.

Ned: You’re so lucky.

[They walk down the corridor. Tilt up to find a homecoming banner hanging from the ceiling.]

[Peter is resting his head on the desk at detention. He turns to find Michelle holding up a sketch of him with a sad expression.]

[We are now in Spanish class. The clock is ticking. A hand holding a blue pen shoots into frame. It’s Peter.]

Peter: Me gusta hacer la tarea. (I like doing homework.)

Spanish Teacher: Muy bueno, señor Parker. (Very good, Mr. Parker.)

[Peter and Ned finish building the Lego Death Star in the orchestra practice room. Ned hands Peter the Palpatine figure, which Peter places on the top. They do a secret handshake.]

[School bell rings. Peter walks out into an empty hallway and sees Liz.]

Peter: Hey.

Liz: Hey.

Peter: I thought you had calculus fifth period.

Liz: Yeah, I was just doing some homecoming stuff.

[Peter approaches Liz.]

Peter: Hey, look, I, uh... I just wanted to apologize about the whole Decathlon thing. I really-

Liz: It’s fine. Last week, Decathlon was the most important thing, but then I almost died.

Peter: No, I, I just mean that... it was not cool, especially... (sighs) ...because... I like you.

Liz: I know.

[Peter stares at her, shocked.]

Peter: You do?

Liz: You’re terrible at keeping secrets.

Peter: (smiles) Yeah, you’d be surprised.

[An awkward moment. They look at each other.]

Peter: I got to get to class, but, um, I’d say we should hang out, but I’m gonna be in detention for...

Liz: Uh-huh.

Peter: ...ever, but, um, I guess you already have a date to homecoming.

Liz: Actually, I was so busy planning it I never really got around to that part, so...

[Liz shakes her head.]

Peter: Uh, do you want to go with me?

Liz: (smiles) Yeah. Sure.

Peter: Really? I mean, uh, great. Cool.

Liz: Cool.

Peter: I’m actually going that way.

[Carrying the hall pass, Peter walks past Liz. We see her turning to watch him go in the background. A huge grin breaks across Peter’s face.]

[In his apartment, Peter slides into the kitchen with a frenzied look.]

Peter: May, I need your help.

[May stares at him with a surprised expression. Peter picks out a dress shirt and tie, polishes his shoes, shakes his head in front of a mirror. May prepares a pink ribbon corsage for him. Peter sprays a perfume in the air to test it, then grimaces at the scent. May and Peter watch a YouTube video on how to tie a Windsor knot. Peter turns to May with a surprisingly passable Windsor knot; overlooking his lopsided shirt collar, that is.]

May: Right?

[Peter is now fully dressed in a suit. May teaches him how to dance, then straightens his clothes.]

[May’s car comes to a stop in front of Liz’s house.]

May: It’s game day. So, what’s the plan?

Peter: Open the door for her.

May: Mm-hmm.

Peter: Tell her she looks nice, but not too much because that’s creepy.

May: Don’t be creepy.

Peter: No. And, uh, when I dance with her, I’m putting my hands on her hips. I got this.

[Peter gets out of the car and leans into the car window.]

Peter: Love you.

May: Bye.

[Peter walks up to the front door, pink corsage in hand, then rings the doorbell. He waits with a nervous look for the door to open. With Toomes on the other side. Peter’s smile fades and he freezes. Toomes grins at him.]

Toomes: You must be Peter.

Peter: Yeah.

Toomes: I’m Liz’s dad. Put her there.

[They shake hands.]

Toomes: Hell of a grip. Come on in here. Come on.

[Toomes drags Peter inside and closes the door. Peter follows Toomes towards the kitchen. Suddenly:]

Doris: Hi, Peter. You look very handsome.

Peter: Thank you.

Doris: (whispers) You got his name right?

Toomes: Freddie?

Doris: Peter.

Toomes: Peter, Peter.

[Doris chuckles and shakes her head.]

Doris: I’m gonna go get Liz.

Peter: Okay.

[She walks out, leaving Peter with Toomes. Toomes starts to polish knives.]

Toomes: You all right, Pete?

Peter: Yeah.

Toomes: Because you look pale. You want something to drink? Like a bourbon or a scotch, or something like that?

Peter: I’m not old enough to drink.

Toomes: That’s the right answer.

[Toomes’ eyes widen as he sees his daughter dressed in a beautiful red dress.]

Toomes: Wow.

[Peter turns in order to see Liz.]

Toomes: Wow, wow, wow. Do you look beautiful.

Liz: Please don’t embarrass me, Dad.

Toomes: Doesn’t she, Pete?

[Liz moves to stand next to Peter.]

Peter: Yeah, you look really good.

Toomes: Once again, that’s the right answer.

Liz: Is that a corsage?

[Staring at Toomes, Peter abruptly hands the corsage to Liz.]

Liz: Thanks.

Toomes: Well, hey, I’m your chauffeur, so, uh, let’s get this show on the road.

Doris: No, no, no, no, we have to take some pictures, babe. All right. Oh, right here. Perfect.

Liz: Mom.

Doris: Okay. Come on, you guys. Peter, closer.

[Peter stands beside Liz.]

Doris: Smile. There you go.

[Liz’s mother takes some more snaps. Peter puts on a tense grin for the photo, his eyes still glued on Toomes.]

Peter: Sir, you don’t have to drive us.

Toomes: No, no, it’s not a big deal. I’m going out of town. It’s right on my way.

[Liz goes to her mother to check the photos.]

Doris: He’s always coming and going.

Toomes: Last time.

Doris: Have fun.

[Doris hugs her daughter.]

Liz: Thank you.

Toomes: Promise.

Doris: (whispers) He’s cute.

Liz: Shh.

Toomes: See you in a couple of days.

Doris: Bye, baby.

Toomes: All right.

[Doris and Adrian Toomes kiss each other.]

Toomes: Come on, Pedro.

Doris: Bye, Peter. Have fun.

Peter: Yeah, I will.

[Toomes is driving. Liz looks at herself through her phone camera, wearing the corsage Peter gave her, while Peter stares out the window.]

Toomes: What are you gonna do, Pete?

Peter: What?

Toomes: When you graduate, what do you think you’re gonna do?

Peter: Oh, um, I don’t know.

Liz: Don’t grill him, Dad.

Toomes: Just saying, you know. All you guys who go to that school, you pretty much have your life planned out, right?

Peter: Yeah, no, I’m just a sophomore.

Liz: Peter has an internship with Tony Stark. So I think he doesn’t have to worry.

Toomes: Really?

Liz: Mm-hmm.

Toomes: Stark?

Liz: So cool.

Toomes: What do you do?

Peter: Yeah, actually, I don’t intern for him anymore.

[Liz turns to Peter, frowning.]

Liz: Seriously?

Peter: Yeah, it got, um... boring.

Liz: It was boring? You got to hang out with Spider-Man.

Toomes: Really? Spider-Man? Wow. What’s he like?

Peter: Yeah, he’s nice. Nice man. Solid dude.

Toomes: Hmm.

[Liz shows Peter her phone.]

Liz: Look, so cute.

Peter: Aww...

[Toomes keeps stealing glances at Peter.]

Toomes: I’ve seen you around, right? I mean... Somewhere. We’ve, uh, have we ever? Because even the voice...

Liz: Um, he does Academic Decathlon with me.

Toomes: Oh.

Liz: And he was at my party.

Toomes: Ah.

Peter: It was a great party, really great, yeah. Beautiful house, a lot of windows.

[Peter and Liz smile at each other.]

Liz: You were there for, like, two seconds.

Peter: That was... I was there longer than two seconds.

Liz: You disappeared.

Peter: No, no. I did not disappear.

Liz: Yes, you did. You disappeared like you always do. Like you did in D.C., too.

[Toomes glances at Peter suspiciously. He stops at an intersection.]

Toomes: That’s terrible, what happened down there in D.C., though. Were you scared?

[Peter nods tersely.]

Toomes: I’ll bet you were glad when your old pal Spider-Man showed up in the elevator, though, huh?

[Peter glances at Liz, then:]

Peter: Yeah, well, I actually didn’t go up. I saw it all from the ground.

Liz: Yeah.

[Toomes stares at Peter through the rearview mirror.]

Peter: Very lucky that he was there that day.

Toomes: (grins) Good old Spider-Man.

[The traffic light turns green. Car honks blare behind them.]

Liz: Dad, the light.

[Toomes continues driving and arrives at Midtown High. Outside, well-dressed teenagers are walking to the entrance decorated with colorful balloons.]

Toomes: Here we are. End of the line.

Liz: Thanks, Dad.

Toomes: You head in there, gumdrop. I’m gonna give Peter the, uh, the “dad talk.”

Liz: (to Peter) Don’t let him intimidate you.

[Liz kisses her dad on the cheek.]

Liz: Love you.

Toomes: Love you, gumdrop.

Liz: Have a safe flight.

[Liz gets out of the car and joins her friends.]

Liz: Hi! You guys look so pretty.

[Toomes turns to Peter with a gun.]

Toomes: Does she know?

Peter: Know what?

Toomes: So she doesn’t. Good. Close to the vest. I admire that. I’ve got a few secrets of my own. Of all the reasons I didn’t want my daughter to date...

[Toomes cracks a grin and shrugs, but Peter does not say anything.]

Toomes: Peter, nothing is more important than family. You saved my daughter’s life. I could never forget something like that. So I’m gonna give you one chance. Are you ready? You walk through those doors, you forget any of this happened. And don’t you ever, ever interfere with my business again. Because if you do, I’ll kill you and everybody you love. I’ll kill you dead. That’s what I’ll do to protect my family. Do you understand?

[Peter nods, unable to meet Toomes’ eyes.]

Toomes: Hey. I just saved your life. Now, what do you say?

[Peter raises his head and looks straight at Toomes.]

Peter: Thank you.

Toomes: You’re welcome. Now, you go in there and you show my daughter a good time, okay? Just not too good.

[Peter gets out of the car with a tense expression on his face. Toomes drives off. Peter enters the school.]

[Peter walks down the hallway, all sounds muffled as if underwater. He stops and watches his friends through the glass doors. Party in full swing. Spotting him, Ned waves and Michelle gives Peter the finger. A beat, then Peter pulls open the door. Pop music and chattering instantly fills Peter’s ears. Liz is dancing with some of her friends. She turns to Peter when he approaches.]

Liz: Hey. What did he say to you?

[Peter just stares at Liz with an anxious look. Liz realizes that something is off.]

Peter: Gotta go. I’m, I’m sorry. You don’t deserve this.

[Peter hurries away, leaving Liz in the middle of the dance floor. Michelle watches him go, craning her neck.]

[Peter rushes out through the hallway and unties his tie. He lifts a row of lockers with one hand, picks up his homemade Spider-Man suit from under it.]

[Now clad in his homemade Spider-Man suit, Peter exits the school. As he is about to round a school bus, someone shocks him from behind.]

Schultz: He gave you a choice. You chose wrong.

Peter: Ah, what the hell?

Schultz: What’s with the crappy costume?

[The Shocker prepares his gauntlet for another shot. Peter searches for his web-shooter, which has fallen from the impact and is lying on the ground.]

Peter: My web-shooters...

[Peter runs to the web-shooter, but Schultz hits a school bus to attack Peter, then kicks the web-shooter away.]

Schultz: I wasn’t sure about this thing at first, but damn.

[Schultz hits Peter with the weapon, throwing him inside the bus. Peter spots chewed gums under a seat.]

Peter: Ugh. Gross.

[Schultz punches the bus into the air. Peter tumbles as the vehicle lands upside down on the ground. Opening the door, Peter falls out. He slowly crawls to his web-shooter.]

Peter: Why did he send you here?

Schultz: Guess you’ll never know.

[Suddenly, a strand of web attaches itself to the Shocker gauntlet. Reveal Ned holding the web-shooter.]

Peter: Nice shot!

[Peter pulls the web-shooter to himself and traps Schultz against the school bus with a web blast.]

Peter: Yes! Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz’s dad.

Ned: What?

Peter: I know. I gotta tell Mr. Stark. Call Happy Hogan. He’s Mr. Stark’s head of security. And, uh, get a computer to track my phone for me.

Ned: Are you gonna be okay?

[Peter jumps up onto a streetlight.]

Peter: Hurry, we gotta catch him before he leaves town.

[Ned hurries toward the school building as Peter swings away.]

[Flash is driving his annoyed date to the homecoming dance.]

Flash: I’m sorry about dinner, but I know when branzino’s fresh, and that was not fresh, okay? So...

[Flash screams as Peter lands on the bonnet of his car.]

Peter: (in a gravelly voice) Flash, I need your car and your phone.

Flash: Uh, sir, technically, this is my dad’s car, sir. So I can’t...

[Flash watches the Spider-Man drive away in his car and hit a row of bikes. He whimpers.]

[Peter makes a call to Ned while driving precariously. Ned takes it in the library, between rows of computers.]

Peter: (in a normal voice) Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, hey, hey, can you hear me?

Ned: Go for Ned.

Peter: Ned, I need you to track my phone for me.

Ned: Yeah, but where is it?

[Peter's phone lights up in the backseat of Toomes’ car. Toomes is unaware. Ned tracks the signal.]

Ned: Genius move. Okay, he just passed the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.

Peter: Hey, where are the headlights on this thing? I’m in Flash’s car.

[Ned rolls his chair to another computer.]

Ned: I’ll pull the specs.

Peter: Okay, you’re on speakerphone.

Ned: You stole Flash’s car. Awesome.

Peter: Yeah, it’s awesome. It’s awe... Whoa!

[Peter nearly crashes into other cars.]

Peter: Get out of the way, get out of the way! Move! Move!

Ned: Peter, are you okay?

Peter: I’ve never really driven before. Only with May in parking lots. This is a huge step up...

[A car nearly hits Peter, who screams.]

Peter: Hey, have you gotten through to Happy yet?

Ned: Yeah. I’m working on it. I just gotta backdoor the phone system.

[Ned rapidly types, then twirls in his chair.]

Ned: Guy in the chair.

[Toomes checks his watch and heads to an old Brooklyn factory warehouse.]

[Happy pops up on Ned’s computer screen.]

Happy: Takeoff in nine minutes. (to Ned) Hello? Hello? Who is this?

Ned: Uh... Mr. Happy, it’s Ned.

Happy: Who?

Ned: I’m an associate of Peter Parker. Got something very important to tell you-

Happy: You gotta be shitting me.

[Happy’s screen goes off.]

Ned: Damn.

Peter: Hey, Ned, how we coming on with those headlights?

Ned: Uh... Round knob to the left of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.

Peter: Left. Okay. Okay, perfect. So where’s my phone now?

Ned: Um... He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn.

Peter: What? That makes no sense. I thought he said he was going out of town!

[The car is a literal hazard as it drives down the road.]

Ned: Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy. Don’t think he likes you, by the way. It sounded like he was catching a flight. He said something about taking off in nine minutes.

Peter: What?

Ned: He was surrounded by a bunch of boxes.

Peter: Boxes? It’s moving day. It’s moving day! It’s moving day! He’s gonna rob that plane! I gotta stop him!

[Inside Avengers Tower, Happy is talking on the phone, checking Tony’s belongings.]

Happy: All right, wheels up in eight minutes. We just got to load Tony’s old Hulkbuster armor, prototype for Cap’s new shield, and the Meging... the Meg... the... Thor’s magic belt.

[Peter drives down an empty road at a high speed.]

Ned: Okay, slow down. You’re getting close. It’s on your right.

Peter: What?

Ned: Turn right! Turn right!

[Peter shoots his web to make a sharp turn. The car crashes into a streetlight and is almost overturned. It slides down the road on its side, then finally screeches to a stop.]

Ned: Peter, are you okay?

Peter: Yeah. Just keep trying to get through to Happy.

[Peter jumps out of the car.]

Ned: It’s been an honor, Spider-Man.

[Suddenly, the lights come on. Reveal Ms. Warren standing behind Ned.]

Ms. Warren: What are you doing here? There’s a dance.

Ned: Uh...

[Ned hurriedly closes his laptop.]

Ned: (awkwardly) I’m... looking... at... porn.

[We see a small window in the ceiling open. Peter hangs from his web and slowly descends into the building. The room is filled with computers and gadgets. Monitors showing Avengers Tower and the blueprint of Stark’s plane. Peter spots Vulture’s wing suit and goes deeper inside.]

Peter: Hey! Surprised?

Toomes: Oh, hey, Pete. I didn’t hear you come in.

Peter: It’s over. I’ve got you.

Toomes: You know, I gotta tell you, Pete, I really, really admire your grit. I see why Liz likes you. I do. When you first came to the house, I wasn’t sure. I thought, “Really?” But I get it now.

Peter: How could you do this to her?

Toomes: To her? I’m not doing anything to her, Pete. I’m doing this for her.

Peter: Huh, yeah.

[Peter shoots his web and glues Vulture’s left hand against the desk.]

Toomes: (sighs) Peter, you’re young. You don’t understand how the world works.

Peter: Yeah, but I understand that selling weapons to criminals is wrong.

Toomes: How do you think your buddy Stark paid for that tower? Or any of his little toys? Those people, Pete, those people up there, the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want. Guys like us, like you and me, they don’t care about us. We build their roads and we fight all their wars and everything, but they don’t care about us. We have to pick up after ‘em. We have to eat their table scraps. That’s how it is. I know you know what I’m talking about, Peter.

Peter: Why are you telling me this?

Toomes: Because I want you to understand. And... I needed a little time to get her airborne.

[Vulture takes a folding knife out of his pocket. Vulture’s wing suit flies out from behind Peter’s back, which he avoids. In the confusion of the moment, Vulture cuts free from the web. The wing suit continues to attack Peter, but he avoids it with quick movements.]

Toomes: I’m sorry, Peter.

Peter: What are you talking about? That thing hasn’t even touched me yet.

Toomes: True. Then again, wasn’t really trying to.

[Peter realizes that the wing suit wasn’t attacking him; instead, it was chopping down the pillars. The building collapses, its wreckage raining down on Peter and burying him. Vulture picks up a walkie-talkie.]

Mason: Chief, they’re powering up engines.

Toomes: Okay.

Mason: Come on, come on, come on.

Toomes: Yeah, yeah.

[Vulture takes one last look of the pile of debris covering Peter, then walks away. He pauses to stare at the Avengers Tower. His wing suit attaches itself on his back.]

[The plane is about to take off from the Avengers Tower. Happy walks away from it.]

[We hear grunts and cries. Reveal Peter under the debris, still alive. He panics and takes off his mask.]

Peter: Oh, god. Okay, ready?

[He struggles to get up but fails.]

Peter: Hello! Hello! Please. Hey, hey, please. I’m down here. I’m down here. I’m stuck. I’m stuck. I can’t move. I can’t...

[Peter takes a moment to catch his breath and looks down at his reflection on a puddle. The Spider-Man mask in the puddle covers half the reflection, making it look as if Peter is wearing the Spider-Man mask on half his face.]

Tony: If you’re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn’t have it.

[Once again, Peter tries to push the debris off his back.]

Peter: Come on, Peter. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man!

[Peter finally frees himself from the debris and gets up amongst rubbles. He spots Vulture perching on top of a stripped billboard.]

[The plane takes off from Avengers Tower.]

[Mason is sitting in a control room.]

Mason: Launch for intercept. Green light. Green light.

Toomes: Oh, yeah.

[Vulture spreads his wings and prepares for takeoff. Peter shoots his web and swings onto the billboard, but narrowly misses Vulture, who flies away. Spider-Man shoots his web directly at Vulture.]

Tech: Retro-reflective panels engaged.

[The outer panels of the plane light up and mirror the New York City. Vulture goes after the plane.]

Toomes: Got a visual on the plane, feeling a little resistance.

Mason: It’s probably just a drag on the new turbines.

[Vulture checks behind him but misses Spider-Man, who is hanging from a web attached to his back.]

Peter: Ah! Whoa!

[As Vulture goes higher and higher up, the night view of New York City gets smaller and smaller under Peter’s feet.]

Mason: Look out for the cloaking cameras. Stay in the blind spots.

[Vulture flies to the bottom of the plane and holds on. Peter bumps into the plane a few times, but manages to grab onto it.]

Peter: Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

Mason: Deploy high-altitude vacuum seal.

Toomes: This better work, Mason.

[The wing suit wraps around Vulture like a shell.]

Mason: Trust me, boss. Even one of those boxes and we are set for life.

Toomes: Yeah.

[Vulture puts the matter phase shifter on the plane, creating a small rectangular window, and moves inside. Peter tries to follow Vulture, but loses his grip and almost falls off the plane.]

Peter: Hey! Ah! Whew.

Mason: You have thirty seconds to get to the cockpit and override their security.

[Vulture walks to the front and rips out the door. The cockpit is empty. Outside, we see a blown-up image of Spider-Man crawling down the plane. He must have been caught the cloaking cameras. He approaches the wing suit and tries to open it. Vulture connects a device to the plane.]

Toomes: Cloning transponder signal.

Mason: Launching decoy drone.

[A small drone is launched out from the wing suit, startling Peter.]

Toomes: Entering new coordinates.

[Vulture manipulates the cockpit dashboard, piloting the plane off track.]

[A computer monitor displays the flight course in Avengers Tower.]

Happy: Good, so it’s on its way?

Tech: Yes, sir, right on course.

Happy: Okay, thank you. All right.

[The tech takes the laptop and leaves the almost-empty room.]

[Peter is still struggling to open the wing suit. Inside the plane, Vulture finds the boxes and takes off his mask.]

Toomes: Hot dog.

[Vulture opens one box after another. Rows and rows of Chitauri guns, arc reactors, etc. He takes out an Iron Man mask and throws it on the floor. Peter kicks Vulture’s wing suit and pushes it aside a bit. The air pressure inside the cabin drops, activating the alarm. Vulture checks an external monitor and realizes that Peter has followed him. He growls in anger.]

[Vulture comes out and puts on his wing suit. Peter tries to hang onto the airplane.]

Peter: Just a typical homecoming on the outside of an invisible jet... Fighting my girlfriend’s dad.

[Vulture comes at him and takes out panels right above his head. Peter shoots his web at Vulture. Peter is now suspended in air, one hand holding onto the web sticking to the plane, another hand holding onto the web glued to Vulture. The webs snap off and Peter is sucked in towards the engines.]

Peter: Oh, god!

[He shoots his web to stop the propellers. Vulture, who was also dragged to the engines, escapes death, but his wing suit is a bit damaged. Hanging onto propeller blades laced with spiderweb, Peter sighs in relief.]

Peter: Whew. I can’t believe that worked.

[Suddenly, the propeller falls off. Peter avoids the crisis by holding onto the plane and kicking the propeller off his body. Vulture flies back and attacks Peter. Peter avoids them, but Vulture keeps coming at him. The impact sets one of the engines on fire. Peter clings onto the side of the engine with a thin strand of web.]

Mason: Chief, chief, they’re losing altitude. Get out of there.

Toomes: I’m not going home empty-handed.

[Vulture sets to break open the ceiling of the plane. Still hanging from the engine, Peter sees the plane flying straight at the city.]

Peter: Oh, my god.

[Peter shoots his web at the right wing of the plane and pulls on it to change the plane’s direction. On the streets, passersby watch the plane flying overhead. Vulture tears open the ceiling and holds a box in his claws.]

Mason: Get out of there! What are you doing?

[Peter continues to struggle with the plane.]

Peter: Please turn! Please turn!

[The plane narrowly misses crashing into the city and heads toward Coney Island. Instead of escaping, Vulture tries to hold onto a box.]

[Happy, sitting comfortably in a chair, jumps up. He looks out and sees Tony’s plane flying straight at Coney Island.]

[The plane hits a ride and crash-lands on the beach of Coney Island. Peter loses hold of the plane and rolls down the beach. Everything is consumed in smoke and flames. Peter slowly gets up and takes off his mask. His ears are ringing. He has just staggered up to his feet when, suddenly, Vulture flies toward him and attacks him. Sparks fly from Vulture’s wings; it is clear that he has suffered some serious damage, too.]

Toomes: Hey, Pedro.

[Vulture continues to attack Peter. Peter shoots his web, but misses and gets pinned to the ground like a bird of prey. He screams as Vulture grabs him tightly with his claws and rains down punches at him. When Peter grabs Vulture’s fist to prevent another blow, Vulture flies up and lets go of him. Peter avoids serious injury by shooting a strand of web and holding on to Vulture, but Vulture cuts it off and throws him to the ground. He then slams Peter into the ground a few times. Peter flips onto his back in a sluggish way, then looks up at Vulture, who picks him up by the hood of his Spider-Man costume. Vulture is holding Peter there, studying his limp body, when he spots a crate.]

Toomes: Bingo.

[Vulture lets go of Peter, takes his goggles off, and grabs the crateful of arc reactors. Sparks rain down from his wing suit when he tries to lift the crate, but Vulture does not stop.]

Peter: Your wing suit. Your wing suit’s gonna explode!

[Lifting his weary arm, Peter shoots a strand of web at the crate and pulls with all his might. A tug of war ensues.]

Toomes: Time to go home, Pete.

Peter: I’m trying to save you!

[Vulture cuts the web with his wing and tries to fly off. Peter presses the button on his web shooter, but it doesn’t work. He looks up to see the wing suit failing and covers his head. Vulture drops to the ground along with his wing suit. An explosion consumes him.]

Peter: No.

[Peter struggles up and runs into the flames. He spots Toomes and tries to lift the wing suit off him, but screams as he makes contact with hot metal. However, he doesn’t give up. He picks the wing suit up, finds Toomes, and carries him away from the flames. Peter lays Toomes down on the beach. Wheezing and coughing from the smoke, Toomes looks up at Peter, who returns his gaze.]

[The flames have died out a little. A search party is scouring the beach. Happy finds Vulture tied to a pile of crates with spiderweb. A note is attached beside him: “FOUND FLYING VULTURE GUY. SPIDER-MAN. P.S. SORRY ABOUT YOUR PLANE.” Happy raises his head and looks around as if searching for someone.]

[Fire engines pass by the Cyclone. Peter is sitting on top of it. He closes his eyes, wounded and weary.]

[Midtown High. Students are taking down a homecoming banner. Below it, Ned and Peter walk down the corridor.]

Ned: It looked so insane. That whole... Like, it was just crazy. He, he was just like, “Zzzz,” and you were like, “Ah!”

Peter: Shh.

Ned: And then I just hit him with the “pew.” It was so, oh, my god.

Peter: You saved me. It was awesome.

[Peter spots Liz at the end of the corridor. Her mom is walking beside her with a box full of her belongings. Betty runs to Liz and hugs her. Peter runs toward them.]

Peter: Hey, Liz!

Betty: I’m gonna miss you.

Liz: Bye.

Peter: Liz.

[Liz waits for Peter, wiping tears off her face.]

Peter: Liz, look. I’m so sorry.

Liz: You say that a lot. What are you sorry for this time?

[When Peter fails to answer:]

Liz: The dance? That was a pretty crappy thing to do.

Peter: Well, yeah, but I... I mean, your dad... I can’t imagine what you’re going through. If there’s anything I can do to help...

Liz: (fighting tears) I guess we’re moving to Oregon. Mom says it’s nice there, so that’s cool. Anyways, Dad doesn’t want us here during the trial, so...

Peter: Liz, I... I...

Liz: Bye, Peter. Whatever’s going on with you, I hope you figure it out.

[Liz leaves the school with her mother. Peter watches her go.]

[In the library, Mr. Harrington brings the Decathlon trophy to a table of students.]

Mr. Harrington: Congratulations, Decathlon national champions.

Decathlon Team: (clapping) Yeah!

Mr. Harrington: I’m gonna have to put this back in the trophy case soon, but just for motivation right now at this practice. I’m a little ahead of the game, but we will need a new team captain next year. So I’m appointing Michelle.

[The students turn to Michelle and clap.]

Decathlon Team: Yeah!

Michelle: Uh, thank you. My friends call me M.J.

Ned: I thought you didn’t have any friends.

Michelle: I didn’t.

[Peter’s cell phone vibrates. He picks the broken phone up and reads a message from an unknown number: “Go to the bathroom.”]

Peter: I... I gotta go.

Michelle: Hey, where you going?

[Peter freezes as he thinks of an excuse. Michelle stares at him, eyes filled with suspicion.]

Michelle: What are you hiding, Peter?

[Peter’s lips open, but no sound comes out. Suddenly, a grin breaks out on Michelle’s face.]

Michelle: I’m just kidding. I don’t care. Bye. (to Decathlon team) All right, so we should run some drills.

Ned: Yeah.

[Michelle watches with curious eyes as Peter stands to leave.]

[Peter rounds the corner and finds Happy waiting for him in the bathroom.]

Peter: Hey, Happy. What, uh... What are you doing here?

Happy: I really owe you one. I don’t know what I would do without this job. I mean, before I met Tony-

[A toilet flushes and cuts him off. They awkwardly stand there as Tiny McKeever comes out, washes his hands, wipes them, and leaves the bathroom, throwing a long, confused glance at them. Finally:]

Peter: So, uh, how long you been here?

Happy: Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you.

Peter: (whispers) Is he here too?

Happy: In the toilet? No, he’s upstate.

Peter: Upstate? Like, upstate-upstate?

Happy: Yeah, let’s go.

[Inside Happy's car. Dashboard display says: “You may take your hands off the steering wheel.”]

Happy: Take a look. It’s pretty impressive, huh?

[Outside the window, we see the New Avengers Facility.]

Happy: They just finished remodeling the whole thing.

[Peter studies the facility with an awed expression. We see the reflection of a Quinjet taking off.]

[Inside the compound, Peter watches a Quinjet fly off with a huge grin.]

Happy: You don’t see that every day.

[Tony approaches them.]

Tony: Oh, there they are. How was the ride up?

Happy: Good.

Tony: Give me a minute with the kid.

Happy: Seriously?

Tony: Yeah. I gotta talk to the kid.

Happy: I’ll be close behind.

Tony: How about a loose follow? All right? Boundaries are good.

[Tony playfully punches Peter in the shoulder, then puts an arm around him.]

Tony: Sorry I took your suit. I mean, you had it coming. Actually, it turns out it was the perfect sort of tough-love moment that you needed, right? To urge you on, right? Wouldn’t you think? Don’t you think?

Peter: Yeah, yeah, I guess.

Tony: Let’s just say it was.

[Tony sighs and continues leading Peter towards a door.]

Peter: Mr. Stark, I really-

Tony: You screwed the pooch hard. Big time. But then you did the right thing. Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies... All right, not my best analogy. (beat) I was wrong about you. I think, with a little more mentoring, you could be a real asset to the team.

Peter: To the... To the team?

Tony: Yeah. Anyway... (points at a door) There’s about fifty reporters behind that door. Real ones, not bloggers.

[He presses some buttons on his watch and a secret compartment in the wall opens, revealing a brand new Spider-Man suit, the Iron Spider Armor.]

Tony: When you’re ready... Why don’t you try that on? And I’ll introduce the world to the newest official member of the Avengers: Spider-Man.

Peter: I...

[Peter chuckles, amazed.]

Tony: Yeah. Give that a look.

[Peter continues to admire the Iron Spider Armor.]

Tony: So, after the press conference, Happy will show you to your room, your new quarters. (to Happy) Where’s he between? He’s next to Vision?

Happy: Yeah, Vision’s not big on doors.

Tony: It’s fun.

Happy: Or walls.

Tony: (to Peter) You’ll fit right in.

[Peter hesitates for a moment, then turns to Tony.]

Peter: Thank you, Mr. Stark. But I’m good.

Tony: You’re good? Good? How are you good?

Peter: Well, I mean, I’m... I’d rather just stay on the ground for a little while. Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Somebody’s got to look out for the little guy, right?

[Tony takes off his sunglasses and stares into Peter’s eyes.]

Tony: You turning me down? You better think about this. (pointing at the new Spider-Man suit) Look at that. Look at me. Last chance, yes or no?

Peter: No.

Tony: Okay. It’s kind of a Springsteen-y, working class hero vibe that I dig. Uh, Happy will take you home. Yeah?

Happy: Yeah. (to Peter) Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.

Peter: Thank you, Mr. Stark.

Tony: Yes, Mr. Parker. Very well.

[Tony and Peter shake hands.]

Peter: See you around.

Tony: Okay.

[Peter starts to leave with a spring in his step, but then slows to a stop and turns to Tony, who is putting the Iron Spider Armor away with a tap on his watch.]

Peter: That was a test, right? There’s, uh, nobody back there?

Tony: Yes, you passed. All right, skedaddle there, young buck.

Peter: Thank you, Mr. Stark. Thank you.

Tony: Yeah, thank you.

[Peter walks away.]

Happy: Told you he’s a good kid.

[Tony shrugs. A door behind him opens, revealing a room full of reporters. We can hear their excited murmurs. Pepper comes out with a somewhat frenzied, annoyed look when she realizes that Peter is not there.]

Pepper: Where’s the kid?

Happy: He left.

Pepper: Everybody’s waiting.

Tony: You know what? He actually made a really mature choice. It just surprised the heck out of us.

Pepper: Did you guys screw this up?

Tony: (points at Happy) He told the kid to go wait in the car.

Pepper: Are you kidding me? I have a room full of people in there waiting for some big announcement. What am I gonna tell them?

Tony: Think of something. How about, um... Hap, you still got that ring?

Happy: Do I... I, uh...

[Happy makes a show of patting his pockets to find the ring.]

Tony: The engagement ring?

Happy: Are you kidding? I’ve been carrying this since 2008.

[He holds up the engagement ring. Beat, then:]

Tony: Okay.

Pepper: I think I can think of something better than that.

Tony: Well, it would buy us a little time.

[Pepper kisses Tony with a smile on her lips.]

Tony: Like we need time.

Pepper: I can’t believe you have that thing in your pocket.

[She starts to walk back towards the conference room.]

Tony: Want me to get the door for you, hon?

Pepper: I got it.

[Tony quickly follows her, catching the ring that Happy throws to him.]

[Peter walks out of the facility. A smile blossoms on his face.]

Peter: Aunt May, did you do dinner already?

[Peter enters his apartment and throws his keys on a table. He stops when he finds a brown paper bag that says “This belongs to you. -TS” sitting on his bed. Taking out his earphones, Peter calls out:]

Peter: May?

[No answer. Peter gets into his Spider-Man suit, then pulls off the mask. Reveal May standing in the doorway behind him.]

May: What the fu...?

[Prison. Toomes walks through a cell block. Mac Gargan, the Scorpion, approaches.]

Gargan: Look who it is! What are the odds you and I’d end up in the same summer camp? Relax. This? (points at the scar on his forehead) It’s not on you. It’s on our, uh... little spider friend. I’ve got some boys on the outside who would love to meet him. You know, take a picture, slice his throat, put his head in a dryer. And I heard a rumor... you know who he is.

[Toomes smiles almost imperceptibly.]

Toomes: If I knew who he was, he’d already be dead.

[Gargan stares at him with one eye severely bloodshot.]

Guard: Toomes, your family’s here.

[Toomes walks away, smiling.]

An empty white screen. Captain America enters frame in his uniform.

Steve: Hi. I’m Captain America. Here to talk to you about one of the most valuable traits a soldier or student can have. Patience. Sometimes patience is the key to victory. Sometimes it leads to very little. It seems like it’s not worth it. And you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.

[He uncomfortably glares at someone off-screen.]

Steve: How many more of these?

-FIRE.  NOTHING BUT FIRE.

INT. TIGHT SPACE - INDETERMINATE TIME

Dark and cramped.  The soft red light of fire seeps through 
iron slats.  Inside this cage is a man, bound by chains.

It’s THOR. His beard is long and his clothes are worn. That 
rough, grizzled look of a man who’s spent years on the road.

He awakens with a JOLT.  Looks around.

THOR 
Now I know what you’re thinking.
Oh no!  Thor’s in a cage.  How did 
this happen? 
(then:)
Well, sometimes you have to get 
captured just to get a straight 
answer out of somebody. It’s a long 
story but basically I'm a bit of a 
hero. See, I spent some time on 
earth, fought some robots, saved 
the planet a couple of times. Then 
I went searching through the cosmos 
for some magic, colorful Infinity 
Stone things... didn’t find any. 
That’s when I came across a path of 
death and destruction which led me 
all the way here into this cage...  
where I met you.

Reveal that he’s talking to a weird alien skeleton in chains.

THOR (CONT’D)
How much longer do you think we’ll 
be here?

NOISE.  Sounds of metal gears TURNING.

Suddenly the bottom DROPS OUT!  Thor PLUMMETS until - SHLINK!  
Chains CINCH and abruptly halt his descent.  Thor dangles six 
feet off the ground.  Pull back to reveal we are in-


INT. SURTUR’S LAIR - CONTINUOUS

A cavernous space.  The walls, floors, and ceilings are 
molten rock, which has creepy glimmers of fire within it.  
Stationed in the center is a volcanic rock throne, and 
sitting in that throne is a charred demonic skeleton.

SURTUR (O.S.)
Thor, Son of Odin.

Thor’s chain turns to reveal-

-SURTUR on his throne.  Eighteen-feet-tall, flesh made of 
fire, and demonic spiked horns on his skull.

THOR
Surtur.  Son of a bitch...you’re 
still alive!  I thought my father 
killed you, like, half a million 
years ago.

SURTUR
I cannot die. Not until I fulfill 
my destiny and lay waste to your 
home.

THOR
You know, it’s funny you should 
mention that because I’ve been 
having these terrible dreams of 
late.  Asgard up in flames, falling 
to ruins, and you Surtur are at the 
center of all of them.

SURTUR
Then you have seen Ragnarok, the 
fall of Asgard. The great prophecy--

THOR (O.S.)
Hang on.  Hang on.

Reveal that Thor’s chain is turning VERY SLOWLY.

THOR (CONT’D)
I’ll be back around shortly.  I 
really feel like we were connecting 
there.

After a beat, Thor rotates around to face Surtur.

THOR (CONT’D)
Okay, so, Ragnarok. Tell me about 
that. Walk me through it.

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

SURTUR
My time has come. When my crown is 
reunited with the Eternal Flame, I 
shall be restored to my full might. 
I will tower over the mountains and 
bury my sword deep in Asgard’s--

THOR
Oh, hang on.  Give it a second.

Once again, Thor is turning VERY SLOWLY.  

THOR (CONT’D) 
I swear I’m not even moving, it’s 
just doing this on its own.  I’m 
really sorry.
(then:)
Okay, let me get this straight.  
You’re going to put your crown into 
the Eternal Flame, and then you’ll 
suddenly grow as big as a house--

SURTUR
A mountain! 

THOR
The Eternal Flame that Odin keeps 
locked away on Asgard? 

Surtur grins, evil.

SURTUR
Odin is not on Asgard. And your 
absence has left the throne 
defenseless. 

That elicits a concerned look from Thor.  

THOR
Okay, so where is it? This crown?

SURTUR
This is my Crown, the source of my 
power.

Surtur points at the V-shaped horns on his head..

THOR
Oh, that’s a crown? I thought it 
was a big eyebrow. 

SURTUR
It’s a crown.

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

THOR
Anyway, it sounds like all I have 
to do to stop Ragnarok is rip that 
thing off your head.

Surtur stands up and approaches Thor, DRAGGING his sword.

SURTUR
But Ragnarok has already begun. You 
cannot stop it.  I am Asgard’s 
doom, and so are you.  All will 
suffer, all will burn.

Surtur steps forward and GRABS the chain above Thor’s feet, 
holding it so he and Thor are face to face.

THOR
That’s intense.  To be honest, 
seeing you grow really big and set 
fire to a planet would be quite the 
spectacle.  But it looks like I’m 
going to have to go with option B 
where I bust out of these chains, 
knock that tiara off your head, and 
stash it away in Asgard’s vault.

SURTUR
You cannot stop Ragnarok. Why fight 
it?

Behind his back, Thor opens his hand.  Sending out the SOS.

THOR
Because that’s what heroes do.

Nothing happens.  Thor appears annoyed at himself.

THOR (CONT’D)
Wait, sorry.  I didn’t time that 
right. 
(pause)
And, now!

BOOM!  Thor’s hammer Mjolnir CRASHES through the wall!

Thor BREAKS FREE from his chains, GRABS Mjolnir, spins, and 
flies a distance away. He FLINGS Mjolnir back at Surtur, 
smashing the giant in the face. Mjolnir returns.

SURTUR
You have made a grave mistake, 
Odinson.

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

THE WALLS COME ALIVE!  A seemingly infinite swarm of FIRE 
DEMONS rally to Surtur’s aid.

THOR
I make grave mistakes all the time. 
Everything seems to work out.

In the shadows, a massive FIRE DRAGON ROARS.

The fire demons SURGE FORWARD.  Thor backs up, HAMMERING 
AWAY.  He then leaps back, SPRINGBOARDS off the wall, and-

-LANDS HARD, SLAMMING Mjolnir down.  The resulting shockwave 
KNOCKS BACK THE LEGION OF FIRE DEMONS.

The Fire Dragon STRAINS against a chain leash.

Thor is now facing off with Surtur.  Surtur thrusts his hands 
at Thor, generating a humongous PROJECTILE WALL OF FIRE!

Thor SPINS Mjolnir so fast that it creates a kind of SHIELD.

The God of Thunder and the Fire Giant engage in ferocious 
hand-to-hand combat.  Each landing power shots, sending 
sparks of both fire and electricity into the air.

Thor SLIPS behind Surtur and TAKES OUT his knees.  Thor then 
LAUNCHES HIGH into the air and summons a HUGE LIGHTNING BOLT. 
Descending hard, he uses all his power to-

-LOP SURTUR’S HEAD OFF OF HIS BODY!  Surtur’s body DEFLATES 
and COLLAPSES into a heap of charred bones.

Thor straps the crowned skull to his back. He turns to find-

-the army of Fire Demons regrouping as reinforcements flood 
in, filling the space to capacity.  Recognizing the threat, 
Thor thrusts Mjolnir above his head.

THOR (CONT’D)
Heimdall. I know it’s been a while, 
but I could use a fast exit!

Nothing.  Thor just stands there as the Fire Demons advance.

THOR (CONT’D)
...Heimdall?

At the moment, Skurge is entertaining two ASGARDIAN WOMEN.  

SKURGE
Heimdall was an idiot.  This job 
should have made him rich.  Now, 
the job ain’t easy, but it does 
have its benefits. The Bi-Frost 
gives me access to everything the 
Nine Realms have to offer. I mean 
it’s all mine for the taking.
(beat)
Behold...my stuff.

Skurge has drawn their attention to a pile of weapons and 
treasures he has stashed off to the side.  

He hefts up two M-16 assault rifles, trying to play it cool.

SKURGE (CONT’D)
I’m particularly fond of these. I 
pulled ‘em out of a place on 
Midgard called Texas.  I even named 
them. Des and Troy.  You see, when 
you put them together...they 
destroy.

Thor CRASHES out of the ground and LANDS on a craggy surface.  
Disoriented and singed from the fire demon onslaught.

Thor’s cloak is on fire, and he frantically PATS OUT the 
flames. He picks up Mjolnir, holds it up once more. Nothing.

THOR
Heimdall, come on.

THE GROUND SHAKES!  Like an earthquake.  Thor backs up as the 
ground begins to give way all around him.  And then-

-THE FEARSOME FIRE DRAGON BURSTS OUT OF THE GROUND!  The 
dragon opens its tremendous jaws for an ear-splitting roar...

...but Thor STUFFS Mjolnir into its mouth and lets go.

THUD!  The hammer DROPS, pinning the beast down by its bottom 
jaw.  It THRASHES and GROWLS, trying to break free.

THOR (CONT’D)
Stay.
(looks up to the sky:)
I’m running short on--

Thor notices that all around him the ground is CRUMBLING like 
a field of sinkholes giving way to more snarling Fire Demons!

ASGARDIAN WOMAN
Skurge, is that important?

Skurge turns and notices the Bi-Frost activity.

Skurge has plunged Heimdall’s sword into Bi-Frost.  

BOOM! Thor EXPLODES out of the portal along with the severed 
head of the dragon!  SPLAT!  Blood and guts RAIN DOWN on 
Skurge and the two women, DRENCHING them with purple gore.

The dragon’s head SLIDES slowly across the floor, coming to 
rest right in front of the women who are frozen in shock.

The women SHRIEK and rush out of the Observatory.  Thor 
meanwhile is clean and staggering back to his feet. He looks 
up to Skurge, who is wiping dragon guts off of himself.

SKURGE
Girls!
(beat)
Well well, look who decided to pop 
in.  Thanks for scaring away my 
company and drenching my workplace 
in brains.

THOR
Who are you?  

SKURGE
Don’t you remember?  I’m Skurge.
(Thor doesn’t)
We fought together on Vanaheim.

THOR
Right.  Where’s Heimdall?

SKURGE
That traitor.  No one knows, he’s a 
fugitive of the throne.

THOR
Traitor?

SKURGE
Yeah, you see, Odin charged 
Heimdall with negligence of duty, 
but he disappeared before the 
trial.  Hard to catch a guy who can 
see everything in the Universe.  

Thor starts to say something, but then gives up. Instead he 
starts towards the exit... but Skurge stands in his way.

THOR arrives with Surtur’s skull.

There’s a small crowd making its way through a threshold over 
which stands a monumental statue of Loki, arms out-stretched 
in the ‘savior’ pose.

Confused, Thor turns to a theater patron.

THOR
What the hell is that?

LOKI falls into frame, GASPING FOR BREATH... although it’s 
not Loki. This is ACTOR LOKI and we’re watching a STAGE PLAY. 

In the background, a single musician plays the haunting score 
from THOR: THE DARK WORLD on a pan flute.

Suddenly, ACTOR THOR leans into shot, holding Actor Loki.

ACTOR LOKI
Oh, brother.  This is it.  I take 
my leave.

ACTOR THOR
You fool, you didn’t listen!

ACTOR LOKI
I’m sorry.

ACTOR THOR
Lady Sif!  Get help!

“Sif” awkwardly runs off. The “Warriors Three” watch sadly. A 
small choir JOINS IN as the music builds to a CRESCENDO.

ACTOR SIF
Somebody help!

In the middle of the audience we reveal ODIN, sitting upon a 
chaise lounge, sipping wine and thoroughly enjoying the show.  
Unseen, Thor arrives behind the audience and watches.

ACTOR LOKI
Sorry for all I’ve done. 

ACTOR THOR
It’s all right.   Hold on.

ACTOR LOKI
I’m sorry I tried to rule Earth.

ACTOR THOR
They’d be lucky to have you.

ACTOR LOKI
I’m sorry about that thing with the 
Tesseract.  I just couldn’t help 
myself.

ACTOR THOR
I know.

ACTOR LOKI
I’m a trickster.

ACTOR THOR
So mischievous.

ACTOR LOKI
Sorry about that time I turned you 
into a frog.

ACTOR THOR
It was a wonderful joke.

ODIN
(to no-one in particular)
Twas indeed hilarious.

ACTOR THOR
You are the savior of Asgard.

ACTOR LOKI
Tell my story.

ACTOR THOR
I will.

ACTOR LOKI
Build a statue for me.

ACTOR THOR
We will build a big statue for you.

ACTOR LOKI
With my helmet on, with the big 
bendy horns.

ACTOR THOR
I will tell Father what you did 
here today.

Odin mouths Actor Loki’s final line along with him.

ACTOR LOKI
I didn’t do it for him.

Actor Loki then “dies”.

ACTOR THOR
Noooooo!!!

The brothers freeze in a TABLEAU as ACTOR ODIN steps forward.

ACTOR ODIN
And so Loki died of his wounds, 
giving his life for ours.  He 
fought back those disgusting dark 
elves.  He brought peace to the 
realm.

He takes a 4-YEAR-OLD BOY, PAINTED BLUE, into his arms.

ACTOR ODIN (CONT’D)
Loki, my boy...‘Twas many moons ago 
I found you on a frost-bitten 
battlefield. 

Thor watches, incredulous.  He then notices that a woman next 
to him is openly SOBBING at the play.

ACTOR ODIN (CONT’D)
On that day, I did not yet see in 
you Asgard’s savior.  No.  You were 
merely a little blue baby icicle... 
that melted this old fool’s heart.

The crowd erupts in rapturous applause. The players bow. Odin 
stands up, leading the crowd in this STANDING OVATION.

ODIN
Bravo!  Bravo!  Well done.  Bravo.

THOR
Father.

Odin sees Thor taking a knee.  Curses under his breath:

ODIN
Oh, shit.
(then, announcing)
My son!  Thor has returned! 
Greetings my boy.

Odin goes through a weird internal transformation. His 
fluidity is replaced by a rigid and regal posture. He bats 
away his maiden and turns to Thor, who stands up.

THOR
It’s an interesting play.  What’s 
it called?

ODIN
The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard. The 
people wanted to commemorate him.

THOR
Indeed they should.
(provoking)
I like that statue.  A lot better 
looking than he was when he was 
alive, though.  A little less 
weasely.  Less greasy maybe.

Odin sours, masking his agitation.  Thor holds up the skull.

THOR (CONT’D)
You know what this is?

ODIN (ADR)
The skull of Surtur?  That’s a 
formidable weapon.

Thor approaches an E-Guard and hands it over.

THOR
Do me a favor.  Lock this in a 
vault so it doesn’t turn into a 
giant monster and destroy the whole 
planet.

ODIN
So it’s back to Midgard for you, is 
it?

Thor starts YO-YOing Mjolnir, turns back to Odin.

THOR
Nope.  I’ve been having this 
reocurring dream lately.

Every night I see Asgard fall into 
ruins...

ODIN
That’s just a silly dream... Signs 
of an overactive imagination. 

THOR
Possibly... but then I decide to go 
out there and investigate.  And 
what do I find, but the Nine Realms 
completely in chaos.  Enemies of 
Asgard assembling, plotting our 
demise, all while you, Odin, the 
protector of those Nine Realms, are 
sitting here in your bathrobe, 
eating grapes. 

ODIN
Well, it is best to respect our 
neighbors’ freedom.

THOR
Of course, the freedom to be 
massacred.

ODIN
Yes, besides, I have been rather 
busy myself.

THOR
Watching theatre.

ODIN
Board meetings, and security 
council meetings...

THOR
You really going to make me do it?

ODIN
Do what?

Thor SPINS Mjolnir and then HURLS it off into the distance, 
GRABS Odin by the back of the neck. 

Odin’s royal attendants GASP in shock.  The Einherjar 
bodyguards rush Thor, but he KICKS them away.

THOR
You know that nothing will stop 
Mjolnir as it returns to my hand.

Mjolnir stops mid-air and starts ROCKETING BACK.

Mjolnir approaches at a terrifying speed as Odin struggles.

THOR
Then I’ll see you on the other 
side...brother.

The jig is up.  A shimmering illusion dissipates, revealing: 

LOKI
Alright, I yield!

Thor DROPS Loki to the ground and catches Mjolnir.  Loki 
looks to Thor, hands up defensively.  Skurge arrives on the 
scene, a little late to warn Loki. 

SKURGE
Behold!  Thor..Odinson.

LOKI
You had one job!  Just the one.

THOR
Where’s Odin?

LOKI
You just couldn’t stay away, could 
you?  Everything was fine without 
you.  Asgard was prospering
(gestures to the crowd)
You’ve ruined everything.  Ask 
them.

Those who aren’t freaked out are becoming gradually angrier. 

Thor advances on Loki, who backs up onto the chaise lounge.

THOR
Where’s father?  Did you kill him?

LOKI
You had what you wanted, you had 
the independence you asked for! 

Thor PRESSES Mjolnir onto Loki’s chest.

Reveal Thor and Loki wearing street clothes.  Thor carries an 
umbrella, Loki is dressed in a weird avant-garde suit. 

LOKI
I swear, I left him right here.

THOR
Right here on the sidewalk?  Or 
right there, where the building 
that’s being demolished?  Great 
planning.

LOKI
How was I supposed to know? Can’t

Hey.

dumping.

Thor notices something going on around Loki.

THOR (CONT’D)
What’s this, what are you doing!?

Loki looks down to see that the sidewalk has started to GLOW 
BENEATH HIM!  A circle of ancient symbols. 

LOKI
This... isn’t me.

WHOOMPF! Loki DROPS out of sight, vanishing through solid 
concrete! Thor sees a CARD on the sidewalk where Loki was.

Thor holds up the ratty umbrella, ready to defend himself.

STRANGE (CONT’D)
You can put down the umbrella.

Thor gives Strange a sideways look but then sets his umbrella 
down. When he looks back up, the environment is furnished.

THOR
So earth has wizards now?

STRANGE
The preferred term is “Master of 
the Mystic Arts.”

THOR
Alright wizard, who are you?  Why 
should I care?

STRANGE
My name is Doctor Stephen Strange 
and I have some questions for you. 
Take a seat.

Thor and Strange are now sitting in high-backed chairs. 

STRANGE (CONT’D)
Tea?

Thor now has a cup of tea in his hand.

THOR
I don’t drink tea.

He’s a worthy inclusion.

STRANGE
Then why bring him here? 

THOR
We’re looking for my father.

STRANGE
So.  If you were to tell you where 
Odin was, all parties concerned 
would promptly return to Asgard?

THOR
Promptly.

DR. STRANGE
Great.  Then I’ll help you.

THOR
If you knew where he was, why 
didn’t you call me?

DR. STRANGE
I have to tell you, he was adamant 
that he not be disturbed.  Your 
father said he had chosen to remain 
in exile.
(beat)
And you don’t have a phone.

THOR
No, I don’t have a phone, but you 
could have sent an electronic 
letter.  It’s called an email.

STRANGE
Yeah, do you have a computer?

No. What for?

Strange stands up and suddenly they are standing by a book-
case.  Strange takes down an ancient book, flips through it.

STRANGE
I’m just seeing whether this 
incantation requires any Asgardian 
modifications.

Thor reaches out to the bookcase to steady himself.

STRANGE (CONT’D)
Nope. 

Suddenly they are both across the room at Strange’s work 
station.  Because Thor was touching the bookcase, he has 
magically brought it across the room as well.

STRANGE (CONT’D)
Oh, we don’t need that.

Suddenly Thor is back across the room.  Books fall off the 
shelf and Thor’s beer spills.

He is queasy and unsteady from the teleporting.

THOR
Will you stop doing that?

STRANGE
I need just one strand of your 
hair.

THOR
Let me explain something, my hair 
is not to be meddled wi-!

Strange is behind Thor, he plucks a strand of hair.

Strange extends the hair, infuses it with magic, does a few 
gestures that create a BRIGHT LIGHT and suddenly-

Finally the umbrella flies into his hand. 

THOR (CONT’D)
I suppose I’ll need my brother 
back.

DR. STRANGE
Yeah, right.

Suddenly we hear SCREAMING.

From above, LOKI drops out of a portal.  He LANDS HARD on the 
floor and then STAGGERS to his feet.  On edge, confused.

LOKI

minutes!

DR. STRANGE

You can handle him from here.

A lone figure stands at the other side of the meadow at the 
cliff’s edge, waves CRASHING below.

It is ODIN.  He’s dressed plainly in humble human clothes.  
The boys approach him quickly.

ODIN
Look at this place. It’s beautiful. 

THOR
Father, it’s us.

ODIN
My sons.  I’ve been waiting for 
you.

Loki is surprised to hear Odin call him his son.

THOR
I know.  We’ve come to take you 
home.

me.  Do you hear it?

Thor fires a look at Loki, who holds up his hands in defense.

THOR
Loki, lift your magic.

Odin turns to Loki, who stiffens.  But Odin smiles.

ODIN
Took me quite a while to break free 
from your spell.  Frigga would have 
been proud.

Loki is moved by this gesture. He looks over to see Thor 
staring at him, anger building. 

Odin puts a hand on Thor’s shoulder, calming him.

ODIN (CONT’D)
Come and sit with me.  I don’t have 
much time.

Odin sits, out of breath, weak.  His sons sit beside him.

THOR
I know that we failed you, but we 
can make this right. 

ODIN
I failed you.
(beat)
It is upon us...Ragnarok.

THOR
No, I’ve stopped Ragnarok.  I put 
an end to Surtur.

ODIN
No.  It has already begun.  She’s 
coming.  My life was all that held 
her back, but my time has come.  I 
cannot keep her away any longer.

THOR
Father, who are you talking about?

ODIN
The Goddess of Death.  Hela.  My 
first born.
(faces Thor)
Your sister. 

That hits Thor hard. Loki can’t believe what he’s hearing.

THOR

ODIN
Her violent appetites grew beyond 
my control.  I couldn’t stop her, 
so I imprisoned her.  Locked her 
away.  She draws her strength from 
Asgard...and once she gets there, 
her powers will be limitless.

THOR
Whatever she is, we can stop her.  
We can face her together.

ODIN
(takes Thor’s hand)
No we won’t.  I’m on a different 
path now.  This you must face 
alone. 

Odin looks into Thor’s eyes, struggling to breathe.  

ODIN (CONT’D)
I love you my sons.

For the briefest of instances, father and sons share a quiet 
moment together.  Tears well in Thor’s eyes.

ODIN (CONT’D)
Look at that. 

Ethereal sun-rays stream down upon the ocean.

ODIN (CONT’D)
Remember this place.  Home. 

A warm glow washes over Thor’s face and he turns to see that-

-ODIN IS DISSIPATING INTO STARDUST.  THE ALLFATHER HAS DIED.

A moment as the brothers separately mourn for Odin. 

The sky above DARKENS and THE WIND PICKS UP.

Thor stands and turns toward Loki, his eyes burning with 
rage.  Loki takes a step back.

LOKI

Thor faces Loki.  Electricity CRACKLES at Thor’s hands.

THOR
This was your doing.

CRACK!  Behind them a black portal SPLITS OPEN!

Thor SLAMS DOWN his umbrella, transforming into his Asgardian 
armor (with Mjolnir).  Loki changes into his armor as well.

A piercing scream cuts the air as a figure is hurtled out of 
the portal, crashing out of this dimensional rift is HELA.

Hela takes a second to consider her surroundings.  Then:

HELA
So he’s gone?
(beat)
That’s a shame.  I would’ve liked 
to have seen that. 

A tense moment as they stare each other down. 

THOR
You must be Hela.  I’m Thor, son of 
Odin.

HELA
Really, you don’t look like him. 

LOKI
Perhaps we can reach an 
arrangement.

HELA
You sound like him.

Loki shifts nervously.  Thor’s grip tightens on Mjolnir.

HELA (CONT’D)
Kneel.

LOKI
Beg your pardon? 

Hela MANIFESTS a pitch black blade.

HELA
Kneel...before your Queen. 

THOR
I don’t think so.

Thor winds up and HURLS Mjolnir at Hela... 

- THUD - the mighty hammer comes to a cold stop, against 
Hela’s hand.

Thor is shocked.  He stretches out his hands, trying to call 
Mjolnir back to him.

possible.

HELA SHATTERS THOR’S HAMMER.

The blast of Mjolnir’s destruction sends a wave of energy 
through Thor and Loki who brace themselves against the 
impact.

Thor is stupefied.  In shock.  He looks up to see Hela is 
running her hands back over her head to create the terrifying 
battle headdress.

Loki’s reaction is more panic.  He stands and calls up:

mark, stalling her for a second. But she PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH 
Loki, KNOCKING HIM OUT OF THE BI-FROST. Gone in an instant.

THOR

Hela projects a jet black grappling hook and GRABS HOLD of 
Thor.  Drawing him to her, preparing to finish him off.  Thor 
pulls up his legs, and KICKS Hela with both feet.  This 
effectively dislodges him from her grasp but also...

Volstagg draw their weapons, preparing to engage.

Hela fires TWO BLACK DAGGERS, each one dropping its target to

Hela sees Skurge. Approaches calmly, a vision of death.

With Hela only a few feet from him, Skurge cowers.  Pause.

from a different wormhole!  He rolls out of the way.  THUD!

Thor runs up a dune to get away from the shower of debris.

Thor reaches the top of the dune and finds himself looking 
down on A BEACH in a strange WASTELAND. Camera scans a filthy 
dune littered with SPACE JUNK.

Out across the OCEAN he notices A NIGHTMARE WORMHOLE - a 
giant open cylinder of whirling smoke and lightning storms. 

A loud noise draws Thor’s attention to a HUGE RECTANGULAR 
“SCRAPPER” SHIP hauling a crashed SPACE VESSEL out of the 
water. Beneath the ship are various SCRAPPERS, masked 
humanoids.  The ship is BLASTING WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC.

A Scrapper notices Thor, then signals to his crew.

LEAD SCRAPPER
Are you a fighter or are you food?

THOR
I’m just passing through.

LEAD SCRAPPER
It is food.  On your knees.

Thor reaches out to summon Mjolnir.  A reflex.  Nothing.

The LEAD SCRAPPER levels a MAGNO-RIFLE at Thor and WHAP! A 
solid metal projectile KNOCKS Thor flat on his back. More 
Scrappers attack, throwing nets and firing more projectiles. 
Thor tries to swat them away but they keep coming. The rest 
of the scrappers move in with iron bats and clubs. 

WHOOSH! A second ship arrives, landing nearby. It’s cool, 
sleek, and dangerous, deserving of its name: WARSONG.  It is 
also BLASTING DIFFERENT WEIRD ALIEN MUSIC.

The FRONT of Warsong FLIPS OPEN and a GANGPLANK extends down 
to the ground. The scrappers stop and stare as we TRACK IN to 
a HERO REVEAL of SCRAPPER #142 (S142 for short) - a beautiful 
and ruthless asskicker. 

S142 lifts a half-empty bottle to her lips and CHUGS it.  She 
finishes the bottle and smashes it on the side of her ship. 

SCRAPPER #142
He’s MINE.

She walks down the gangplank... before veering off course and 
FALLING straight off into a pile of TRASH.  She’s PLASTERED.

The Scrappers shrug and start hauling Thor away.

S142 staggers to her feet, takes a deep breath. She holds on 
to a piece of junk as support - some dead beast.  Thor 
continues to struggle with his captors, tangled in nets.

SCRAPPER #142 (CONT’D)
Wait!  He’s mine.  So if you want 
him, you go through me.

The Scrappers start brandishing their weapons. 

SCRAPPER
But we’ve already got him. 

S142 CLANGS her metal gauntlets together which activate. 

SCRAPPER #142
Alright then I guess I go through 
you.

LEAD SCRAPPER
More food.

She holds out her fists as if she’s operating machinery... 

...Warsong WHIRS to life. S142 clenches her fists and we hear 
a horrible SCREECHING NOISE as Warsong OPENS FIRE.

She sweeps her arms out in an arc, the spray of gunfire 
lasting THREE SECONDS. She bangs her fists again, sending the 
ship into IDLE MODE. The Scrappers are now little more than 
tiny pieces of litter covering the beach.

Thor is fixated on this beautiful murderer approaching. One 
final HUGE Scrapper comes at her with a bat.  S142 casually 
GRABS this Scrapper and HURLS him up into the air behind her.

THOR
Thank you. 

From her belt S142 FLICKS a small glowing disc which LODGES 
into Thor’s NECK. Far in the background, the Scrapper she 
threw finally HITS the ground with a loud THUD. 

She holds up a fob device and presses the button - the disc 
blinks and Thor is filled with the pain of a thousand 
screaming squirrels.  He hits the ground, stunned. 

S142 DRAGS Thor towards her ship.

Thor’s eyes lock in on her belt, specifically the fob device 
she used to activate the Obedience Disk/debilitate him. 

SCRAPPER #142
This is Scrapper 142. I need 
clearance and an audience with the 
boss.  I’ve got something special.

THOR
Hey!  Where are you taking me?

S142 ignores him, takes a swig from the bottle, and then 
nonchalantly UNCLIPS the fob from her belt.

THOR (CONT’D)
Answer me! Hey! I am Thor, son of 
Odin.  I need to get back to

Many apologies, your majesty.

We were once the seat of absolute

before me...and rise into the ranks

THE E-GUARDS GET INTO ATTACK FORMATION.

HOGUN
Whoever you are... whatever you’ve 
done, surrender now!  Or we will 
show you know mercy.

This is your last warning!

Fine.

The Asgardian archers LOOSE DOZENS OF ARROWS, but-

SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
Fear not, for you are found.  You 
are home, and there is no going

Thor STRUGGLES against his restraints.

SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
But what is this place?  The answer 
in Sakaar.

The tunnel walls show images of Sakaar’s place in the Cosmos.

SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
Surrounded by cosmic gateways, 
Sakaar lives on the edge of the 
known and unknown.

Images of the wormholes that cover Sakaar’s atmosphere.

SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
It is the collection point for all 
lost and unloved things.  Like you.  
But here on Sakaar, you are 
significant.  You are valuable.  
Here, you are loved.  

THOR
What...the hell?

SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
And no one loves you more than the 
Grandmaster.

Images of the Grandmaster, in silhouette, arriving on Sakaar.

SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
He is the original.  The first 
lost, and the first found.  The 
creator of Sakaar and the father of 
the Contest of Champions.

Images of the arena where aliens battle to the death.

SOOTHING VOICE (V.O.)
Where once you were nothing, now 
you are something.  You are the 
property of the Grandmaster.  
(then:)
Congratulations!  You will meet the 
Grandmaster in five seconds.

Images around the tunnel begin speeding up.  Chaos, violence, 
and confusion mixed in with Grandmaster’s face.

Thor, already bewildered, looks on the verge of panic.

Suddenly Thor is somewhere else, surrounded weirdos and 
insanely dressed palace guards.

His scream dies down self-consciously.

A musical beat PLAYS in the background.

THE GRANDMASTER, a tall mysterious man in golden robes. He is 
looking right at us. He doesn’t know what to make of us. He’s 
curious, thrilled, revolted, and titillated. 

Pulling back we see TOPAZ, his trusty guard, at his side. Two 
GOLDEN LADIES loiter off to the side. Other strange guests 
can be seen in the background. Grandmaster just stares.

S142 stands beside Grandmaster.  Finally:

GRANDMASTER
He’s wonderful.
(then:)
It is a he?

Reveal S142 standing beside Thor.

SCRAPPER #142
It’s a he.

GRANDMASTER
Yeah. I love when you come to visit 
142, you bring me the best stuff.
(to Topaz:)
Whenever we get to talking, Topaz, 
about Scrapper 142...what do I 
always say? “She is the...” and it 
starts with a B.

TOPAZ
Trash.

GRANDMASTER
No, not trash.  Were you waiting 
just to call her that?  It doesn’t 
start with a “B.”

TOPAZ
Booze hag.

GRANDMASTER
I’m so sorry.  No, “best.”  I was 
thinking about “best.” 
(to S142:)
Because I always say you’re the 
best.  She brought me my precious 
beloved Champion, you know.

TOPAZ
You say that every time she’s here.

GRANDMASTER
What have you brought today?  Tell 
me.

SCRAPPER #142
A contender.

THOR
A what?

GRANDMASTER
I need to go closer.  I want a 
closer look at this.  Can you take 
us closer?  Thank you. 

Grandmaster advances on Thor.  Examining him closely and 
strangely.  Then:

GRANDMASTER (CONT’D)
Pay this lady.

THOR
Just wait a damn minute.  I’m not 
for sale.

Using all his might, Thor breaks out of his shackles, but-

-S142 ZAPS him again.  Paralyzed by superheated veins. 

GRANDMASTER
Man.  He is a fighter.

SCRAPPER #142
I’d take 10 million.

TOPAZ
Tell her she’s dreaming.

GRANDMASTER
For heaven’s sake, transfer the

Topaz transfers S142 the units. Without sympathy or ceremony, 
S142 exits.

THOR
You’ll pay for this!

SCRAPPER #142
No, I got paid for this.

Thor claws at the obedience disk, trying to RIP IT OUT. 

He gets some separation from his skin, but the disk is 
causing him even more pain. Thor eventually has to let go.   
Grandmaster holds up HIS OWN fob device and uses it like a 
wand to guide Thor’s HOVER CHAIR, which follows Grandmaster 
around as he speaks. 

GRANDMASTER
Here’s what I wanna know.  Who are 
you?

THOR
I am the God of THUNDER!!!

Thor THRUSTS his arms into the air but only a tiny bit of 
static electricity POPS within Thor’s hands. 

GRANDMASTER
Wow.  I didn’t hear any thunder, 
but out of your fingers, was that 
like...sparkles?

TOPAZ
We located your cousin.

GRANDMASTER
Oh good!
(to Thor:)
Yeah, come on. I think you’re gonna 
like this. 

Grandmaster moves Thor’s chair to another section where-

-COUSIN CARLO is waiting.  He’s strapped to a chair like 
Thor, and he is terrified.

GRANDMASTER (CONT’D)
There he is.  Hey, cuz.  We almost 
couldn’t find you.  What, have you 
been hiding?

Cousin Carlo looks at Thor, cowering in fear.

Hi.

So...

COUSIN CARLO
Please.  I’m sorry.

GRANDMASTER

COUSIN CARLO
Thank you.  Thank you.

GRANDMASTER
You’re officially pardoned...from

Grandmaster casually takes Topaz’s Sakaarian Guard staff and 
JABS it into his cousin’s mid-section-

-CAUSING ALL OF HIS FLESH TO MELT OFF HIS SKELETON!

Carlo SHRIEKS IN PAIN before his vocal cords melt.  Thor 
looks on, in shock.

THOR
Oh, my god!

Liquid Carlo spreads towards Grandmaster.

GRANDMASTER
I’m stepping in it.  I’m stepping 
in it.  Look out!

THOR
(repulsed)
Oh, the smell.

GRANDMASTER
What does it smell like?

TOPAZ
Burnt toast.

haven’t properly introduced myself. 
Come on.  Follow me.

Grandmaster gives Topaz back her staff.

Grandmaster and Thor arrive at a space where A GROUP OF 
MUSICIANS PLAY STRANGE INSTRUMENTS (the source of the music 
thus far).  Grandmaster joins them, still speaking to Thor.

Grandmaster begins PLAYING a strange piano-like contraption, 
riffing a melody over the existing music.

GRANDMASTER (CONT’D)
My name is Grandmaster.  I preside 
over a little harlequinade called 
the Contest of Champions.  People 
come from far and wide to 
unwillingly participate in it.  And 
you, my friend, might just be part 
of the new cast.  What do you say 
to that?

THOR
We’re not friends, and I don’t give 
a shit about your games! I’m going 
back to Asgard!

GRANDMASTER
(amused)
Ass-gard? 
(then:)
One, two, three, four.

Grandmaster really gets into his PLAYING.  Grandmaster’s 
guards and VIP guests start MOVING TO THE MUSIC.

Thor takes a moment to look around at this bizarre spectacle 
unfolding around him.  In doing so, he zeroes in on one 
particular group of VIPS, specifically...

...LOKI! He’s lounging and dressed in Sakaarian garb.

LOKI
There was a wormhole in space and 
time beneath me.  At that moment, I 
let go.

THOR
Loki!? Loki! Over here!

Loki notices Thor.  Blanches a little.  Sidles closer so as 
to speak to Thor without looking like he’s speaking to Thor.

LOKI
Excuse me one second.

THOR
Loki!

Loki hustles over to Thor, SHUSHING him.

LOKI
What?  You’re alive?

THOR
Yes, of course I’m alive.

LOKI
What are you doing here?

THOR
What do you mean, what am I doing? 
I’m stuck in this stupid chair. 
Where’s your chair?

LOKI
I didn’t get a chair.

THOR
Get me out of this one. 

LOKI
I can’t.

THOR
What?

LOKI
I’ve made friends with this man. 
He’s called the Grandmaster.

THOR
Oh, he’s crazy!

LOKI
I’ve gained his favor.. The Bi-
Frost brought me out here weeks 
ago.

THOR
Weeks ago?  I just got here.

Suddenly Grandmaster is right next to them.

In any case, you know this... You 
call yourself Lord of Thunder?

THOR
God of Thunder.  Tell him.

LOKI
I’ve never met this man in my life.

THOR
He’s my brother.

LOKI
Adopted.

GRANDMASTER
Is he any kind of a fighter?

Loki shrugs, gives the universal gesture for “so-so.”

THOR
You take this thing out of my neck 
and I’ll show you.

GRANDMASTER
Now listen to that.  He’s 
threatening me.  Hey, Sparkles, 
here’s the deal.  If you wanna get 
back to Ass-place, Assberg...

GRANDMASTER
Any contender who defeats my 
champion, their freedom they shall 
win.

The thick cell door SLAMS SHUT behind Thor.  Thor gets up and 
immediately begins THROWING his shoulder into the door.  The 
door doesn’t budge, not even a little.

Behind him, KORG, a hulking Kronan rock alien, speaks up.

KORG
Hey!  Take it easy man! 
(Thor looks back)
Over here.  The pile of rocks 
waving at you.  Yeah I’m actually a 
thing, I’m a being.  Allow me to 
introduce myself, my name is Korg. 
I’m kind of like the leader in 
here.  I’m made of rocks, as you 
can see, but don’t let that 
intimidate you.  You don’t need to 
be afraid unless you’re made of 
scissors. 
(GIGGLES to himself)
Just a little rock-paper-scissor 
joke for you.  This is my very good 
friend over here, Miek.  He’s an 
insect and has knives for hands.

MIEK, a slug alien inside a robot exoskeleton, says hello by 
doing some karate moves.

THOR
You’re a Kronan, aren’t you?

KORG
That I am.

THOR
How’d you end up in here?

KORG
Well, I tried to start a revolution 
but didn’t print enough pamphlets, 
so hardly anyone turned up.

But I’m actually organizing another 
revolution.  I don’t know if you’d 
be interested in something like 
that.  Do you reckon you’d be 
interested?

Thor tries to run ahead down the circle and loops back around 
behind Korg.

THOR
How did you...

KORG
Yeah, no.  This whole thing is a 
circle.  But not a real circle, 
more like a freaky circle.

THOR
This doesn’t make any sense.

KORG
No, nothing makes sense here. The 
only thing that does make sense, is 
that nothing makes sense.

THOR
Has anyone here fought the 
Grandmaster’s Champion?

KORG
Doug has. Doug! 
(realizes)
Oh, right, Doug’s dead. That’s 
right.  Everyone who fights the 
Grandmaster’s champion perishes.

THOR
What about you? You’re made of 
rocks.

KORG
Perishable rocks. 
(a pebble FALLS OFF)
There you go. Another one gone. 
Yeah, no, I just do the smaller

Has no one been taught our history? 
Look at these lies.  Goblets and

Asgardians, man.  They are hard to 
perish.

THOR
Asgardian? 

Thor breaks away from the line and runs to S142. 

THOR (CONT’D)
Hey!  Hey!

S142 holds up the fob.

THOR (CONT’D)
Do not zap me with that thing. I 
just wanna talk.  Asgard is in 
danger.

Thor then notices a series of PATTERNED SCARS, or BRANDS, on 
her forearms.  It’s a moment of recognition and disbelief.

THOR (CONT'D)
My God, you’re a Valkyrie. I used 
to wanna be a Valkyrie when I was 
younger...until I found out that 
you were all women.  There’s 
nothing wrong with women, of 
course.  I love women.  Sometimes a 
little too much.  Not in a creepy 
way, just more of a respectful 
appreciation.  I think it’s great 
that there is an elite force of 
women warriors.  It’s about time.

SCRAPPER #142
Are you done?

WARDEN (O.S.)
Lord of Thunder, you’re up.

THOR
Please, help me.  I need your help.

SCRAPPER #142
Bye.

THOR
Fine, then you must be a traitor or 
a coward because the Valkyrie are 
sworn to protect the throne.

S142 finally turns her attention to Thor, intense.

SCRAPPER #142
Listen closely, your majesty. This 
is Sakaar, not Asgard. And I’m a 
scrapper, not a Valkyrie. 

Guards swarm Thor, dragging him back

WARDEN (O.S.)
Bring him in for processing!

VALKYRIE
And no one escapes this place. So 
you’re gonna die anyway.

Despite her denial, Thor has clearly hit a nerve.  And from 
now on we will refer to Scrapper #142 as VALKYRIE.

Valkyrie takes her booze and walks away.  Thor is dragged 
away, passing Korg and the other prisoners.

Thor is strapped to a chair.  Reveal a weird alien BARBER 
(Stan Lee cameo) holding up some rusty shears.

STAN LEE
Now, don’t you move.  My hands 
ain’t as steady as they used to be.

THOR
By Odin’s beard, you shall not cut 
my hair... lest you feel the wrath 
of the might Thor.

Barber activates a menacing CUTTING TOOL.  Thor freaks out.

Please.  Please, kind sir, do not

Hundreds of thousands of spectators packed into the stadium

Find THE GRANDMASTER’S LUXURY SUITE, a VIP box attached to 
the fighting area. The Golden Ladies are in attendance.

Loki lounges in the suite, taking wagers on the fight card.

Grandmaster walks out into the center of the arena.  Suddenly-

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

-THE GRANDMASTER GROWS TO 60-FEET TALL!  This enlarged 
projection of Grandmaster addresses the audience.

GRANDMASTER
Wow!  Look at all of you. What a 
show, WHAT-A-NIGHT!  Who’s having 
fun?  Please, I’m your host.  Big 
round of applause for all of our 
undercard competitors... who died 
so gruesomely. Good sports.  What a 
show! What a night!  This is what 
you’ve come for and so have I.
(applause)
And now, without further ado... 
it’s main event time!!
(INSANE APPLAUSE)
Making his first appearance, though 
he looks quite promising, got a 
couple of tricks up his sleeve. 
I’ll say no more, see what you 
think.  Ladies and gentlemen...
(LAUGHTER from the crowd)
I give to you...Lord of Thunder!

Enter Thor.  Gladiator Thor.  Shaved head, trimmed beard, 
minimalist armor, covered in weapons.  Two swords on his 
back, giant mace in one hand, spiked shield in the other.

GRANDMASTER (CONT’D)
Watch out for his fingers. They 
make sparks.

Thor looks up at the throngs of SCREAMING FANS. And then...

...puts on his helmet.  A badass gladiator variation of his 
classic winged helm.  Thor is ready to rumble.

ABOVE: Find Valkyrie in her Warsong ship, parked amongst the 
other tailgaters.  She POPS open a bottle of booze.  Drinks.

GRANDMASTER (CONT’D)
Okay, this is it.  Let’s get ready 
to welcome this guy. Here he comes. 
He is a creature.  What can we say 
about him? Well, he’s unique. 
There’s none like him.  I feel a 
special connection with him.

Suddenly the floor beneath Thor’s feet LOWERS.  A slow, 
tension-building GRIND as he sees-

-A DOOR across the arena.  Bigger and bigger.

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

The entire crowd is on its feet.  Palpable anticipation.  The 
spotlights change to bright stadium lights.

GRANDMASTER (CONT’D)
He’s undefeated.  HE’S THE 
REIGNING...HE’S THE DEFENDING... 
Ladies and gentlemen... I give 
you...

KA-BOOM!  EXPLODING through a door is the Champion...

...THE INCREDIBLE HULK!  He wears an armored shoulder guard 
and a Spartan helmet.  He carries a warhammer in one hand and 
a battleaxe in the other.  Hulk POUNDS his chest and ROARS, 
further energizing an already frenzied crowd.

Meanwhile, the sight of Hulk makes Thor’s arms drop to his 
sides along with his jaw dropping to the ground.  And then-

-Thor LAUGHS his ass off. Like, “that’s my buddy over there!”

THOR
Yes!

IN THE VIP BOX: Loki goes ghost white.  Traumatic memories of 
being Hulk-smashed flood his brain.  Gone is all his joy.

LOKI
I have to get off this planet.

Loki tries to exit, but the Grandmaster stops him.

GRANDMASTER
Hey, hey, hey! Where are you going?

Grandmaster plops Loki down in the front row, right against 
the glass.  Loki casually tries to hide his face in his hand.

IN THE ARENA:

THOR
Hey!  We know each other. He’s a 
friend from work. 
(to Hulk:)
Where have you been?  Everybody 
thought you were dead.  So much has 
happened since I last saw you.  I 
lost my hammer.  Like, yesterday, 
so that’s still pretty fresh. 
(then:)
Loki!  Loki’s alive.  Can you 
believe it?  He’s up there. 
(waves to Loki:)
Loki!  Look who it is! 

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

Loki is petrified.

THOR (CONT’D)
Banner, I never thought I would say 
this, but I’m happy to see you.

IN THE ARENA: Hulk is still eyeballing Thor while the 
capacity crowd CHANTS insanely for “HULK! HULK! HULK!”

THOR (CONT’D)
Banner.  Hey, Banner!

Hulk’s face grimaces and contorts, suppressing puny Banner.

HULK
NO BANNER!  ONLY HULK!

Hulk CHARGES at Thor.  Insanely fast. 

THOR
What are you doing?  It’s me.

Thor DODGES the first few attacks, but then Hulk SHATTERS his 
shield and sends Thor FLYING. 

Thor draws a sword and STABS it into the ground to slow his 
momentum.  Draws the other sword and faces off against Hulk.

THOR (CONT’D)
Banner, we’re friends.  This is 
crazy.  I don’t want to hurt you!

They engage again.  Hulk KICKS Thor, sending him SLAMMING 
into the wall.

GRANDMASTER
Here we go.

Thor jumps down just in time to avoid Hulk’s warhammer, which 
HITS so hard that it remains lodged in the wall.

With Hulk charging again, Thor RIPS the warhammer out of the 
wall and WALLOPS Hulk with it.

Hulk goes CRASHING alongside the arena.  He ends up sprawled 
out in a pile of rubble, slightly dazed.

GRANDMASTER (CONT’D)
What?

ABOVE:  Val is watching through a set of high-tech 
binoculars.  She reacts to Thor, reluctantly impressed.

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

Thor advances on Hulk with all the swagger.  He takes off his 
helmet and CALLS OUT to Hulk, provoking him. 

THOR
Hey, big guy. The sun’s getting 
real low.

Hulk takes off his helmet.  Scowling.  Teeth GRINDING.

THOR (CONT’D)
That’s it.  The sun’s going down.  
I won’t hurt you anymore.  No one 
will.

WHOOSH!  Thor is suddenly dragged out of frame.  Hulk has 
Thor by the leg and is WHIPPING him against the arena floor.  
Over and over and over again.

IN THE VIP BOX: Loki’s whole mood shifts.  The joy returns to 
his face, like “everything will be alright!”  Loki LAUGHS.

LOKI
Yes! That’s how it feels! 
(to Grandmaster:)
I’m just a huge fan of the sport.

Thor is SMASHED into the floor face first.

Hulk ROARS and RUSHES Thor with his axe.

THOR
All right. Screw it.

CLANG!  The giant weapons CLASH!  Now Thor and Hulk are 
fighting warhammer versus battleaxe...

...and Thor is winning!  He’s getting the better of these 
exchanges, using Hulk’s aggression against him.  Thor 
continually KNOCKS and/or TRIPS Hulk off his feet while 
evading all of Hulk’s best attacks.

THOR (CONT’D)
I know you’re in there, Banner. 
I’ll get you out!

One particular vicious blow DISARMS Hulk, and Thor BREAKS 
Hulk’s axe with the warhammer.  Thor then BASHES Hulk in the 
chest, KNOCKING him to the ground.

THOR (CONT’D)
What’s the matter with you? You’re 
embarrassing me! I told them we 
were friends!

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16
54.


GROWLING, Hulk stands up and HITS Thor with a straight jab 
that sends Thor TUMBLING across the arena.  Hulk immediately 
LEAPS after him and LANDS ON Thor!

Hulk is now on top of Thor as they slide across the arena, 
just PUMMELING him with punches.  Left-right-left-right.  
Thor’s head snaps back and forth.

In the carnage, Thor sees VISIONS OF ODIN.  Then-

-his eyes GLOW WHITE WITH ELECTRICITY.  Like an instinctual 
defense mechanism, Thor suddenly KNOCKS HULK BACK WITH A 
BURST OF LIGHTNING!

Seething with electricity, Thor springs to his feet and then 
BLASTS HULK WITH A MASSIVE LIGHTNING PUNCH!  Hulk is LAUNCHED 
BACKWARDS and Thor hits the ground HARD.

CROWD
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

KORG
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

The crowd gets hushed.  They’ve never seen this before.

IN THE VIP BOX: Grandmaster is pissed.  Loki is amazed.

Hulk and Thor stagger to their feet.  Thor looks at himself, 
a little surprised.  There are still small charges of 
lightning CRACKLING through his veins.    

Meanwhile, Hulk RUMBLES towards Thor and they’re at it again, 
close-quarters boxing.  Thor is winning the exchanges, 
landing BRUTAL PUNCHES to Hulk’s body.  And then suddenly-

-BZZZ!  The Grandmaster ZAPS him with the Obedience Disk fob!  
Thor drops, totally caught off guard!

Hulk plants his feet and JUMPS!  He ZOOMS UP, rocketing out 
of the arena, up-up-up into the sky!  At the apex of his jump 
Hulk clenches his fist and begins a missile-like descent.

Val sees this from her ship and decides to take off, like 
“This fight is over, time to beat traffic.”

KORG (CONT’D)
Another day, another Doug.

Down below, Thor groggily turns over.  He does so just in 
time to see Hulk coming at him like an atom bomb!  

No time to avoid it.  KA-BOOM!!! Right before impact Thor’s 
eyes go lightning white.  Hulk HITS Thor like a meteor.

The impact knocks Thor unconscious and we CUT TO BLACK.  
Linger on darkness for a few beats...and then:

Hela sits on the throne trying to get comfortable, headdress

HELA
What is that noise?

SKURGE
The common folk aren’t exactly 
falling in line.  There’s a 
resistance trying to knock down the 
front gates.

Hela sends her BUTCHER TROOPS to deal with it.

HELA
Tell me about yourself, Skurge. 

SKURGE
Well, me dad was a stonemason, me 
mum was-

HELA

I’ll just stop you there.  What I 
meant was what is your ambition?

SKURGE
I just want a chance to prove

HELA

When I was young every great King 
had an executioner.  Not just to 
execute people, but also to execute 
their vision.  But mainly to 
execute people.  Still a great 
honor.

I was Odin’s executioner.

Hela holds out her hand and uses her powers to FORM A DOUBLE-
SIDED OBSIDIAN AXE, which she offers to Skurge.

and young daughter (8). They’re RUNNING FOR THEIR LIVES.

Hot on their heels are a pair of Hela’s sinister Butchers, 
hunting like a pack of wolves.

After scrambling through a grove of trees the family make 
their way through a narrow pass. The Butchers are hot on 
their heels, their growls getting louder behind them when - 
BAM! The son runs right into a tall, immovable object...

HEIMDALL! No regal armor, no golden helm. This Heimdall has a

arrive, desperation. 

HEIMDALL
Excuse me.

In one swift motion Heimdall draws the BI-FROST SWORD, steps 
forward and SLASHES through the Butchers, ending them.

He then turns to the family, gestures for them to follow him.

still dirty, bruised, and beat up. 

Thor is being tended to by TWO SAKAARIAN GLADIATOR NURSES who 
are swabbing his wounds. This freaks him out, which results 
in startled thrashing. That freaks out the two Gladiator 
nurses, which results in them RUNNING AWAY.

Thor starts to get up, but then winces.  He moves slowly.

He’s in a GIANT ROOM with stark graphic patterns on the 
walls. With a few achy grimaces, Thor stands up and wanders 
around.  There’s furniture, large cushions, and a sleeping 
area enclosed by the SKULL of a giant beast. 

NOISE behind him.  Thor follows the noise to find-

Hulk having eased himself into a large steaming JACUZZI. Thor 
looks at him quizzically.  Hulk isn’t angry. He’s RELAXED, 
but he’s not turning into Banner. 

THOR
Are we cool?

Hulk grunts.  I guess so.

THOR (CONT’D)
It’s Hulk in a hot tub. 
(then:)
How long have you been like that?

HULK
Like what?

THOR
Like this.  Big, green, ...stupid.

HULK
Hulk always Hulk.

Thor takes this in, and then walks over to a window that 
looks out across the city.  Does some spatial math, realizes:  
Thor looks back out the window.

He sees a ramshackle SPACESHIP taking off and ROCKETING 
skyward.  Higher and higher, it’s going for a wormhole when-

-BOOM!  One of Grandmaster’s Palace Patrol ships, more modern 
and heavy duty, BLOWS it out of the sky.

On Thor, wheels turning.  He turns to Hulk.

Hulk stands up, and exits the hot tub, naked.

THOR (CONT’D)
That’s naked.  He’s very naked. 
It’s in my brain now.

Hulk points out the window.

HULK
Quinjet.

Thor sees the Quinjet in a massive alien junkyard.

THOR
Yes!  I’m getting us out of here. 
This is a terrible, awful place.  
You’re gonna love Asgard.  It’s 
big.  It’s golden.  Shiny.

Hulk sits on his bed, eating a pumpkin.

HULK
Hulk stay.

No, no, no.  My people need me to

prevent Ragnarok.

perimeter sensors in the doorway.

Hulk CHUCKLES at Thor as he hits the floor.  Points.

Thor slumps against the wall, head sagging.

Hulk grabs his giant battleaxe.  He’s armored up.

Hulk exits.  Thor watches him go.  Then, at the end of the 
hallway Hulk meets up with Valkyrie!  They begin play-
fighting, a clearly friendly rapport.

Thor can’t believe it.  He runs to the entrance, but by the 
time he reaches the perimeter sensors they are gone.

Thor sighs.  Walks over to the window.  Looks up through a 
wormhole, stars twinkling on the other end of it.

Thor suddenly finds himself in Asgard.  Disoriented at first, 
Thor turns to see Heimdall hiding in the shadows.

Heimdall harshly SHUSHES Thor and gestures for him to get up 
against the wall.  Thor complies.  Sees the refugees. 

After a beat a roving patrol of Hela’s Butchers creep by 
through the street.  They don’t spot our heroes.  Pause.

Heimdall turns to Thor, speaks only in hushed whispers.

HEIMDALL
I see you. But you are far away.

THOR
What’s going on here?

HEIMDALL
Come see for yourself.

Without warning, Heimdall leads the family out of the alley 
and DASHES down the street.  Thor follows...

...but then stops.  Looks around to see THE OCCUPIED CITY OF 
ASGARD, emitting a smoky aura of chaos. A chilling sight.

Down the street, Heimdall gestures for the family to slow 
down.  He sees something.  Ushers them into an alcove.

Thor joins them just in time to avoid being seen by another 
roving patrol of Hela’s Butchers.  Heimdall again motions for 
Thor to “shh” until the threat has passed.  Then:

HEIMDALL (CONT’D)
I’m providing refuge in a 
stronghold build by our ancestors.  
But if the garrison falls our only 
escape will is Bi-Frost.

You’re talking about evacuating

HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Hela is ravenous. If I let her 
leave, she’ll consume the Nine 
Realms and all the cosmos. 

Turns back to Thor, approaches him.

HEIMDALL (CONT’D)
We need you.

THOR
I’m working on it, but I don’t even 
really know where the hell I am.

Two packs of Butchers arrive simultaneously.  Spot Heimdall.

HEIMDALL
You’re on a planet surrounded by 
doorways.  Go through one.

THOR 
Which one?

Heimdall RIPS into the attacking Butchers, CUTTING them down.

HEIMDALL
The big one!  

WHOOSH!  SUDDENLY THOR’S GONE!  BLACK.

After slashing through the Butchers, Heimdall moves towards 
the house where he hid the family... and then abruptly stops. 

Heimdall turns slightly.  He sees something.

BINOCULARS POV: Heimdall looking right at us, the Bi-Frost 
sword visible in his hand.

Reveal Skurge on a palace tower balcony, surveilling the city

Valkyrie and Hulk face off.

Val bounds forward and gives The Incredible Hulk a big hug. 
Hulk laughs and then begins playfully roughhousing with Val.

Hulk steps away, allowing Valkyrie to see Thor. Her smile 
disappears. She stares at Hulk, so annoyed.  Hulk mopes a 
little. Like, “I done bad.”  Turns back to Thor:

No, you want to talk to me.

Valkyrie turns to leave.

THOR
(to Hulk:)
I need her to stay.

Valkyrie is at the exit when the UPPER JAWBONE of Hulk’s 
massive skull bed CRASHES into frame, BLOCKING the doorway.  

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16
67.


Val shoots an annoyed sneer at Hulk.  Hulk SNORTS back. 

HULK
Stay!  Please?

Valkyrie looks him up and down. Obedience Disks to the max.

Hulk begins BOUNCING his ball against the wall again.

Valkyrie walks over to Hulk’s bar, picks up an UNOPENED 
BOTTLE of liquor. Hulk snorts, disapprovingly.  Val puts it 
down and finds something cheaper, she pops the cork.

VALKYRIE
All right. Here’s the deal. I’ll 
listen to you till this is empty.

She TIPS BACK the bottle and starts CHUGGING. 

THOR
Asgard is in danger and people are 
dying. We need to get back there. I 
need your help...wow.

VALKYRIE
Finished. Bye.

She has indeed finished. She goes to leave. 

THOR
Odin is dead.

Valkyrie stops short (the BALL BANGING noise continues). Her 
silence speaks volumes.  Thor has a realization.

THOR (CONT’D)
Hela, the Goddess of Death has 
invaded Asgard.

VALKYRIE
If Hela’s back then Asgard is 
already lost.

THOR
I’m going to stop her.

VALKYRIE
Alone?

THOR
Nope. I’m putting together a team.  
It’s me, you, and the big guy.

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16
68.


HULK
No team.  Only Hulk.

THOR
It’s me and you.

VALKYRIE
I think it’s only you.

THOR
Wait.  Just listen.  The Valkyrie 
are legend, elite warriors of 
Asgard.  You are sworn to defend 
the throne.

VALKYRIE
I’m not getting dragged into 
another one of Odin’s family 
squabbles.

THOR
What’s that supposed to mean?

VALKYRIE
Your sister.  Her power comes from 
Asgard, same as yours.

Hulk’s ball rolls into frame.  An off screen GRUNT.  Val 
picks it up and tosses it back to Hulk.

VALKYRIE (CONT’D)
When it grew beyond Odin’s control, 
she massacred everyone in the 
palace and tried to seize the 
throne.  When she tried to escape 
her banishment, he sent the 
Valkyrie in to fight her back. I 
only survived because... 
(trails off, brooding)
Look, I already faced her once back 
when I believed in the throne, and 
it cost me everything.  THAT’S 
what’s wrong with Asgard.  The 
throne, the secrets, the whole 
golden sham. 

Pause.  Thor moves towards Valkyrie, goes to put a comforting 
hand on her shoulder.

THOR
I agree.

Val SNATCHES his hand.  They are close, face to face.

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16
69.


VALKYRIE
Don’t get familiar.

THOR
I agree.  That’s why I turned down 
the throne.  But this isn’t about 
the crown.  This is about the 
people.  They’re dying and they’re 
you’re people, too.

Val SHOVES him away.  Thor stumbles back.  

VALKYRIE
Forget it.  I have.

THOR
(nods, understanding)
Okay.

VALKYRIE
Okay.

THOR
Good. Great.

VALKYRIE
Great.

THOR
Thank you.

VALKYRIE
For what?

THOR
For this.

Reveal that Thor has lifted the fob device off Val’s belt!

THOR (CONT’D)
Didn’t see that did you?

Thor presses the button and ALL THE OBEDIENCE DISKS EMBEDDED 
IN HIS NECK AND BELT POWER DOWN! Confident smirk.

THOR (CONT’D)
There... that’s better.  You know, 
go ahead. Stay here and get drunk 
and enslave people for that 
lunatic. Keep drinking. Keep 
hiding.
(beat)
But me...

Thor gestures for Hulk to toss him the ball.  Hulk does.

THOR (CONT’D)
I choose to run toward my problems 
and not away from them. Because 
that’s what...

Thor HURLS IT at the MAIN WINDOW - It bounces off, hitting 
Thor in the face.  He stands, facing Valkyrie.

THOR (CONT’D)
Because that’s what heroes do.

Thor then SMASHES THROUGH THE WINDOW!  Hulk STANDS...

HULK
Friend Stay!

EXT. GRANDMASTER’S PALACE - DAY

Thor is sliding down the SIDE of the GRANDMASTER’S TOWER. 

He LAUNCHES HIMSELF OFF THE BUILDING and hurtles downward, 
LANDING casually on the street below. Finally free.

Thor is HAULING ASS.

Never slowing down, Thor keeps the top of the arena in sight.

A few blocks back: Hulk is in pursuit.  He’s BUMPING people, 
SWATTING vehicles out of the way, just being a menace.

On Sakaar, the citizens APPLAUD for him!  Even when Hulk 
DEMOLISHES a man’s food cart, the man CHEERS Hulk on!

Thor SPRINTS in.  Looks around.  Man, this place is big.

And then he sees it.  The Quinjet!

The Hulk approaches, scowling.  Any metal that stands in his 
way PEELS BACK. Frantic, Thor turns to the Quinjet’s console.

HULK
Friend stay!

THOR
No, no, no! 

As Hulk enters, he DESTROYS the hull of the Quinjet.

HULK
Stay!

THOR
Stop! Stop breaking everything!

HULK
Don’t go!

Thor triggers a message on the flight console.  

NATASHA (V.O.)
Nice work, big guy.  We don’t know 
where Ultron’s headed, but you’re 
going very high, very fast.

Hulk stops short.  His whole demeanor changes.

Thor steps out of the way so that Hulk can see a recorded 
message from NATASHA ROMANOFF on the console.

NATASHA (V.O.)
...So, I need you to turn this bird 
around, okay? We can’t track you in 
stealth mode...

Hulk is now right up against the console screen.

NATASHA (V.O.)
...So I need you to help me out. 
Okay? I need you to...

HULK
No!  No, Banner!

Hulk CONVULSES.  Drops to his hands and knees.  His whole 
body warping.  Hulk ROARS and GRABS at his face, SHAKING his 
head, trying to fight this back.  But he can’t help it...

...HE’S TRANSFORMING BACK INTO BRUCE BANNER!  The transition 
is rough and chaotic, it’s as if Banner is fighting to get 
out of the Hulk.  Throughout the process, Hulk SMASHES back 
and forth, further WRECKING the Quinjet.  

And then, calm.

Thor rushes to Banner’s side to help ease the transition. 

THOR
Banner. Hey, hey, hey. You all 
right, Banner?  Sun’s going down. 
Sun’s going down.  That’s it, 
breathe. I won’t hurt you. Sun’s 
going down.

BANNER
...Thor?

THOR
Yeah.

Banner is groggy, disoriented.  Thoughts, memories, and 
observations begin to flood his brain randomly.  

BANNER
What happened to your hair?

THOR
Some creepy old man cut it off.

BANNER
It looks good.

THOR
Thanks.

BANNER
Where are we?  How’s Nat?

THOR
Nat is good, I’m sure.

BANNER
And what about Sokovia?

THOR
Sokovia?

BANNER
The city, Sokovia.  Did we save it?

BANNER
What are you saying? I’ve been Hulk 
for two years?

THOR
I’m afraid so.

Banner’s eyes BULGE.  Trying to process this information.

BANNER
What the hell happened?

Banner rushes to his feet.  Thor follows.

THOR
Banner, there’s something you 
should know...

Banner goes to the flight console.

Voice Activation required.

BANNER

QUINJET (V.O.)

THOR
(puzzled)
What?

BANNER
Ship’s log...

THE SHIP’S LOG POPS UP ON SCREEN.  

FROM BEHIND THE DISPLAY (within the monitor looking out) we 
see fragmented images of the Hulk’s trip through deep space. 

We see the angry green giant thrash around in zero gravity.

We see Hulk closer to the camera now, looking stressed and 
car sick. 

THROW FOCUS to see Banner’s face watching the video, Hulk’s  
freaked out face is super-imposed over Banner’s freaked out 
face. 

BANNER (CONT’D)
Thor, where are we?

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16
75.


THOR
Yeah, about that.

Banner hears:

GRANDMASTER (O.S.)
It’s bad news, bad news today.  

Banner rushes over to the windshield.  Through it he sees-

-Grandmaster, his hologram projection towering over the city.

GRANDMASTER (CONT’D)
Sakaar, hear ye.  Attention please. 
I have some bad news.  My beloved, 
exalted Champion has turned up 
missing.  Take to the streets. 
Celebrate my champion.

BANNER
Who’s that?

THOR
He kind of runs the place. You 
actually lived in his house.

Back to Banner.  A distant, confused stare.

BANNER
I did?

THOR
Yeah. Quite a lot’s happened. You 
and I had a fight recently.

BANNER
Did I win?

THOR
No, I won. Easily.

BANNER
Doesn’t sound right.

THOR
Well, it’s true.

GRANDMASTER
It seems that that criminally 
seductive Lord of Thunder has 
stolen him away.

THOR
Seductive GOD of Thunder.  We need

Oh, no.  This is bad.  This is

I’m freaking out.

THOR
No, no, no.  Don’t freak out. 
You’re okay.  Put these on.

Thor tosses Banner some clothes.  Banner looks at them.

BANNER
These are Tony’s clothes.

THOR
I know, come on.

BANNER
Is he here?

THOR
No, he’s not here.  But listen. 
Just stay calm, okay?  The sun’s

Loki and Valkyrie are brought before Grandmaster, who has at 
least tripled the amount of bodyguards around him.  

GRANDMASTER
I’m upset!  I’m very upset.  You

Blame.  Right now, that’s the 
mindset that I’m in.  And you know 
who I’m blaming?

Topaz hands the melt stick to the grandmaster.

GRANDMASTER
Why are you handing me the melt 
stick?  He was interrupting. That’s 
not a capital violation. 
(refocuses)
My precious champion has come up 
missing and its all because of that 
Lord of Thunder.  It’s all because 
of him.
(to Loki)
YOUR brother.  Whatever the story 
is.  Adopted, or complicated.  I’m 
sure there’s a big history.
(to Valkyrie)
And YOUR contender. 

LOKI
My dear friend, if you were to give 
me twelve hours I could bring them 
both back to you. 

VALKYRIE
I can do it in two.

LOKI
I could do it in one.

GRANDMASTER
You know what?  I woke up this 
morning thinking about a public 
execution.  But for now, I’ll 
settle for this sweet little “who’s 
gonna get him first?”  So you’re on 
the clock.

Valkyrie exits in a hurry.  Loki follows her.

LOKI
What have you done!?

Val reverses position, putting Loki up against the wall.

VALKYRIE
I don’t answer to you, lackey.

LOKI
It’s Loki.  And you will answer to 
the Grandmaster.

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

Loki moves to reverse position again, but Val BREAKS AWAY, 
drawing her TWO BLADES.  In response, Loki UNSHEATHES two 
long Sakaarian daggers.  They eye each other, and then-  

-FIGHT!  A fast-paced and deadly battle of knives.  After a 
few exchanges, Val connects a BIG SHOT that SLAMS Loki into 
the wall.  He scowls.

LOKI (CONT’D)
Why would you help my brother 
escape with that green fool? 

VALKYRIE
I don’t help anyone.

Loki trails off.  He sees her wrist markings.  A realization.

LOKI
You’re a Valkyrie.  I thought the 
Valkyrie all died gruesome deaths?  

Now Val ATTACKS Loki!  She gets him up against the wall, her 
blade against his throat.  She looks ready to kill him.

VALKYRIE
Choose your next words wisely.

LOKI
Terribly sorry.  Must be a very 
painful memory...

Quick as a rattlesnake, Loki GRABS Val’s head and CASTS an 
illusion.  Val’s eyes CLOUD OVER with darkness as we go to:

EXT. HELA’S DIMENSION - FLASHBACK

A barren black void of death. 

The VALKYRIE, in old school Asgardian armor, charge through 
the DIMENSIONAL RIFT, an open portal to Asgard and the Nine 
Realms. Val witnesses these events as moments frozen in time. 

- Reveal Hela in all her glory, black lightning everywhere.

- Dozens of Valkyrie falling through the dark space. 

- The Valkyrie’s winged horses lay dead on the battlefield.

- Through the open portal we can see the throne of Asgard.

- Hela advancing on the final few Valkyrie - one is Val, 
frozen in fear, shell-shocked.

- Hela FIRING black weapons at Val... 

- One of Val’s sisters DIVING IN at the last second, SHOVING 
VAL back through the PORTAL and taking the fatal hit!

- Val lands hard in the Throne room. 

- Val scrambling to her feet and trying to re-enter the rift 
but it’s too late. It closes, the last image she sees is Hela 
dealing the final killer blow to her doomed Valkyrie sisters.

It’s getting real low.

Would you stop saying that!?

It’s just a planet.  You’ve been on

The whole thing is totally 
different this time.

In the past, I always felt like 
Hulk and I each had a hand on the 
wheel, but this time it’s like he 
had the keys and I was locked in 
the trunk.

THOR
Alright, well, you’re back now, 
that’s all that matters.

BANNER
No, it’s not what matters.  What 
I’m trying to tell you, is that if 
I turn into the Hulk again, Banner 
may never come back.  And we’re 
stranded on a planet that is 
designed to stress me out.

THOR
We’re not stranded, I’m gonna 
figure out a way to get us home.

BANNER
Thank you.

THOR
Not your home, though.  Asgard. 

BANNER
What?

THOR
Listen, my people are in great 
danger.  You and I, we have to 
fight this really powerful being 
who also happens to be my sister.

BANNER
Okay, that is so wrong on so 
many... I don’t wanna fight your 
sister.  That’s a family issue.

THOR
No, she’s an evil being.

I don’t care what she is.  I’m not

BANNER
Wait, you’re just using me to get 
to the Hulk. 

THOR
What?  No!

BANNER
It’s gross.  You don’t care about 
me.  You’re not my friend.

THOR
No!  I don’t even like the Hulk.  
He’s all like... “smash, smash, 
smash.”  I prefer you.

BANNER
Thanks.

THOR
But if I’m being honest, when it 
comes to fighting evil beings, he 
is very powerful and useful.

BANNER
Yeah, Banner’s powerful and useful, 
too.

THOR
Is he though?

BANNER
How many PhDs does Hulk have?  
Zero.  How many PhDs does Banner 
have?  Seven.

THOR
Fine, you don’t have to fight 
anyone.  But we’re in danger here, 
so we have to move.

Thor grabs a towel from the ground next to him. He puts the 
towel over his head.

What are you doing with that?

Banner finds a pair of Stark’s sunglasses in his jacket. 

BANNER
I’ll be Tony Stark.

THOR
What?

BANNER
Yeah.  Tony and the gypsy.

THOR
No, no you’re not Tony.  You’re 
Bruce Banner.

BANNER
Then why did you dress me up like 
Tony?

THOR
Because you were naked.

BANNER
Okay, I’ll give you that.

They stand up. Banner adjusts his crotch. 

THOR
What are you doing?  Stop doing 
that!

BANNER
Tony wears his pants super tight!

THOR
Why are you being so weird?

BANNER
I don’t know. Maybe the fact that I 
was trapped for two years inside of 
a monster made me a little weird.

Banner flashes green.  Thor calms him down.

THOR
Hey.  It’s okay.  You’re good.  
Calm down.  Come on.  Listen, we’re 
gonna go to Asgard and you’re not 
gonna have to think about the Hulk 
ever again. All right?

BANNER
All right.

WHAP!  Banner gets nailed in the face with green paint.

Caught off guard, Thor and Banner are swept off into-

EXT. PARADE OF VICTORS - CONTINUOUS
69A
69A

It’s a massive street festival where revelers dance and cheer 
while throwing powdered paint at each other... in celebration 
of Hulk!  Green EVERYWHERE!

Inside the parade it is total chaos. Thor searches for Banner 
as he’s PELTED with green powder. Pandemonium. In the crowd 
Thor sees a pack of SCRAPPERS on the hunt for the reward.

Thor spots Banner.  He surges forward, GRABS Banner, and 
pulls him into another alley, but sees-

-Valkyrie is approaching from down the alley!

THOR
This is bad.  Banner!  Banner!

Thor pulls Banner back into the crowd. Thor briefly turns to 
see that he is no longer holding Banner’s - it’s the arm of a 
SMALL ALIEN who squeals in fright. 

Thor sees Banner across the crowd.

Thor MUSCLES his way through the madness, knocking rowdy fans 
aside. He reaches Banner and holds him protectively, 
awkwardly trying to rub his shoulders. 

One of the aliens Thor knocked aside turns out to be a 
MASSIVE SCRAPPER.  He rears up, turning on Thor and Banner.  

WHAM!  From out of nowhere, Valkyrie CLOCKS this Scrapper 
with a brass knuckle right cross.  The Scrapper DROPS.

Thor looks at Val while clutching Banner like a child.

THOR (CONT’D)
Hi.

VALKYRIE
What are you doing here?  I thought 
you were leaving.

THOR
I got sidetracked.

VALKYRIE
What’s with the...

THOR
It’s my disguise.

VALKYRIE
But I can see your face.

THOR
(covers his face)
Not when I do this, you can’t.
(then:)
Your hair looks nice. I like what 
you did with it. Change it? Washed 
it maybe?

Valkyrie just rolls her eyes, takes Thor by the arm.

What are those things on her eyes? 
Are those the people that she’s 
killed? She’s so beautiful and 
strong...

VALKYRIE
Look, I’ve spent years in a haze 
trying to forget my past.  Sakaaar 
seemed like the best place to drink 
and forget and to die one day. 

THOR
I was thinking that you drink too 
much, and that probably was going 
to kill you.

VALKYRIE
I don’t plan to stop drinking, but 
I don’t want to forget.  I can’t 
turn away anymore.  So, if I’m 
donna to die, well... it may as 
well be driving my sword through 
the heart of that murderous hag.

THOR
Good.

They arrive at a door.  Before they enter:

VALKYRIE
Yeah.  So I’m saying that I wanna 
be on the team. Has it got a name?

THOR
Yeah, it’s called the Revengers.

VALKYRIE
Revengers?

Valkyrie opens the front door, revealing-

-Loki!  He is as restrained as anyone could be, sitting in

LOKIE
Surprise.

Thor TOSSES a bottle.  It BOUNCES off of Loki’s head.

LOKI
OW!

THOR
Just had to be sure.

LOKI
Hello, Bruce.

BANNER
So, last time I saw you, you were 
trying to kill everybody.  Where 
are you at these days?

LOKI
It varies from moment to moment.

Val’s apartment is a shithole. Bottles everywhere, blood-
spattered clothes in the corner, a knife in the wall, etc. 

Banner gives Thor a look like “she might be crazy.”  Thor 
responds with a “No, she’s cool” gesture.

Val lays something on the bed. Unwraps it to reveal AN OLD 
ASGARDIAN SWORD. Thor’s eyes go wide as she sharpens it.

THOR
Is that... a Dragonfang? 

VALKYRIE
It is.

THOR
My God.  This is the famed sword of 
the Valkyrie.

VALKYRIE
Sakaar and Asgard are about as far 
apart as any two known systems.  
Our best bet is a wormhole just 
outside the city limits.

A nice clean wormhole outside the city.

VALKYRIE (CONT’D)
Refuel on Xandar and be back in 
Asgard in around 18 months.

THOR
Nope. We’re going through that one.

Thor points at the nightmare tornado wormhole over the ocean.

VALKYRIE
The Devil’s Anus? 

BANNER
Wait, whose anus are we going 
through?

THOR
For the record, I didn’t know it 
was called that when I picked it.

BANNER
That looks like a collapsing 
neutron star inside of an Einstein-
Rosen Bridge.

VALKYRIE
We need another ship.  That would 
tear mine to pieces.

She’s right.  We need one that can 
withstand the geodetic strain from

Banner gives Thor a quizzical look.

BANNER
And has an offline power steering

And we need one with cup holders, 
because we’re gonna die.  So, 
drinks!

BANNER
Do I know you?  I feel like I know 
you.

VALKYRIE
I feel like I know you, too. It’s

There are one or two ships, 
absolute top-of-the-line models--

LOKI
I don’t mean to impose, but the 
Grandmaster has a great many ships. 
I may eve have stolen the access 
codes to his security system.

All eyes turn to Loki.  Valkyrie throws her bottle at him. It

access into the garage without 
setting off any alarms?

LOKI
Yes, brother. I can.

BANNER
Okay, can I just... A quick FYI, I 
was just talking to him just a 
couple minutes ago and he was 
totally ready to kill any of us.

VALKYRIE
He did try to kill me.

THOR
Yes, me too.  On many, many 
occasions.  There was one time when 
we were children, he transformed 
himself into a snake, and he knows 
that I love snakes.  So, I went to 
pick up the snake to admire it and 
he transformed back into himself 
and he was like, “Yeah, it’s me!” 
And he stabbed me.  We were eight 
at the time.

Loki suppresses a smile.

VALKYRIE
If we’re boosting a ship, we’re 
gonna need to draw some guards away

Why not set the beast loose?

See, Loki, life is about, it’s

To have you.

THOR
I understand why you’re angry. And 
you are my sister, and technically 
have a claim to the throne. And 
believe me, I would love for 
someone else to rule. But it can’t 
be you.  You’re just...the worst.

Hela puts on her headdress.

HELA
Okay, get up.  You’re in my seat.

The refugees turn to retreat.  Fenris CHARGES!

GUNFIRE FROM ABOVE!

The Commodore swoops onto the scene, Valkyrie manning the 
blaster and FIRING on Fenris, who stops his charge.

As the refugees retreat, they come to a stop because...

...SKURGE IS LEADING AN ARMY OF BUTCHERS BEHIND THEM!

Heimdall and the refugees are now trapped on the bridge

SPLAT!  Banner FACEPLANTS on the bridge, seeming to break 
every bone in his body.  He looks dead.

Pause.  Fenris SNIFFS him curiously. We notice one vein on 
Banner’s neck PUMPING GREEN. Then-

-Banner suddenly EXPLODES UP as THE INCREDIBLE HULK, UPPER-

Val pilots the Commodore towards the battle on the city side

-BOOM! Val LANDS the Commodore on top of them, SKIDDING 
across the bridge, CRUSHING the front line of the Butchers, 
and KNOCKING Skurge aside.  The impact triggers the party 
function, setting off PARTY MUSIC and a FIREWORKS DISPLAY.

Val emerges from the ship in full battle mode. Behind her, 
the Commodore FIREWORKS provide a spectacular HERO BACKDROP. 
She draws DRAGONFANG and smiles as Butchers begin swarming 
towards her. She is where she needs to be. 

Meanwhile, the Asgardians huddle together, packed so tight 
that some begin to fall off the side of the bridge, loved 
ones grabbing them and pulling them back up. There’s no hope.

Heimdall FIGHTS off Butchers, but gets KNOCKED DOWN.  Just as

Hey man.  I’m Korg.  This is Miek.

Miek steps into frame, waving.

KORG (CONT’D)
We’re going to jump on that 
spaceship and get out of here.  
Want to come?

Heimdall is beyond confused, but then... a LOUD NOISE. Hela 
looks down to see-

-EMERGING FROM THE THICK LOW-HANGING FOG IS LOKI! Resplendent 
in horns, arms spread wide, seeming to float towards the 
bridge like a mythical angel of mercy.

LOKI
Your savior is here!

The fog dissipates around him, revealing that Loki’s standing 
on THE GRANDMASTER’S SUPERCRUISER! For reasons that will 
become clear, we will henceforth call this ship THE ARK.

And Loki is not alone. He’s brought along all the prisoners 
from the Contest of Champions. Armed with gladiator weapons.  
The Ark slows to a stop at the middle of bridge.

ABOVE: Even with Hela’s hand on his throat, Thor can’t help 
but smile at the sight of Loki.  Hela however sneers.

HELA
That little shit.

BELOW: Loki and the Sakaarian gladiators JUMP OFF the Ark and 
onto the bridge, joining the fight against Hela’s forces.

LOKI
Did you miss me?  Everybody on that 
ship, now.

The Asgardian refugees begin POURING onto the ark. The only 
way onto the Ark is a narrow plankway, so there is an 
immediate bottleneck effect - thousands of frightened people 
all pushing for a chance at salvation. It’s mayhem.

Loki walks through the crowd to Heimdall.

Thor turns to see his father, sitting where we last saw him. 
Thor falls to his knees.

THOR
She’s too strong.  Without my 
hammer I cannot-- 

ODIN
Are you Thor, God of Hammers?

Thor looks up, meeting his gaze. 

ODIN (CONT’D)
That hammer helped you control your

the source of your strength. 

Odin stands, as does Thor.

THOR
It’s too late. She’s already taken 
Asgard.

This isn’t over.

All around the bridge, our heroes look to see-

-Hela arriving at the far side of bridge.  She is seething 
with power, a vision of death.

Having just come out of this huge battle, they are all weary 
and nursing injuries. Loki and Val are hurting worse than 
Thor.

Hela walks towards them.  Menacing and deliberate.

Thor, Loki, and Val step forward to protect the Asgardians.

Thor ATTACKS.  They CLASH, kicking off this monumental

Thor, but Thor is conjuring powerful bolts of electricity 
with the same speed and ferocity.

Just as Thor is surging with newfound lightning powers, 
Hela’s powers seem to be enhanced as well.

The battle is relentless and fast-paced.  Thor is holding his

Dragonfang through Hela’s chest, effectively PINNING her to

HEIMDALL (CONT’D)
Where to?

THOR
I’m not sure.  Any suggestions? 
Miek, what’s your home planet?

Angle on Korg, who is holding Miek (sans robot exoskeleton).

KORG
Oh, Miek’s dead.  I accidentally 
stepped on him on the bridge, I’ve 
just felt so guilty I’ve been 
carrying him around all day...

BLUE DRAFT 05/20/16

Miek WRIGGLES to life.  Korg lights up.

KORG (CONT’D)
Miek, you’re alive!  He’s alive 
everyone!  What was your question?

Thor looks forward, taking charge of this one.

THOR
Earth it is.

CUT TO BLACK.

THE END.

THOR and LOKI look out the window.

LOKI
Do you really think it’s a good 
idea to go back to Earth?

THOR
Sure!  They love me there.

LOKI
Let me rephrase: Do you really 
think it’s a good idea to bring me 
back to Earth?

Thor smiles, getting it.  Pats Loki on the shoulder.

THOR
Probably not.  But don’t worry, 
brother...I’ve got a feeling that 
everything’s going to work out.

Then through the window, they see-

-THE MASSIVE FORM OF SANCTUARY-2, THANOS’ WARSHIP 
approaching.

FADE IN:

On the blackness of SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn 
with a billion stars. Atop a building, a wrought-iron sign -- 
a HAMMER-WIELDING BLACKSMITH -- spins listlessly in the wind 
as a swirling breeze kicks up. A hint of what's to come.

EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - NIGHT 1

A main street extends before us in this one-horse town, set 
amid endless flat, arid scrubland. A large SUV slowly moves 
down the street and heads out of town.

EXT. SUV - NIGHT 2

The SUV sits parked in the desert. Suddenly, the roof panels 
of the SUV FOLD OPEN. The underside of the panels house a 
variety of hand-built ASTRONOMICAL DEVICES, which now point 
at the sky. JANE FOSTER (late 20's) pops her head through 
the roof. She positions a MAGNETOMETER, so its monitor 
calibrates with the constellations above. It appears to be 
cobbled together from spare parts of other devices.

JANE
Hurry!

We hear a loud BANG followed by muffled CURSING from below. 
Jane offers a hand down to ERIK SELVIG (60) who emerges as 
well, rubbing his head.

JANE (CONT'D)
Oh-- watch your head.

SELVIG
Thanks. So what's this "anomaly"¬ù 
of yours supposed to look like?

JANE
It's a little different each time. 
Once it looked like, I don't know, 
melted stars, pooling in a corner 
of the sky. But last week it was a 
rolling rainbow ribbon--

SELVIG
(GENTLY TEASING)
"Racing "Àúround Orion?"¬ù I've 
always said you should have been a 
poet. Jane reigns in her 
excitement. She tries for dignity.

JANE
Hey, Darcy. Pass up the bubbly and 
my gloves, will you? 
(MORE)


Intern DARCY LEWIS (20) hands Jane 
a bottle of Champagne and a pair of 
gloves through the window. Jane 
passes it to Selvig to hold while 
she pulls on the old gloves -- too 
large and masculine for her small 
hands. He starts to unwrap the 
foil, and she stops his hand with 
an excited grin.

JANE (CONT'D)
Not until you see it!

SELVIG
(re: the gloves)
I recognize those. Think how proud 
he'd be to see you now. Jane's grin 
fades to a sad smile.

JANE
Thank you.

SELVIG
For what?

JANE
The benefit of the doubt. The two 
stare out at the sky expectantly. A 
long beat while they scan the 
skies. Nothing. Jane's worried.

JANE (CONT'D)
It's never taken this long before. 
Darcy calls up from the front seat.

DARCY (O.S.)
Can I turn on the radio?

JANE
(an edge to her voice)
Sure, if you like rocking out to 
KFRM, "All agriculture, all the 
time."¬ù

Worried, Jane heads back down into the vehicle.

INT. SUV - NIGHT 3

The SUV is bathed in the glow of high-tech monitoring 
equipment and laptops, some looking like they're held 
together with duct tape. Jane opens a well-worn NOTEBOOK of 
handwritten notes and calculations. Selvig watches the 
frustrated Jane with sympathy.

JANE (CONT'D)

2.


JANE
The anomalies are always 
precipitated by geomagnetic storms. 
She shows him a complicated CHART 
she's drawn in the book, tracking 
occurrences and patterns.

JANE (CONT'D)
The last seventeen occurrences have 
been predictable to the minute... I 
just don't understand. Something 
catches Darcy's eye out the 
driver's side mirror. She adjusts 
it. In the distance, ODD GLOWING 
CLOUDS form in the skies over the 
Northeastern end of the desert.

DARCY
Jane?

Jane SHUSHES her, leafs through her notes. The bottle of 
champagne begins to vibrate.

JANE
There's got to be some new 
variable... Or an equipment 
malfunction...

The lights and equipment in the SUV begin to FLICKER around 
them. The computer monitors SQUELCH with static.

DARCY
I don't think there's anything 
wrong with your equipment... The 
champagne bottle starts to RATTLE 
noisily now as it shakes more 
violently. Jane and Selvig notice.

They watch it curiously, pressure building up inside it, 
when the cork EXPLODES out of it. Champagne goes spewing 
everywhere -- over equipment, over Jane.

DARCY (CONT'D)
Jane?

JANE
What?!

DARCY
I think you want to see this. Darcy 
points out the window. Jane and 
Selvig look out. Over the desert --

3.


MASSIVE CLOUDS OF RAINBOW LIGHT

Churn in the sky. The three stare, dumbfounded.

JANE
Holy. Shatner.

SELVIG
That's your "subtle"¬ù aurora?!

JANE
No-- yes! Let's go!

EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 4

The roof panels still open, the SUV races towards the 
strange event, Jane, amazed by the sight, stands with half 
her body out the roof, taking video of the light storm 
before them. The SUV hits a bump. Jane nearly flies out. 
Selvig grabs her, yanks her back in.

INT. SUV 5

Jane grins, thrilled, pumped with adrenaline.

JANE
Isn't this great?! A thought 
strikes her.

JANE (CONT'D)
You're seeing it too, right? I'm 
not crazy?

SELVIG
That's debateable. Put your seat 
belt on!

The SUV lurches.

EXT. DESERT 6

Winds HOWL around the SUV now. Up ahead, spiraling down from 
out of the clouds comes --

AN ENORMOUS TORNADO

Suffuse with the strange rainbow light, ROARING like a 
thousand freight trains as it touches down.

INT. SUV 7

Selvig looks up through the still-open sunroof at the 
enormous glowing funnel cloud with wonder.

Jane clambers into the front seat, beside Darcy. She leans 
way out the window, TAPING the storm.

JANE
You've gotta get us closer so I can 
take a magnetic reading. Darcy 
laughs.

DARCY
Yeah, right! Good one!
(then, realizing)
Oh God, you're serious...

JANE
You want those college credits or 
not?

EXT. SUV 8

The SUV tears across a field towards the tornado, Jane 
leaning out the window, taping the event. The SUV disturbs 
two RAVENS perched on a cactus as they race past. The birds 
take flight, when -- KRAKABOOM! A huge BOLT OF LIGHTNING 
strikes down through the center of the funnel cloud before 
them with a terrifying intensity.

INT. SUV 9

The SUV rocks from the blast. Darcy's had enough. She turns 
the wheel, starts to head away.

DARCY
Keep the credits. I'll intern at 
Burger King.

JANE
What are you doing?!

DARCY
Saving our lives! Jane grabs the 
wheel, jerks it hard the other way. 
They struggle for control, when the 
headlights fall on --

A MAN
Directly in their path, stumbling 
through the winds. Darcy slams on 
the brakes, Jane turns the wheel 
hard to avoid him. The SUV swerves -
- but too late.

EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 10

The side of the SUV slams into the man with a THUD, sending 
him flying. The car SKIDS to a stop.

INT. SUV 11

Jane, Darcy, and Selvig trade shocked looks, breathing hard. 
They peer through the dust clouds, unable to see through. A 
paralyzed moment, then they all leap out of the car.

EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) 12
12
12

The three race from the SUV with flashlights. Jane spots the 
man lying on the ground. He's dressed in tattered clothing, 
charred and blackened.

DARCY
I think that was legally your 
fault.

JANE
Get the first aid kit. Darcy heads 
back inside the SUV as Jane, 
concerned, kneels next to the man. 
Selvig hovers, protectively. She 
gently turns his head to the light, 
and we see him clearly for the 
first time. He is magnificently 
handsome, long blonde hair flowing 
around his classically sculpted 
features. She cups her hands around 
his face, as if willing the life 
back into him.

JANE (CONT'D)
Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and 
don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes 
and look at me. Suddenly, he 
GROANS, and she's startled, then 
relieved, as his eyes flutter open. 
She looks deep into his confused, 
azure eyes, which at last focus on 
her own. Locking onto them.

For a moment, they each forget to breathe. The connection is 
broken as Darcy returns with the kit. She freezes when she 
sees how gorgeous the man is.

DARCY
Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I 
know CPR.

6.


A flustered Jane smooths her hair and sits back on her 
heels. She looks up at Selvig. Back to being a scientist.

JANE
HIS EYES--

DARCY
(DREAMILY)
--are beautiful.

JANE
--are dilating. That's a good sign.

SELVIG
We still have to get him to a 
hospital.

JANE
(HOPEFULLY)
After we get a reading on the 
storm?

SELVIG
Immediately, Jane. Jane sighs and 
nods, regretfully watching the 
storm EVAPORATE above their heads. 
A thought strikes her.

JANE
Where did he come from? They 
exchange puzzled looks, as we move 
up through the last glowing 
remnants of the storm, and into:

EXT. SPACE 13

13

EARTH spins slowly before us as we hear a voice, deep and 
resonant -- the voice of HEIMDALL, Gatekeeper of Asgard.

HEIMDALL (V.O.)
Questions, they've always asked 
questions -- this race called man, 
on this planet they call earth. 
Passionately longing to know how 
they are connected to the heavens.

We pull away from the planet, widening, past other worlds, 
cosmic debris -- leaving first our solar system, then our 
galaxy.

HEIMDALL (V.O.)
In ages past, they looked to us as 
gods, for indeed so many times we 
saved them from calamity. 
(MORE)

7.


We tried to show them how their 
world was but one of the Nine 
Realms of the Cosmos, linked to all 
others by the branches of 
Yggdrasil... We pull back until we 
see it -- YGGDRASIL. Immense, 
sprawling, like a quasar or a 
nebula twisted into the vague shape 
of a TREE, its branches of glowing 
energy stretching out into the 
black void of space.

HEIMDALL (V.O.)
...the Worlds Tree. Nine Realms in 
a universe of wonder, beauty, and 
terror that they barely 
comprehended.

We move in through Yggdrasil, until we reach what looks like 
a galaxy, slowly spinning before us.

HEIMDALL (V.O.)
But for all their thirst for 
knowledge, they let our lessons 
fall into myth and dreams. Where 
did he come from? He came from us, 
the proudest race of warriors the 
Worlds have ever seen. He came from 
this -- the greatest Realm the 
universe has ever known. We move 
through the galaxy's mists and 
astral matter, then over and up, 
through a band of prismatic color 
to reveal what's on the other side:

HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)
He came... from Asgard!

EXT. ASGARD - DAY 14

Beautiful beyond imagination. We fly over the magnificent 
landscape of the Realm, through the gleaming capital city, 
modern yet timeless.

EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 15

The palace rises countless stories tall, gleaming with an 
other-worldly majesty, towering high above the Realm 
sprawled out before it. We move towards a large window of 
the palace, where a FIGURE

HEIMDALL (V.O.) (CONT'D)

STANDS --

ODIN ALLFATHER
Stares out at his kingdom. The 
ravens fly up to the balcony, land 
at his side.

INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 16

Odin turns away from the window. His wife FRIGGA sits at a 
vanity and tries different earrings before the mirror.

ODIN
Do you think he's ready?

FRIGGA
He thinks he is. He has his 
father's confidence.

ODIN
He'll need his father's wisdom.

FRIGGA
And his humility? Odin reacts.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)
Thor won't be alone. Loki will be 
at his side to give him counsel. 
Have faith in your sons.

ODIN
Yes, but Thor's still a boy. He 
could be a great King... Odin 
stops, notices HIS HAND SHAKING. It 
seems to be out of synch temporally 
with the rest of the world, leaving 
a trail as it moves. He stares at 
it determinedly, concentrating, 
trying to stop the strange event 
through the force of his sheer 
will.

Finally, the occurrence subsides, his hand normal once more. 
A worried Frigga covers his hand with her own.

ODIN (CONT'D)
(QUIETLY)
...if we only had more time.

FRIGGA
For once, our son needs something 
we cannot provide.

9.


ODIN
I can fight it a little longer...

FRIGGA
No. You've put it off too long! I 
worry for you.

He touches her cheek.

ODIN
I've destroyed demons and monsters, 
devastated whole worlds, laid waste 
to mighty kingdoms, and still you 
worry for me?

FRIGGA
Always.

ODIN
Not today. Now come kiss your 
king... while I'm still king. He 
pulls her close, and they kiss.

INT. PALACE ANTEROOM - DAY 17

Directly under the throne room, a gloomily lit hall. Banners 
hang on either side to form a corridor down the middle of 
the fire lit room. Giant doors open at one end. A huge 
figure silhouetted against the bright light beyond walks 
forward. In slo-mo, we recognize the unmistakable shape of 
the God of Thunder. Hammer in hand, he reaches the end of a 
raised platform. An ATTENDANT hands the figure a goblet of 
wine. He downs it quickly, hurls it towards the fire 
directly below.

THOR
Another!

The cup smashes, the alcohol causes the fire to glow 
intensely -- and, for a moment, brightly lit, and seen full 
length, like a King to be, is THE MIGHTY THOR. He proceeds 
down stops, past camera, and down the center of the Hall. We 
follow from behind and see at the other end, massively 
shadowed on one of the great banners, the shape of two great 
horns. As Thor approaches, the horn shapes move, and then, 
from the shadows at the side, emerges LOKI, wearing his 
horned headpiece. Like Thor, he is dressed for a great 
ceremony. They stand by a brazier at the foot of steps that 
lead up to the crowded throne room.

LOKI

(TO THOR)
Nervous, brother?

10.


THOR
Have you ever known me to be 
nervous?

LOKI
There was the time in Nornheim...

THOR
That wasn't nerves, brother. It was 
the rage of battle. How else could 
I have fought my way through a 
hundred warriors and pulled us out 
alive?

The Attendant approaches with another goblet of wine for 
Thor.

LOKI
As I recall, I was the one who 
veiled us in smoke to ease our 
escape.

THOR
Some do battle, others just do 
tricks.

The Attendant stifles a laugh. Loki notices, doesn't like 
it. He gestures towards the goblet in the Attendant's hand. 
EELS pour over the sides of the goblet, slithering out and 
across the terrified Attendant's hand. He SCREAMS, hurls the 
goblet to the ground. Loki chuckles.

THOR (CONT'D)
Loki...

Loki gestures to the writhing eels on the ground. They turn 
back to spilled wine, the illusion shattered.

THOR (CONT'D)
Now that was just a waste of good 
wine.

LOKI
Just a bit of fun.
(to the Attendant)
Right, my friend? The Attendant 
isn't so sure. Thor dons his EAGLE-
WINGED

HELMET.

LOKI
(re: Thor's helmet)
Nice feathers.

11.


THOR
You don't really want to start this 
again, do you, Cow?

LOKI
I was being sincere!

THOR
You're incapable of sincerity.

LOKI
Am I?

He looks his brother in the eye, all pretense lost.

LOKI (CONT'D)
I've looked forward to this day as 
long as you have. You're my brother 
and my friend. Sometimes I'm 
envious, but never doubt that I 
love you.

Thor searches his brother's face, sees no trace of irony. 
He's either speaking from his heart or he's a very, very 
good liar. Maybe both. Thor puts an appreciative hand on his 
brother's shoulder.

THOR
Thank you.

The two brothers take in the moment a beat, then:

LOKI
Give us a kiss.

THOR
Stop.

Thor makes the final adjustments to his ceremonial wear.

THOR (CONT'D)
How do I look?

LOKI
Like a king.

They hear the blast of a CEREMONIAL HORN.

LOKI (CONT'D)
It's time.

THOR
You go ahead.

12.


Loki casts him a wary look.

THOR (CONT'D)
I'll be along. Go on. Loki heads 
inside the palace without his 
brother.

VOLSTAGG combs his great beard in preparation for the big 
event. As he does, he's surprised to find a stray GRAPE 
stuck in the beard. He pulls it out, looks around, then 
eagerly pops it into his mouth and gobbles it down. FANDRAL 
checks his reflection in a mirror, smooths out his 
moustache, gives himself a dashing smile. A PRETTY MAIDEN 
holds the mirror before him, as other MAIDENS look on 
dreamily.

FANDRAL
Thank you, love.
(to the Maidens)

FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Now who'd like to polish my sword 
for me?

The giddy Maidens eagerly raise their hands. HOGUN stands 
staring ahead grimly, his hands folded in front of him, 
amidst the hustle and bustle of the ATTENDANTS and the 
ceremony preparations going on around him. A HELPFUL 
ATTENDANT approaches him and starts to polish his armor. 
Hogun turns his head, gives him a look. Intimidated, the 
Attendant quickly backs away. From behind, we see a WOMAN IN 
CEREMONIAL ARMOR take off her SWORD and set it on a table, 
then her SHIELD, then several HIDDEN DAGGERS and small, yet 
intimidating WEAPONS. We reveal that it's SIF, looking 
radiant. She eyes the weapons on the table.

SIF
(to the weapons)
I'll miss you.

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 18

Colorful CEREMONIAL BANNERS of the Nine Realms adorn the 
room, crowded with AESIR and REPRESENTATIVES from across 
Yggdrasil, all BUZZING with excitement. Thor's COMRADES 
enter and stride to their place of honor at the front of the 
hall. They are:

THE WARRIORS THREE

VOLSTAGG has the girth and strength of a Sumo wrestler, with 
oversized passions to match. 

13.


FANDRAL, the consummate swashbuckler, is agile, charismatic, 
and nattily dressed. HOGUN -- dark, sullen, brooding -- a 
large MACE slung at his side. With them walks the warrior 
maiden SIF. She's clad in armor, a shield and sword at her 
side -- a beauty not to be trifled with.

VOLSTAGG
I hope this goes quickly. I'm 
famished.

FANDRAL
(FEIGNED DISBELIEF)
Noooo!

VOLSTAGG
Are you attached to that pretty 
face of yours? Because one more 
word, and you won't be.

FANDRAL
(to the others)
My, we are hungry, aren't we? The 
others laugh, save Hogun. Fandral 
turns to him.

FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Go on, Hogun. Smile. You can do it. 
Even you, Hogun the Grim. Just one 
smile.

Hogun stares at him grimly.

FANDRAL (CONT'D)
All right, half a smile. Look, 
forget the smile, just show some 
teeth.

SIF
Fandral, is it true the famous 
Warriors Three are ready to meet 
any challenge?

FANDRAL
Name it, Lady Sif.

Thor stands, his fingers nervously drumming the handle of 
his hammer. Frigga approaches behind him, sees his anxiety.

FRIGGA
It's all right to be nervous.

THOR
Why does everyone keep saying that? 
I'm not nervous!

FRIGGA
You may be able to fool the rest of

ASGARD --

THOR
...but never you. I know.

FRIGGA
Thor, just remember that you have 
something even the great Allfather 
never had.

THOR
And what is that?

FRIGGA
Me for a mother. She smiles.

Now don't keep your father waiting. 
Frigga leaves.

Sif and the Warriors Three still wait before the crowd. Loki 
and Frigga enter. Loki takes his place at the front of the 
hall alongside the others. With another blast of the horn, 
the crowd goes silent as the EINHERJAR HONOR GUARD moves 
into formation. They part to reveal --

ODIN
Sitting atop his throne, clad in 
full ceremonial armor. He holds his 
spear GUNGNIR before him. Any trace 
of weakness in him is gone now. He 
exudes all the power and majesty of 
a Ruler of Asgard. Frigga joins him 
at his side. He looks around the 
hall, casts a glance over to the 
Warriors. Thor is nowhere to be 
seen. Odin looks to Loki. 
(MORE)

15.


Loki shrugs. Odin isn't pleased. A 
murmur spreads through the crowd.

VOLSTAGG
(sotto, to Loki)
Where is he?

LOKI
He said he'd be along. Sif realizes 
the truth, shakes her head in 
disapproval.

VOLSTAGG
What?

SIF
He wants to make an entrance.

FANDRAL
Well, if he doesn't show up soon, 
he shouldn't bother. Odin looks 
like he's ready to feed him to his 
ravens.

LOKI
I wouldn't worry. Father will 
forgive him. He always does.

Just then, at the back of the hall, up the steps from the 
lower level --

MJOLNIR
Roars up into the hall, Thor 
strides cockily into the hall 
behind it, catching it behind his 
back. The CROWD erupts in CHEERS. 
Thor spins his hammer with a 
flourish, holds it up before the 
crowd, basking in the moment, 
relishing the adoration, whipping 
his audience up into a frenzy.

SIF
Oh, please.

Odin watches from the front, not liking this showy display.

INT. VAULT - DAY 21

As the sound of the cheers echo from above, the odd, cold 
breeze picks up in the Vault. The Guards rub their limbs to 
warm themselves. They grow increasingly uneasy, sensing 
something's not right. 

ODIN (CONT'D)

16.


They exchange a look, then walk the length of the Vault's 
hallway to its end, where a CASKET sits undisturbed upon a 
pedestal. LARGE SHADOWS suddenly loom over them. They look 
up and SHOUT in terror as they raise their weapons.

INT. THRONE ROOM - DAY 22

Thor finishes stirring up the crowd, then reaches the front 
of the room, kneels on one knee before his mother and 
father. Frigga casts him an admonishing glance. Thor winks 
up at her. She can't help but smile. Odin strikes Gungnir 
upon the ground with a deafening BOOM. The crowd falls 
silent. Odin speaks with quiet, effortless authority. He 
raises Gungnir before him.

ODIN
Gungnir. Its aim is true, its power 
strong. With it I have defended 
Asgard and the lives of the 
innocent across the Nine Realms 
since the time of the Great 
Beginning. And though the day has 
come for a new King to wield his 
own weapon -- that duty remains the 
same. Thor Odinson, my heir, my 
first-born.

ODIN (CONT'D)
So long entrusted with this mighty 
hammer, Mjolnir. Forged in the 
heart of a dying star, from the 
sacred metal of Uru. Only one may 
lift it. Only one is worthy. Who 
wields this hammer commands the 
lightning and the storm. Its power 
has no equal -- as a weapon, to 
destroy, or as a tool, to build. It 
is a fit companion for a King.

INT. VAULT - DAY 23

The bodies of the Guards are flung to the Vault's floor, now 
strewn with ice. We don't see their attackers clearly, just 
catch glimpses of them in the shadows -- but they are large 
and BLUE-SKINNED. One of the creatures lifts the Casket off 
its stand and turns to go. But, as they do, the intricate 
latticework behind the Casket starts to separate and 
retract, revealing something standing in the shadows behind 
it. As the creatures walk away, a fiery glow rises behind 
them. They turn back around. Now it's their turn to SCREAM.

The Ceremony continues.

ODIN
Today I entrust you with the 
greatest honor in all the Nine 
Realms. The sacred throne of 
Asgard. I have sacrificed much to 
achieve peace. So, too, must a new 
generation sacrifice to maintain 
that peace. Responsibility, duty, 
honor. These are not merely virtues 
to which we must aspire. They are 
essential to every soldier and to 
every King. The Crowd and the 
Warriors Three start to shiver and 
rub their limbs for warmth in the 
increasingly cold air of the hall.

Thor turns back to face his father. Odin looks upon his son 
with pride.

ODIN (CONT'D)
Thor Odinson, do you swear to guard 
the Nine Realms?

THOR
I swear.

ODIN
Do you swear to preserve the peace?

THOR
I swear.

ODIN
Do you swear to cast aside all 
selfish ambition and pledge 
yourself only to the good of all 
the Realms?

Beat.

THOR
I swear.

ODIN
Then on this day, I, Odin 
Allfather, proclaim you-- Odin 
hesitates, noticing a strange sight 
before him. ICE creeps across the 
surface of the large banners around 
the hall, making an eerie CRACKING 
sound. Thor, his comrades, and the 
crowd see it too.

18.


ODIN (CONT'D)
(REALIZING)
Frost giants...

The far-off sounds of a BATTLE echo in the depths of the 
palace below. Sif and the Warriors Three reach for their 
weapons, as Thor races from the hall.

INT. VAULT - DAY 25B
25B
25B

Thor enters, then stares shocked at the sight before him. 
Sif, the Warriors Three, and Loki hurry in behind Thor and 
stop short. Shattered and melting ICE is strewn about the 
floor. We don't see the blue-skinned bodies of the Frost 
Giants clearly, just catch glimpses of their twisted and 
smoldering remains on the floor. They've just lost a savage 
battle. Badly. Amidst them, shrouded in shadow, stands the 
black metal creature, a fiery glow coming from within it. It 
is THE DESTROYER. It holds the Casket in its hands.

SIF
The Destroyer.

VOLSTAGG
(AWED)
I thought it was but a legend. Odin 
steps in behind the Asgardians, as 
the Destroyer sets the Casket back 
on its pedestal. It moves back to 
its post, the faint, FIERY GLOW 
extinguishes within it. Fandral 
looks around the Vault, ill at 
ease.

FANDRAL
I've never been inside the Vault 
before. It's said the Tesseract was 
once held here.

VOLSTAGG
(AWED)
The Tesseract? I thought that was 
but a legend too!

SIF
Shush!

Odin surveys the destruction.

19.


THOR
The Jotuns must pay for what 
they've done!

ODIN
They have paid with their lives. 
The Destroyer did its job, and the 
Casket is safe. All is well.

THOR
"All is well?!"¬ù They broke into 
the Weapons Vault! If the Frost 
Giants had stolen even one of these

RELICS--

ODIN
But they didn't.

THOR
I want to know why they--

ODIN
(INTERRUPTING)
The Casket of Ancient Winters 
belonged to the Jotuns. They 
believe it's their birthright.

THOR
And if you hadn't taken it from 
them they would have laid waste to 
all the Nine Realms!

ODIN
I have a truce with Laufey, the 
Jotun King.

THOR
He just broke your truce! We must 
act!

Odin turns to Sif and the Warriors Three.

ODIN
Leave us.

Thor's comrades exit. Odin eyes Thor, as Loki watches.

ODIN (CONT'D)
And what action would you take?

20.


THOR
March into Jotunheim as you once 
did, teach them a lesson, break 
their spirits so they'll never dare 
try to cross our borders again!

ODIN
You're thinking only as a warrior!

THOR
This was an act of war!

ODIN
It was the act of but a few, doomed 
to fail.

THOR
They got this far!

ODIN
We will find the breach in our 
defenses. It will be found, and it 
will be sealed.

THOR
As King of Asgard, I would--

ODIN
You are not King. Not yet. Thor 
sees in his father's face that he's 
pushed this as far as he can. He 
backs away, then leaves, pushing 
through the doors so hard that they 
SLAM backwards behind him. Odin 
watches him go.

INT. BANQUET HALL - DAY 26
26
26

Thor stands in the empty hall, bearing the signs of the 
festivities cancelled due to the events of the day. Anger 
and frustration rising within him, Thor upends one of the 
massive tables. From across the room, Loki watches him.

AT THE BANQUET HALL ENTRANCE

Sif, Fandral, and Hogun follow Volstagg as he enters in 
search of his dinner.

SIF
Redecorating, are we? Volstagg 
surveys the overturned tables and 
food, aghast.

21.


VOLSTAGG
What's this -- ?!

HOGUN
I told you they'd cancel it.

FANDRAL
We thought that was just you being 
your normal cheery self. Volstagg 
looks about the floor, despairing.

VOLSTAGG
All this food -- so innocent, cast 
to the ground. It breaks the heart!

Thor strides away from them to the far end of the hall. Loki 
calmly moves towards him.

THOR
It's unwise to be in my company 
right now, brother.

LOKI
Who said I was wise?

THOR
(re: the empty hall)
This was to be my day of triumph.

LOKI
It will come. In time.

(ADMITS)
If it's any consolation, I think 
you're right. About the Frost 
Giants, about Laufey, everything. 
If a few of them could penetrate 
the defenses of Asgard once, who's 
to say they won't try again. Next 
time with an army?

THOR
Yes, exactly!

LOKI
But there's nothing we can do 
without defying Father. Thor 
considers this, looks at his 
hammer, a gleam in his eye. Loki 
can guess what he's thinking, grows 
concerned.

LOKI (CONT'D)
No... stop there! I know that look!

22.


THOR
It's the only way to ensure the 
safety of our borders.

LOKI
It's madness!

VOLSTAGG
Madness? What sort of madness?

LOKI
Nothing! Thor was making a jest!

THOR
The safety of our Realm is no jest. 
We're going to Jotunheim.

FANDRAL
What?!

SIF
Thor, of all the laws of Asgard, 
this is one you must not break. 
Loki looks on, intrigued by the 
proceedings.

FANDRAL
This isn't like a journey to Earth, 
where you summon a little lightning 
and thunder and the mortals worship 
you as a god. This is Jotunheim.

VOLSTAGG
And if the Frost Giants don't kill 
you, your Father will!

THOR
My father fought his way into 
Jotunheim, defeated their armies, 
and took their Casket! We'd just be 
looking for answers.

SIF
It is forbidden! Thor sizes up his 
friends, smiles. He proceeds to 
make his case with enthusiasm and 
charismatic conviction.

THOR
My friends, have you forgotten all 
that we've done together? He turns 
to Fandral.

23.


THOR (CONT'D)
Who brought you into the sweet 
embrace of the most exotic maidens 
in all of Yggdrasil?

FANDRAL
You did.

THOR
(TO HOGUN)
Who led you into the most glorious 
of battles...

(TO VOLSTAGG)
...and to delicacies so succulent, 
you thought you'd died and gone to 
Valhalla?

VOLSTAGG/HOGUN
You did. / You did. He turns to 
Sif.

THOR
And who proved wrong all who 
scoffed at the idea that a young 
maiden could be one of the fiercest 
warriors this Realm has ever known?

SIF
I did.

THOR
(QUICKLY)
True. But I supported you...
(then, to the others)
My friends, trust me now. We must 
do this.

The others exchange concerned looks, realize there's no 
convincing him.

THOR (CONT'D)
Come on. You're not going to let my 
brother and me take all the glory, 
are you?

Loki looks startled.

LOKI
What?

THOR
You are coming with me...

24.


LOKI
Yes, of course! I won't let my 
brother march into Jotunheim alone. 
I will be at his side.

VOLSTAGG
And I.

FANDRAL
And I.

HOGUN
And I. The Warriors Three fight 
together.

SIF
I fear we'll live to regret this.

VOLSTAGG
If we're lucky.

EXT. ODIN'S PALACE - DAY 27
27
27

Thor, Sif, Loki, and the Warriors Three walk from the 
Palace, across the grounds. They reach a group of ATTENDANTS 
who ready their battle gear for their journey. Loki slips 
away from the group, speaks to a nearby GUARD. Hogun 
notices.

THOR
We must first find a way to get 
past Heimdall.

VOLSTAGG
That will be no easy task. It's 
said the Gatekeeper can see a 
single dew drop fall from a blade 
of grass a thousand worlds away.

FANDRAL
And he can hear a cricket passing 
gas in Niffelheim.

VOLSTAGG
Jest not! He heareth all!

FANDRAL
Please. Getting past him should be 
simple enough now, since he seems 
to be letting Frost Giants sneak by 
under his nose.

Volstagg, terrified, calls out to the sky.

25.


VOLSTAGG
Forgive him! He meaneth no offense!

Loki rejoins the group as Thor leads them onward.

EXT. GATE OF ASGARD - DAY 28
28
28

Thor and his band of adventurers, on horseback, pass through 
the massive Gate, leaving Asgard behind. They ride along the 
most astounding path in this Realm or any other --

THE RAINBOW BRIDGE.

Wide and flat, it runs straight out from Odin's palace to 
the mists and black void of space beyond. In the distance 
far ahead, the Bridge continues on until it reaches 
Heimdall's Observatory.

EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 29
29
29

The band draws near the Observatory, where HEIMDALL himself, 
Gatekeeper of Asgard, stands at his post on the Bridge 
before them, blocking their way, staring them down. There is 
something other-worldly about him, even for this Realm. He 
holds a massive sword in front of him, his stern, 
intimidating face virtually concealed by armor. Something 
glints beneath his visor, like twinkling stars.

LOKI
Keep your weapons sheathed and your 
mouths closed. This is going to 
take subtlety and sincerity, not 
brute strength. Leave it to me. 
Loki dismounts and steps forward.

LOKI (CONT'D)
GOOD HEIMDALL--

HEIMDALL
You're not dressed warmly enough. 
Thor, Loki, and the others trade 
looks.

LOKI
I'm sorry?

HEIMDALL
The freezing cold of Jotunheim. It 
will kill you all in time, even 
Thor.

(THEN)
You think you can deceive me? I, 
who watch all? 
(MORE)

26.


I, who can sense the flapping of a 
butterfly's wings a thousand worlds 
away? He fixes his eyes pointedly 
at Fandral.

HEIMDALL
Or can hear a cricket passing gas 
in Niffelheim?

Fandral looks gob-smacked.

FANDRAL
That was just a bit of a jest, 
really...

Loki goes into damage control.

LOKI
You must be mistaken. We're not--

THOR
(STEPPING FORWARD)
Enough.

(TO HEIMDALL)
Heimdall, may we pass? Heimdall 
stares him down.

HEIMDALL
For ages have I guarded Asgard and 
kept it safe from those who would 
do it harm. In all that time, never 
has an enemy slipped by my watch -- 
until this day. I wish to know how 
that happened.

THOR
Then tell no one where we've gone 
until we've returned. Thor walks 
past Heimdall as the Gatekeeper 
lets the group pass. Volstagg walks 
beside the frustrated Loki, needles 
him.

VOLSTAGG
What happened? Your silver tongue 
turn to lead?

LOKI
Get me off this bridge before it 
cracks under your girth. Volstagg 
and Fandral share a laugh.

(THEN) (CONT'D)

27.


INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 30
30
30

Thor and the others enter the Observatory, step onto a 
platform. Heimdall climbs into the large control apparatus 
at the center of the room and readies the Observatory.

HEIMDALL
Be warned. I will honor my sworn 
oath to protect this Realm as its 
Gatekeeper. If your return 
threatens the safety of Asgard, 
Bifrost will remain closed to you. 
You'll be left to die in the cold 
wastes of Jotunheim.

THOR
I have no plans to die today.

HEIMDALL
None do.

Heimdall inserts his sword into the control panel, and the 
apparatus of the Observatory starts up.

EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE 31
31
31

The Bifrost energy quickens along the Bridge, feeding into 
the Observatory.

INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 32
32
32

Heimdall turns his sword in the control panel. The 
Observatory's giant turret swings around, aims toward a 
section of space. As a final step, Heimdall plunges his 
sword deeper into the control panel. The great turret FIRES, 
the RAINBOW LIGHT of Bifrost energy blasts out of it. The 
Bifrost opens at the end of the platform upon which Thor and 
his five comrades stand.

HEIMDALL
All is ready. You may pass.

VOLSTAGG
Couldn't you just leave the bridge 
open for us?

HEIMDALL
To keep this bridge open would 
unleash the full power of the 
Bifrost and destroy Jotunheim with 
you upon it.

28.


VOLSTAGG
Ah. Never mind, then. Thor starts 
towards the Bifrost, turns back to 
the others, grins.

THOR
Come on. Don't be bashful. The 
others join him at his side, then 
step towards the Bifrost. Their 
bodies stretch towards the 
maelstrom, changing shape, as if 
every atom of their being is being 
elongated by the pull of it. In an 
instant, they're jerked off the 
platform and inside the vortex.

EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 33
33
33

A hole in the sky rips open, and the Bifrost comes shooting 
out of it. Snow flurries up when the Bifrost hits, as Thor 
and his band touch down. RUNES from the Bifrost are 
imprinted on the ice around them.

Volstagg loses his footing, falling backwards. Thor quickly 
grabs him by the belt. We see the warrior dangling 
precariously on the edge of a sheer cliff on the planet's 
inner ring, opening up to the black abyss of space beyond.

THOR
Come on, big fella. Up...! With an 
effort, Thor pulls the burly 
warrior back onto the ice and, 
tremendously relieved, he 
proclaims:

VOLSTAGG
This belt! This belt is now my 
lucky belt! I will never remove it! 
Even when bathing!

FANDRAL
You bathe?

Thor and the others turn and stare out in horror and wonder 
at the frozen alien wasteland before them. The whole planet 
is a massive flattened ring of jagged ice, slowly breaking 
apart. Huge CHUNKS OF ICE calve away from its outer edges 
and float off into space. The planet's icy surface cracks 
and melts as far as the eye can see. The ruins of a Jotun 
city lies in the distance.

HOGUN
We shouldn't be here.

29.


THOR
Too late now.

FANDRAL
Actually, it's not. We could turn 
right around, hop back to Asgard, 
share a mug by the fire. Could be 
nice.

Thor ignore him, heads off. Loki looks around, anxious.

LOKI
Perhaps we should wait. Thor turns 
back to his brother.

THOR
For what?

LOKI
To survey the enemy. To gauge their 
strengths and weaknesses from a 
distance.

VOLSTAGG
I'm liking that. Gauging, 
surveying. Particularly the 
distance part.

THOR
We know all we must. It's time to 
act.

Thor heads on. Reluctantly, the others follow.

SIF
He's just got to swing his 
hammer...

EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 34
34
34

The group trudges behind Thor across the frozen wasteland, 
shielding themselves from the howling wind and cold. Loki 
looks around them, anxious. Volstagg shivers. Thor, 
invigorated, turns back to his comrades.

THOR
It feels good, doesn't it? To be 
together again, adventuring on 
another world?

FANDRAL
Adventuring? Is that what we're 
doing?

30.


THOR
What would you call it?

FANDRAL
Freezing.

VOLSTAGG
Starving.

SIF
Whining.

THOR
How about a song to lift our 
spirits?

The others groan.

HOGUN
No, not that!

SIF
Please don't make us sing again!

FANDRAL
If I have to listen to Volstagg's 
singing voice one more time, I'll 
fall on my own sword!

SIF
Well, now I'm on board. She and 
Thor share a grin. The party 
reaches the edge of the city -- its 
ancient structures of jade and ice 
melting and crumbling, ravaged by 
warfare long ago. A TEMPLE lies 
before them, across a central 
plaza.

SIF (CONT'D)
Where are they?

THOR
Hiding. As cowards always do. Thor 
leads the others onwards towards 
the central plaza. Loki reluctantly 
follows. They don't notice as 
SHADOWY FIGURES move in the shadows 
of the structures nearby.

EXT. CENTRAL PLAZA - DAY 35
35
35

The party reaches the plaza. They sense the Frost Giants in 
the shadows and crevices, surrounding them now on all sides. 

31.


The Asgardians reach for the hilts of their weapons. A JOTUN 
SENTRY calls to him.

JOTUN SENTRY
What is your business here, 
Asgardian?

The Jotun's voice itself sounds like cracking ice.

THOR
I speak only to your King. Not to 
his foot soldiers.

JOTUN VOICE (O.S.)
Then speak.

Thor turns towards the source in a balcony of the temple, 
where LAUFEY sits, veiled in shadow, behind a cascading 
waterfall. The Jotun King is ancient, noble, powerful -- too 
proud to reveal even a hint of the years of suffering he and 
his people have endured.

LAUFEY
I am Laufey, King of this Realm.

THOR
And I am--

LAUFEY
We know who you are, Odinson. Why 
have you brought the stench of your 
blood into my world?

THOR
I demand answers. Laufey stands, 
sizing up Thor, tries to piece this 
together.

LAUFEY
You "demand?"¬ù

THOR
How did your people get into 
Asgard?

LAUFEY
The house of Odin is full of 
traitors.

Sif and the Warriors Three exchange a puzzled look, 
disturbed by the Jotun King's words.

32.


THOR
Do not dishonor my father's name 
with your lies.

LAUFEY
Your father is a murderer and a 
thief. He stole what was ours, and 
left our world in ruins. We have 
the right to reclaim the Casket.

THOR
Not when you'd use it to make war 
against other Realms. Laufey 
laughs, cold, mocking.

LAUFEY
And why have you come here? To make 
peace? You long for battle. You 
crave it. I see you for what you 
are, Thor Odinson. Nothing but a 
boy, trying to prove himself a man.

THOR
This boy has grown tired of your 
mockery.

Thor takes a step towards Laufey. The other Jotuns step in 
front of Thor, blocking his path. We finally see the Frost 
Giants now -- terrifying, blue-skinned, standing eight feet 
tall. Loki moves next to his brother and quietly implores 
him.

LOKI
Thor, stop and think. Look around 
you. We are outnumbered.

THOR
Know your place, brother...

LAUFEY
You should listen to his counsel. 
You know not what your actions 
would unleash.

Laufey steps out of the shadows.

LAUFEY (CONT'D)
But I do. Go now, while I still 
allow it.

Thor simmers. Loki speaks up.

33.


LOKI
We will accept your most gracious 
offer.

The others look to Thor imploringly. Thor stares Laufey down 
a beat -- then relents. He turns to leave. His comrades 
breathe a sigh of relief and follow, when a Frost Giant 
nearby mutters under his breath.

JOTUN
Run back home, little princess. 
Thor stops in his tracks. Loki goes 
white. He knows what's coming.

LOKI
Damn.

In one quick move, Thor pulls Mjolnir, swings it, and KNOCKS 
the Jotun clear across the plaza. The Asgardians reluctantly 
draw their weapons, gather into a circle around Thor. 
Volstagg looks around at the angry Jotuns approaching them.

VOLSTAGG
Silly hammer! Has a mind of its 
own!

ICE forms on the Jotuns' bodies, creating a FROZEN ARMOR 
around them, extending off the ends of their arms like 
SWORDS. One Giant does so directly in front of Fandral.

FANDRAL
I'm hoping that's just decorative. 
Thor leaves the circle of 
Asgardians, swings at another Frost 
Giant. His comrades form another 
circle around him, separating him 
from the Jotuns, as he whirls his 
hammer around once and catches it 
with a cocky grin. He's enjoying 
this.

THOR
Next!

Fandral calls to Volstagg and Hogun.

FANDRAL
Well? What move, do you think?

VOLSTAGG
I say we use "The Norn's 
Revenge."¬ù

34.


FANDRAL
At this close range? I think "The 
Alfheim Lunge"¬ù is a better move.

VOLSTAGG
(DISGUSTED)
Maybe if they were three feet tall! 
No! How about "The Randy 
Valkyrie"¬ù?

HOGUN
Shut up!

Thor takes out yet another Frost Giant, then all hell breaks 
loose as the Asgardians and Jotuns begin to battle. A Jotun 
backs Hogun up against a wall of ice. As the Giant hurls an 
ice blade fist at him, the grim warrior swings his mace over 
his head, embedding it into the ice wall, and hoists himself 
up, dodging the Giant's blow and leaping over him. Hogun 
takes out a second approaching Frost Giant, spins back, 
dodges a swing from the first, then pounds the Jotun with 
his mace. Nearby, Sif expertly stabs one Jotun after another 
with her double-bladed staff. One knocks her viciously to 
the ground.

SIF
If you don't treat me like a lady, 
I won't act like a lady! She takes 
out the Jotun. Loki backs away from 
an approaching Jotun, finds himself 
at the edge of a deep crevasse. The 
Giant sees he's vulnerable, swipes 
at him. But the Jotun's arm passes 
right through him. The Giant stands 
there, confused, when THE REAL LOKI 
comes out from behind a structure 
and shoves the Giant into the 
crevasse below. The false Loki 
dissipates into nothingness.

LOKI
(to the falling Giant)
Pathetic.

He turns back to the battle. Two Jotuns come at him from 
either side. He lets two daggers fly, felling both Giants at 
once. Laufey nods to one of his guards -- a massive Jotun 
BRUTE. The Brute leaps down from the balcony, icing himself 
up, then punches his giant fist into the ice beneath his 
feet. It's a long-range attack, causing PILLARS OF ICE to 
explode out in front of Hogun, sending the grim warrior 
flying back. Across the plaza, Thor easily dispatches some 
Jotuns.

35.


THOR
Come on! At least make it a 
challenge for me! He sees the Brute 
coming at him. The huge Jotun lands 
a tremendous blow, sending Thor 
back across the ice. Thor rises, 
grins.

THOR (CONT'D)
Now that's more like it! He throws 
Mjolnir with all his strength, 
knocking the Brute head over heels. 
Thor raises his hand. Mjolnir slows 
in mid-air, then flies back to his 
grasp.

THOR (CONT'D)
(re: the fallen Brute)
Ugly and stupid. Sif takes out a 
couple Frost Giants, but she's 
knocked to the ground by another. 
It raises its weapon above her. 
Hogun sees Sif in danger. He pulls 
a HIDDEN KNIFE from his sleeve and 
hurls it at Sif's attacker, hitting 
him square in the chest. The Jotun 
falls dead.

SIF
(to Hogun, re: knife)
I'm so glad I taught him how to do 
that!

Volstagg grapples with a Frost Giant, getting a couple good 
hits in.

VOLSTAGG
You may want to put some ice on 
that!

The Frost Giant fights back, but Volstagg manages to grip in 
a headlock just as another comes up on him from behind. 
Volstagg fends him off, then turns the first one loose.

VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
You may be taller, but I'm wider! 
Volstagg launches his mighty belly 
at the Jotun and sends him flying.

Another Jotun grabs Volstagg, squeezing him tightly and 
sending him crashing to the ground.

36.


VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
It's not too late for you to 
surrender.

Volstagg recovers and fights on. The Jotun grabs Volstagg's 
bare arm. The warrior's skin begins to freeze from the 
Jotun's grasp, a BLACKNESS spreading from it, necrotizing 
Volstagg's flesh. The warrior SHOUTS in pain.

Volstagg head-butts the Frost Giant, shattering the Jotun's 
ice helmet and dropping him to the ground. Winded, he takes 
a seat upon one of the fallen Jotun's bodies to catch his 
breath. As the battle rages around him, he opens a secret 
compartment at the end of his weapon, takes out a small 
FLASK. Volstagg grimaces in pain, sees his blackened skin. 
He yells to his comrades.

VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Don't let them grab hold of you! He 
takes a swig, enjoying the brief 
respite, then rejoins the battle.

Volstagg stabs his blade in a Giant's chest, but the sword 
stops mid ice layer. The Giant delivers a bone-breaking blow 
to Volstagg's face, and the warrior drops to one knee. Sif 
sees Volstagg in trouble and rushes towards him. In one 
quick move, she leaps up and off of Volstagg's back, using 
her boot to plunge Volstagg's blade deep into the Giant's 
chest, standing atop him as he falls backwards to the 
ground.

VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
(on his belly)
Thank you, my lady. But I nearly 
had him!

SIF
Of course you did. Nearby, a Frost 
Giant forms a BARRAGE OF ICE 
BULLETS, hurling them at Sif. Sif 
raises her shield barely in time, 
as the bullets go pinging and 
ricocheting off it. She races into 
the group of Frost Giants who 
attacked her and takes them out.

A Frost Giant touches a pool of standing water. It FLASH- 
FREEZES Hogun's feet to the ground. Volstagg notices, 
hurries over, dispatching Jotuns as he goes.

VOLSTAGG
Hang on!

37.


Volstagg swings his weapon, wildly hacking at the ice around 
Hogun's legs to free him. Hogun looks down, suddenly 
worried, as Volstagg's blade cuts deep -- and perilously 
close to hacking into Hogun's legs.

HOGUN
Watch the legs!

VOLSTAGG
(REALIZING)
Right. Sorry.

Volstagg chips away at the ice more carefully, finally 
freeing Hogun's feet. Fandral sword fights with a Frost 
Giant.

FANDRAL
You really think your icicles are a 
match for Asgardian steel? Fandral 
lunges at the Giant. The Jotun 
knocks his blade away.

FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Fair enough.

Fandral moves on him again, but the Giant grabs Fandral's 
sword and snaps it in half.

FANDRAL (CONT'D)
Could we stop just a moment while I 
get another sword? Fandral fights 
the Giant with his broken sword. 
The Jotun then lunges at Fandral, 
who ducks just in time, grabs hold 
of the Giant's sword and redirects 
it, stabbing the Giant through with 
his own weapon. The Jotun staggers 
back, then reaches down and swipes 
at a pool of water, sending up a 
spray that freezes in mid-air, 
forming into an ICE STALAGMITE. It 
impales Fandral, rendering him 
helpless.

Loki races towards the impaled Fandral, throwing daggers and 
felling Frost Giants as he goes. He reaches the nearly- 
unconscious warrior, when other Jotuns approach. He fights 
them off. Volstagg looks across the plaza and sees the 
impaled Fandral.

VOLSTAGG
That's unfortunate. He hurries to 
his wounded comrade.

38.


FANDRAL
I may need a bit of help. Not a 
good look, is it?

VOLSTAGG
Just try not to bleed.

FANDRAL
How's the face?

VOLSTAGG
Flawless.

Volstagg begins to pull the bleeding Fandral off the ice 
stalagmite. Loki plunges two daggers into the chest of one 
of the Frost Giants. The Giant grabs hold of Loki's gloved 
wrists. Loki pulls his hands free of the gloves, which are 
still in the Giant's grasp, revealing Loki's skin beneath. 
The wounded Jotun sees his chance, grabs hold of Loki's bare 
arm. Loki looks at his arm, prepared for the worst. But 
instead of the blackness of necrotizing flesh, Loki's arm 
turns BLUE -- like the Frost Giant's own skin. The blueness 
spreads painlessly up Loki's arm. He stares at it, confused. 
The Frost Giant is thrown as well, distracted by the 
unexpected phenomenon. Loki takes advantage of the 
distraction, KICKS the Giant.

Thor continues fighting, his blood lust rising. He taunts 
the Jotuns around him.

THOR
Come on!

But when he hurls his hammer to take out a Jotun, the Frost 
Giants seize the opportunity. A group of Jotuns swarm Thor 
from all sides, keeping him separate from his weapon. 
Mjolnir falls to the ground. A Frost Giant desperately 
struggles to lift Mjolnir off the ground, to no avail. Now 
free, the wounded Fandral looks relieved as Volstagg slings 
him over his shoulder, and the warriors start to leave. From 
his balcony, Laufey looks upon the battlefield, decides it's 
time to pull out the big guns. He touches a wall of the 
palace. An ENERGY WAVE sweeps from his touch, across the 
wall of the palace, and down to the ground below. The 
Asgardians hear a foreboding CRACK OF ICE below their feet.

LOKI
That can't be good.

VOLSTAGG
Yes, it could! Might be an early 
spring!

39.


They look down, suddenly filled with dread when they see 
shadowy figures moving in the ice -- dozens of JOTUN 
WARRIORS awakening beneath the surface, rousing to join the 
battle. Loki turns to his brother, who battles a group of 
the Giants.

LOKI
Thor, we must go! Thor, still 
without his hammer, fights his 
Jotun foes mercilessly, a man 
consumed by blood lust. Loki sees 
the look on his brother's face -- 
the savage thrill of the heat of 
battle.

THOR
Then go!

SIF
There are too many of them!

THOR
I can stop them! The others 
hesitate. Jotuns break up through 
the ice all around them.

SIF
Thor!

But Thor ignores his comrades, continues fighting.

VOLSTAGG
Run!

Reluctantly, the group flees back toward the inner edge of 
the planet as the Giants break up through the ice and give 
chase. Thor battles valiantly, but there's just too many of 
them. The Frost Giants swarm him from all sides now, as he 
disappears beneath a pile of blue flesh and ice. After a

MOMENT --

THOR'S FIST
Forces its way up through the 
middle of the pile of Jotuns. He 
opens his hand, beckoning. One of 
Thor's attackers hears something 
ROARING up behind him. He whirls 
around -- BAM! -- Mjolnir nails him 
square in the face, then flies into 
Thor's outstretched hand. Thor 
raises the hammer up high, and 
brings it down on the ground with 
all his might. KRAKABOOM! 
(MORE)

40.


Lightning strikes down from the 
sky, the hammer channeling the 
blast, firing the electricity out 
at the Jotuns around him. They're 
blasted back in a massive 
shockwave. The Jotuns convulse, 
drop dead to the ground.

But the force of the blast also cracks the ice below, the 
shockwave continuing to spread outwards. It moves out to 
where his comrades are running, breaking up the ground 
beneath them, exposing the black void of space below.

VOLSTAGG
What's Thor done?

LOKI
Likely killed us all! As the Jotuns 
race towards the Asgardians, they 
open their mouths wide and breathe 
out an ICY FOG. The swirling mists 
quickly engulf the fleeing 
Asgardians before them. The 
Asgardians stand in the mist, 
unable to see. Hogun takes a step 
back, the ice cracking beneath him. 
They dare not move, for fear of 
falling through, into the void 
below. Thor sees he's put his 
friends in even greater danger. He 
raises Mjolnir high, SUMMONING THE 
WINDS. They lift him off the ground 
and carry him across the frozen 
wasteland to his comrades.

EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (JOTUNHEIM) - DAY 35A

Thor lands beside his comrades in the shroud of mists.

THOR
Loki, we have to see. Loki raises 
his arms, concentrates, the mists 
dissipating. But as they do, the 
Asgardians see before them the 
faces of the Frost Giants. And 
there are HUNDREDS of them -- too 
many, even for a Thunder God.

VOLSTAGG
(TO LOKI)
Actually, could you bring the mists 
back, please?

THOR'S FIST (CONT'D)

41.


Thor realizes that he and his comrades are as good as dead. 
The Giants move in for the kill, when they hear a deafening 
ROAR. A hole in the sky opens up, and the Bifrost blasts 
down onto the inner edge of the planet. Out of the maelstrom 
comes the sound of THUNDERING HOOVES, and, to the shock of 
all, tearing across the frozen wasteland comes --

ODIN ALLFATHER
Astride his powerful, eight-legged 
steed SLEIPNIR. He's clad in battle 
armor, Gungnir in his hand -- an 
imposing sight.

The Giants part in fear as he thunders into their ranks, 
stopping before Laufey and the Asgardians. Laufey slams his 
fists into the ground, and the ice beneath his feet raises 
him towards Odin. The Asgardians start to react, thinking 
it's an attack, but Laufey just stands face- to-face with 
Odin. Asgardian and Jotun alike look on uneasily, unsure 
what's about to happen. Laufey sizes up Odin, notices that 
as powerful as the Allfather still is, the years have taken 
their toll. He's not the foe he once was. The two rulers 
talk quietly, out of earshot of the others.

ODIN
Laufey. End this.

LAUFEY
Your boy sought this out.

ODIN
You're right. These are the actions 
of a boy. Treat them as such. You 
and I can stop this before there's 
further bloodshed. Unseen by Odin 
and the others, Laufey starts to 
form an ice blade at the end of his 
arm.

LAUFEY
We are beyond diplomacy now, 
Allfather. He'll get what he came 
for -- war and death. Odin looks 
grim, determined.

ODIN
So be it.

Without warning, Laufey swings his ice blade at Odin, but 
Odin is quicker. The Allfather brings his spear down upon 
the ice. Laufey and the nearest Jotuns go falling backwards 
in a wave, the ice cracking beneath their feet. The other 
Frost Giants turn tail and run. Thor watches the fleeing 
Jotuns with delight.

42.


THOR
Now! We'll finish them together!

ODIN
Silence!

Odin raises his spear. The hole in the sky opens, the 
Bifrost energy blasting forth from it. The Bifrost envelops 
the Asgardians, yanks them off the ground and up through the 
hole. The vortex closes behind them as all falls silent. 
Laufey stares up after them contemptuously.

INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 36

Heimdall stands at the Observatory controls. Odin pulls 
Heimdall's sword from the control panel and throws it to 
him. Heimdall backs away.

THOR
Why did you bring us back?

ODIN
Do you realize what you've done? 
What you've started?

THOR
I was protecting my home.

ODIN
You cannot protect your friends. 
How can you hope to protect a 
kingdom?

Odin turns to the others.

ODIN (CONT'D)
(RE: FANDRAL)
Get him to the healing room! Sif, 
Volstagg, and Hogun hurry to help 
Fandral out of the room.

THOR
There won't be a kingdom to protect 
if you're afraid to act! Odin 
stares at him.

THOR (CONT'D)
Whatever the cost, the world must 
know that the new King of Asgard 
will not be held in contempt.

ODIN
That's pride and vanity that talks! 
Not leadership! 
(MORE)

43.


Have you forgotten everything I've 
taught you? What of a warrior's 
patience, cunning?

THOR
While you wait and be patient, the 
Nine Realms laugh at us! The old 
ways are done. You'd stand giving 
speeches while Asgard falls!

ODIN
You're a vain, greedy, cruel boy!

THOR
And you are an old man and a fool! 
The whole world seems to stop at 
Thor's words. Odin falls quiet. 
When he speaks again, there's 
something terrifying beneath the 
calmness of his words.

ODIN
A fool, yes! I was a fool to think 
you were ready.

Loki takes a step towards Odin imploringly.

LOKI
FATHER--

Odin turns and gives Loki a look which stops him in his 
tracks.

ODIN
Thor Odinson... You have disobeyed 
the express command of your King. 
Through your arrogance and 
stupidity, you have opened these 
peaceful Realms and innocent lives 
to the horrors of war. The 
Allfather plunges Gungnir into 
Observatory's control panel. The 
turret turns, the Bifrost energy 
building along with Odin's rage. It 
FIRES, as the Bifrost opens at the 
end of the platform, creating a 
portal behind Thor. Odin turns 
angrily to his son.

ODIN (CONT'D)
You are unworthy of this Realm... 
Odin RIPS a disc off Thor's chest.

ODIN (CONT'D)

44.


ODIN (CONT'D)
...unworthy of your title... He 
rips away Thor's cloak.

ODIN (CONT'D)
...unworthy of the loved ones 
you've betrayed. I hereby take from 
you your powers. Odin extends his 
hand towards his son. Mjolnir goes 
flying from Thor's grasp into 
Odin's hand.

ODIN (CONT'D)
In the name of my father... A 
FINGER OF LIGHTNING comes off the 
hammer and hits Thor, 
disintegrating the right arm of his 
armor and part of the chest piece.

ODIN (CONT'D)
...and of his father before... 
Another strike disintegrates the 
remainder of Thor's armor, 
including the cape and torn-away 
disc on the floor.

ODIN (CONT'D)
I cast you out!

Odin thrusts Mjolnir before him and -- with a CRACK OF 
THUNDER -- Thor is hurled backwards into the open Bifrost 
and disappears in the vortex.

Odin holds Mjolnir in his hand, stares at it bitterly. He 
closes his eyes, lost in contemplation, whispers something 
quietly.

ODIN (CONT'D)
(WHISPERING)
Whosoever holds this hammer, if he 
be worthy, shall possess the power 
of Thor.

RUNES appear on the side of the hammer, as if carved into 
its smooth surface. The runes linger for but a moment, then 
disappear. Suddenly, Odin turns and hurls the hammer into 
the Bifrost.

CUT TO BLACK.

EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - NIGHT 37

Thor opens his eyes, surrounded by darkness. Suddenly, he's 
blinded by bright headlights of a vehicle -- an SUV. 

45.


It swerves, the side of it coming straight at him. It SLAMS 
into him, as we:

CUT TO BLACK.

After a beat, we hear familiar voices.

DARCY (V.O.)
I think that was legally your 
fault.

JANE (V.O.)
Get the first aid kit.

(THEN)
Come on, big guy. Do me a favor and 
don't be dead, okay? Open your eyes 
and look at me.

THOR'S POV
Thor opens his eyes to see Jane 
Foster staring at him, concerned. 
She looks vulnerable and beautiful.

DARCY (O.S.)
Wow. Does he need CPR? Because I 
know CPR.

END THOR'S POV

TIME CUT TO:

Jane regretfully watches the storm EVAPORATE above their 
heads. A thought strikes her.

JANE
(TO SELVIG)
Where did he come from? They 
exchange puzzled looks when Thor 
GROANS again. He sits up abruptly, 
and Jane topples backwards in 
surprise. Thor staggers groggily to 
his feet, then turns and offers 
Jane a hand up. She takes it 
hesitantly, and he easily pulls her 
up. She can't help but marvel at 
his strength.

JANE (CONT'D)
Uh, thanks. Are you okay? Thor 
searches the ground.

THOR
Hammer...

46.


DARCY
Yeah, we can tell you're hammered. 
That's pretty obvious. Jane notices 
something on the ground around 
them. She shines her flashlight 
down at the sand.

JANE
Erik... look at this. He joins her 
at her side and sees it. A faint, 
discernible pattern is etched into 
the sand. They exchange a look. 
Amazed and excited, Jane hurriedly 
takes out a camera and snaps some 
photos of the runes. A breeze 
begins to blow them away.

JANE (CONT'D)
We've got to move fast before 
anything changes.

JANE (CONT'D)
We need soil samples, light 
readings, everything. She pulls out 
a light meter, holds it up, takes 
some readings, jots them down in 
her notebook. Selvig looks at Thor, 
who stares up at the sky.

SELVIG
Jane, we need get him to a 
hospital.

Jane kneels and quickly scoops up a soil sample in the 
cannister.

JANE
Not right now. It'll take too long. 
County's an hour away. We'll drop 
him off after we're done here.

Selvig looks uncertain.

JANE (CONT'D)
(RE: THOR)
Look at him, he's fine. Thor stares 
up at the stars, shouts up at them 
angrily.

THOR
Father! Heimdall! I know you can 
hear me! Open the bridge!

47.


JANE
(off Selvig's look)
Okay, you and Darcy take him to the 
hospital, I'll stay here.

SELVIG
You expect me to leave you alone in 
the middle of the desert? Thor 
turns to the others, frustrated.

THOR
You! What world is this? The group 
is intimidated by his fervor.

SELVIG
It's all right, my friend. We're 
going to get you some help. Selvig 
touches Thor's shoulder. Thor 
shoves him off, grows agitated, 
belligerent.

THOR
Where am I?! Answer me! Darcy 
reaches into her fanny pack, pulls 
something out of it. Jane looks on, 
concerned.

JANE
Erik, just back away...

SELVIG
(to Thor, calming)
You're in the desert outside the 
town of Puente Antiguo.

THOR
What Realm?! Alfheim? Nornheim?

DARCY
Uh... New Mexico? Darcy raises a 
TASER at him. Thor looks at the 
weapon, unsure what to make of it.

THOR
You dare threaten Thor with so puny

A--
Darcy fires, the electrified wires 
shooting out of the taser, ZAPPING 
him in the chest. Thor convulses, 
falls to the ground unconscious. 
Jane and Selvig stare at her, 
shocked.

48.


DARCY
What? He was freaking me out.

EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - MOMENTS LATER 38

As Jane still takes soil samples, Darcy and Selvig struggle 
to drag an unconscious Thor to the SUV and lift him inside.

SELVIG
(TO DARCY)
Next time you decide to taser 
someone, do me a favor and make 
sure they're already inside the 
truck.

(TO JANE)
Jane, come on... Reluctantly, Jane 
joins the others inside the SUV.

EXT. DESERT - MOMENTS LATER 39

The SUV heads off into the distance. Behind it, high 
overhead, a HOLE opens in the sky. A last blast of Bifrost 
energy bursts forth from it, and a small OBJECT comes firing 
into our world. It BURNS across the desert sky like a 
meteor.

Selvig watches the unconscious Thor with interest as two 
ORDERLIES set the Asgardian onto a gurney. Jane and Darcy 
stand before a sweet, ditzy ADMISSIONS NURSE.

ADMISSIONS NURSE
Name?

JANE
He said it was "Thor."¬ù The Nurse 
painstakingly types it into the 
computer, one key at a time. Jane 
watches as Thor is wheeled out of 
the room.

ADMISSIONS NURSE
(SPELLING)
T-H-O-R. And your relationship to 
him?

49.


JANE
I've never met him before.

DARCY
Until she hit him with the car.

JANE
Grazed him, actually.

(THEN)
Oh, and we tasered him, too.

ADMISSIONS NURSE
(SYMPATHETIC)
Must have been quite the spat.

JANE
I told you, I don't know him. I 
just want to make sure he's okay.

ADMISSIONS NURSE
I'm going to need a name and 
contact number.

JANE
Jane Foster.

ADMISSIONS NURSE
(TYPING SLOWLY)

J...A...N...

SELVIG
Oh, for God's sake... He reaches 
over Jane's shoulder and hands the 
Nurse his business card.

SELVIG (CONT'D)
Here. Let's go.

Selvig, Darcy, and Jane head out.

INT. HOSPITAL ER - NIGHT 43

Thor, now in a hospital gown, winces in pain as he awakens 
on a gurney to find a NURSE standing over him, a syringe in 
his arm.

NURSE
Hi. Just taking a little blood. 
Thor SLAPS the syringe away 
angrily, starts to sit up.

50.


THOR
How dare you attack the son of 
Odin!

NURSE
I need some help! Two ORDERLIES 
race over, try to hold Thor down.

NURSE (CONT'D)
We're trying to help you!

THOR
Then bring me a healing stone, you 
savages!

He hurls one of them off, smashing against a wall. Now a 
couple SECURITY GUARDS and MALE NURSES join the fracas, all 
struggling to hold Thor down. Medical equipment goes flying, 
furniture overturned.

ORDERLY
What the hell is this guy on? 
Finally, they force him back down 
onto the gurney. Thor looks shocked 
and amazed that he's actually being 
overpowered by this small group. 
The NURSE injects him with a 
sedative.

THOR
You're no match for the Mighty-- 
Thor struggles a beat, then passes 
out.

Smoke rises from a fifty foot wide CRATER. A TOWNIE pulls 
his pick-up to a stop at the crater's edge. He climbs out, 
peers down below, his curiosity piqued by what he sees.

TOWNIE
Huh.

The Townie approaches something at the center of the crater. 
We don't see what it is, but it bathes him in an 
otherworldly, BLUE LUMINOUS GLOW. He reaches for the object, 
tries to lift it, but can't. He redoubles his efforts, 
strains with all his might, with no luck. He takes off his 
hat, fans himself, stares at the mysterious object.

TOWNIE (CONT'D)
Huh.

EXT./INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - MORNING 45

The distant mountains glint snow in the early morning light. 
Selvig appears with a cup of coffee and surveys the vast 
desert. He turns back into the lab and sees Jane, busy at 
her workstation, soldering a piece of equipment. A printer 
churns out blown-up screen-cap PHOTOS of the Bifrost 
footage. Darcy hangs them on the wall. Selvig surveys the 
scene, watches how Jane works, impressed. He notices a 
monitor which displays a complex program entitled "J. FOSTER 
ALGORITHM ANALYSIS"¬ù. He looks proud. The three of them 
have been up all night, fueled by caffeine and excitement.

JANE
Darcy, when you're done, take the 
soil samples to Professor Meyers in 
geology. Remind him, he owes me.

SELVIG
We might want to perform a spectral 
analysis.

JANE
"We?"¬ù

SELVIG
I flew all the way out here -- 
might as well make myself useful. 
This is the offer Jane's been 
waiting for. She gets up, inserts 
the piece of equipment she's been 
working on into a rack-mounted 
server.

JANE
You know what would be really 
useful? Do you still have that 
friend at LIGO?

SELVIG
She was more than a friend.

JANE
Could you call in a favor?

SELVIG
You don't think this was just a 
magnetic storm?

JANE
If I'm right, their observatory 
must have picked up gravitational 
waves during last night's event.

52.


SELVIG
Meaning?

Jane heads over to a computer monitor. Selvig follows.

JANE
Meaning these anomalies might 
signify something bigger.

SELVIG
How "big"¬ù are we talking about? 
Jane indicates the footage on the 
monitor. As the last of the Bifrost 
cloud disappears into the night 
sky, there appears to be a blister 
in space, bulging out in convex and 
covered with stars.

JANE
I think the lensing around the 
edges is characteristic of an 
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

DARCY
A what?

SELVIG
I thought you were a science major.

DARCY
Political Science. Selvig shoots 
Jane a confused look. Jane shrugs.

JANE
She was the only applicant.

SELVIG
(TO DARCY)
An Einstein-Rosen Bridge -- a 
"theoretical"¬ù connection between 
two different points of space-time. 
Darcy stares blankly.

JANE
(TO DARCY)
A wormhole.

Selvig looks skeptical. Jane prints out a frame-grab off the 
monitor.

JANE (CONT'D)
Erik, look...

53.


Jane indicates the print-out showing the constellations seen 
through the "bubble"¬ù in the clouds.

JANE (CONT'D)
What do you see here?

SELVIG
Stars.

JANE
Yes. But not our stars. She spreads 
out a STAR CHART, barely able to 
contain her excitement.

JANE (CONT'D)
This is the star alignment for our 
quadrant, this time of year. So 
unless Ursa Minor decided to take 
the day off... those are someone 
else's constellations. Selvig's 
intrigued, in spite of himself. 
Darcy pulls another frame-grab of 
the Bifrost footage from the 
printer and hangs it on the wall, 
when something in the image catches 
her eye.

DARCY
Hey, check it out. Jane and Selvig 
examine the photo, amazed.

SELVIG
Is that...?

JANE
I think I left something at the 
hospital.

As Jane walks away, we REVEAL the photo. Inside the Bifrost 
funnel cloud is a FIGURE -- the vague, but unmistakable 
shape of a MAN.

ODIN
Do you understand what he set in 
motion? He's taken us to the brink 
of war!

FRIGGA
But banishment? You would lose him 
forever? He's your son!

ODIN
What would you have done?

FRIGGA
I would not have exiled him to a 
world of mortals, stripped of his 
powers, to suffer alone. I would 
not have had the heart for such 
cruelty!

ODIN
That is why I'm King.

(THEN)
I, too, grieve the loss of our son. 
But there are some things that even 
I cannot undo.

FRIGGA
You can bring him back.

ODIN
No. His fate is in his own hands 
now.

Thor awakens on a hospital bed. He notices RESTRAINTS on his

his hands slips free from its 
restraint.

But... I'm his wife. Darcy stifles 
a SNICKER at this, as the Nurse 
looks doubtful.

ADMISSIONS NURSE
I thought you said you didn't know 
him.

JANE
I meant I barely know him anymore. 
The man he's become. He's changed. 
I mean, what woman really knows her 
husband, anyway?

None of us, dear. He's in Room

We find him.

SELVIG
Did you see what he did in there? I 
don't know if finding him is the 
best idea.

56.


JANE
I want to know what that thing was, 
and he may have the answers. We 
don't have a choice.

DARCY
Oo-kay.

She pulls out her taser and a can of mace.

SELVIG
So we're just going to spend the 
rest of the day looking for him?

JANE
However long it takes. Jane puts 
the car in reverse and backs up, 
when --

She collides with Thor again, dressed in stolen hospital 
scrubs. Jane and Selvig exchange a look.

I'm so sorry. I swear I'm not doing 
that on purpose.

Thor looks up at the sky.

THOR
Blue sky... one sun... This is 
Earth, isn't it?

DARCY
I think you may have hit him with 
the car one time too many.

JANE
(TO THOR)
Let's get you some clothes.

INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 53
53
53

Sif, Loki, and the Warriors three, battered and shell- 
shocked, still reeling from the day's events, sit before a 
ROARING central fire. Hogun reaches into the flames, pulls 
out some fragile HEALING STONES. Neither the fire, nor the 
stones burn him. As he carefully places the stones over the 
wounds of his comrades, the stones begin to glow. 

57.


He crushes them to a powder. His comrades' injuries heal up 
at the glowing powder's touch. Fandral winces in pain as 
Hogun heals his gaping wound. Volstagg looks at the skin on 
his arm -- healing, but still blackened from the necrotizing 
touch of the Frost Giant. Loki watches him, then stares at 
his own arm, where the Giant's touch turned his skin blue. 
It's undamaged, back to its normal color.

VOLSTAGG
We should never have let him go.

SIF
There was no stopping him.

FANDRAL
At least he's only banished, not 
dead. Which is what we'd all be if 
that guard hadn't told Odin where 
we'd gone.

VOLSTAGG
How did the guard even know? Loki 
stares at his arm.

LOKI
I told him.

FANDRAL
What?

LOKI
I told him to go to Odin after we'd 
left. Though he should be flogged 
for taking so long.

VOLSTAGG
You told the guard?

LOKI
I saved our lives! And Thor's. I 
had no idea Father would banish him 
for what he did.

SIF
Loki, you're the only one who can 
help Thor now. You must go to the 
Allfather and convince him to 
change his mind!

LOKI
And if I do, then what? I love Thor 
more dearly than any of you, but 
you know what he is. He's arrogant. 
He's reckless. He's dangerous. 
(MORE)

58.


You saw how he was today. Is that 
what Asgard needs from its King?

The others exchange glances, torn. Loki has a point. He 
leaves the room. Hogun stares after him.

SIF
He may speak about the good of 
Asgard, but he's always been 
jealous of Thor.

VOLSTAGG
True, but we should be grateful to 
him. He did save our lives.

HOGUN
Laufey said there were traitors in 
the House of Odin. The others turn 
to the usually quiet Hogun.

FANDRAL
Why is it every time you choose to 
speak, it has to be something dark 
and ominous?

HOGUN
A master of magic could easily 
bring three Jotuns into Asgard. The 
others look to Hogun, understanding 
the implication.

VOLSTAGG
No! Surely not!

FANDRAL
Loki's always been one for 
mischief, but you're talking about 
something else entirely.

SIF
Who else could elude Heimdall's 
gaze with tricks of light and 
shadow?

VOLSTAGG
The ceremony was interrupted just 
before Thor was named King.

SIF
We should go to the Allfather.

LOKI (CONT'D)

59.


FANDRAL
And tell him what? "Oh, by the way, 
we think your son just betrayed the 
throne. And do us a favor. Bring 
back Thor. There's a good 
fellow!"¬ù

SIF
It's our duty. If any of our 
suspicions are right, then all of 
Asgard is in danger.

INT. VAULT - DAY 54
54
54

Loki heads into the Vault, sees the Casket of Ancient 
Winters sitting on its stand. He walks over to it slowly, 
reaches out to it, lifts it between his forearms off its 
pedestal. As he does, a blueness spreads from his arms, 
across his body. The latticework behind the Casket starts to 
separate, the Destroyer rousing. A fire starts to glow 
within its black metal armor, as it rattles to life, but 
Loki ignores it -- the blueness spreading further, consuming 
his whole body.

ODIN (O.S.)
Stop!

Loki turns, sees Odin hurrying into the room, the Destroyer 
goes motionless, the latticework rejoining before it. Odin 
eyes Loki with dismay.

LOKI
Am I cursed?

ODIN
No. Put the Casket down. Loki sets 
the Casket back upon its pedestal, 
his body quickly returning to its 
normal form and color. He stares at 
his father.

LOKI
What am I?

ODIN
You're my son.

LOKI
What more than that? Odin doesn't 
answer. He looks suddenly weary, 
burdened. Loki sizes him up, 
realizes the truth.

60.


LOKI (CONT'D)
The Casket wasn't the only thing 
you took from Jotunheim that day, 
was it?

Odin looks him in the eye. He can deny it no longer.

ODIN
No.

(BEAT)
In the aftermath of the battle, I 
went into the Temple, and I found a 
baby. Small for a giant's offspring 
-- abandoned, suffering, left to 
die. Laufey's son. Loki is sent 
reeling by the revelation.

LOKI
Laufey's son...

He desperately struggles to make sense of it all.

LOKI (CONT'D)
Why? You were knee-deep in Jotun 
blood. Why would you take me?

ODIN
You were an innocent child.

LOKI
You took me for a purpose, what was 
it?

Odin doesn't answer.

LOKI (CONT'D)
Tell me!

ODIN
I thought we could unite our 
kingdoms one day, bring about an 
alliance, bring about a permanent 
peace... through you. But those 
plans no longer matter.

LOKI
So I am no more than another stolen 
relic, locked up here until you 
might have use of me.

ODIN
Why do you twist my words?

61.


LOKI
You could have told me what I was 
from the beginning. Why didn't you?

ODIN
You are my son. My blood. I wanted 
only to protect you from the truth.

LOKI
Because I am the monster parents 
tell their children about at night?

ODIN
Don't...

LOKI
It all makes sense now. Why you 
favored Thor all these years.

ODIN
Listen...

LOKI
Because no matter how much you 
claim to "love"¬ù me, you could 
never have a Frost Giant sitting on 
the Throne of Asgard! Odin's body 
begins to shake, he lifts his hand. 
It starts to move out of synch 
temporarily, leaving a trail, the 
effect of the Odinsleep 
approaching. Loki doesn't notice as 
Odin tries to fight it off.

ODIN
Listen to me!

Loki strides away towards the exit.

ODIN (CONT'D)
Loki!

Odin starts towards him, when the enormous mental, 
emotional, and physical strain of recent events finally 
takes its toll. The effect of the Odinsleep consumes him. 
His entire body now moves out of sync with the rest of the 
world, leaving trails behind him as he staggers backwards. 
Odin falls back against a wall, his face contorting in a 
scream. He collapses to the stone floor. Loki, shocked, 
hurries to him. He takes Odin in his arms, calls out.

LOKI
Guards!

EXT. OUTSIDE OF CRATER - DAY 58

Cars, pick-ups, and SUVs are parked around the crater, the 
sound of a BOISTEROUS PARTY coming from within.

EXT. INSIDE OF CRATER 59
59
59

It looks like the whole town has turned out. LOCALS sit on 
lounge chairs, drink beer from coolers, laugh and talk. They 
watch the center of the crater, where LARGE MEN have formed 
a line to take a turn with the mysterious object. One of 
them struggles and fails to lift it. As he gives up, the 
next man steps up and takes his turn, straining from the 
effort. Other Townies SNAP PICTURES of the scene with their 
cell phones. They hear an approaching RUMBLE, then clear a 
path as a large PICK-UP TRUCK backs its way down the 
crater's edge. An EAGER TOWNIE hops out the passenger side 
and pulls a thick chain from the back of the truck. He 
fastens one end around the object, then securely affixes the 
chain to the bumper and the rear of the undercarriage.

EAGER TOWNIE
This'll do it.

He yells to the driver.

EAGER TOWNIE (CONT'D)
Okay, let 'er rip! The townsfolk 
watch as the pick-up's engine 
ROARS, then STRAINS, its wheels 
spinning futilely, until finally 
the rear of the truck, along with 
the back wheels and axles, break 
off and go flying.

People dive out of the way. The PICK-UP DRIVER sticks his 
head out. He is STAN "THE MAN"¬ù LEE. He looks back, 
shocked. The townsfolk laugh, the party continuing. They 
don't notice as --

ON THE CRATER'S EDGE ABOVE THEM

An imposing GOVERNMENT VEHICLE pulls up to a stop. A Fed in 
a suit climbs out, peers down at the boisterous gathering 
below, his eyes fixed on the object at the center of the 
crater. He is SHIELD AGENT COULSON. He stares down at the 
object which glows with an otherworldly blue energy -- 
MJOLNIR. He pulls out a phone.

63.


COULSON

(INTO PHONE)
Sir -- we've found it.

INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 60

60

In a back room, Thor, now shirtless and wearing jeans, looks 
around for a t-shirt. Jane and Darcy, standing in the lab, 
can't help but notice his reflection in the mirror. Darcy 
eyes his powerful build, rippling biceps.

DARCY
You know, for a crazy homeless guy, 
he's pretty cut. Jane turns away. 
Thor emerges from the back room, 
holding a t-shirt.

DARCY (CONT'D)
Hey, sorry I tased you! Thor heads 
over to Jane's work area, starts 
fiddling with the equipment there 
with interest. Jane hurries over to 
put a stop to it.

JANE
Excuse me... excuse me! She leads 
him away from the work station. 
Thor holds up the t-shirt. On the 
front, it bear a sticker which 
reads: "HELLO, MY NAME IS DR. 
DONALD BLAKE"¬ù. Thor looks at it, 
puzzled. Jane rips the sticker off.

JANE (CONT'D)
My ex.

Thor stares at her a beat.

JANE (CONT'D)
They're the only clothes I had 
that'll fit you. Sorry.

THOR
They will suffice. Thor turns his 
attention to the pictures of the 
Bifrost on the wall.

JANE
You're welcome. Now tell me... Thor 
studies the frame-grabs with 
interest. Jane points to his form 
in the Bifrost photo.

64.


JANE (CONT'D)
What were you doing, in that? He 
glances at it, dismissive.

THOR
What does anyone do in the Bifrost? 
Everyone stares at him. Selvig 
seems to recognize the word. Jane 
opens her notebook, quickly writes 
the word down. Thor moves close to 
her, eyes the notations and 
drawings within the book, curious.

SELVIG
(amused, skeptical)
The Bifrost...

Jane starts to get uncomfortable with Thor standing so close 
to her, looking over her notations. She quickly closes the 
book.

JANE
What exactly is the Bifrost?

THOR
(IGNORING HER)
This mortal form has grown weak.

JANE
BUT--

JANE (CONT'D)
Somebody get the mortal a Pop-Tart.

INT. ODIN'S CHAMBERS - DAY 61
61
61

Frigga sits at her husband's bedside, holding his hand. Odin 
lies there -- looking pale and lifeless, his body and the 
space around it warped from the effect of the Odinsleep. The 
walls of the chamber have moved close around him, protecting 
him like a dark crypt, sealing off any daylight. Loki sits 
at Odin's side, across from Frigga. She speaks softly to 
him.

FRIGGA
I asked him to be honest with you 
from the beginning. There should be 
no secrets in a family.

LOKI
So why did he lie?

65.


FRIGGA
He kept the truth from you so that 
you would never feel different. You 
are in every way our son, Loki, and 
we your family. You must know that.

Loki takes this in, stares at Odin.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)
(RE: ODIN)
You can speak to him. He can see 
and hear us, even now.

LOKI
How long will it last?

FRIGGA
I don't know. This time is 
different. We were unprepared.

LOKI
I never get used to seeing him like 
this. The most powerful being in 
the Nine Realms lying helpless 
until his body is restored.

FRIGGA
But he's put it off for so long 
now, I fear...

Loki takes her hand. She's grateful, wipes tears from her 
eyes.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)
You're a good son. Loki sits there, 
uncertain how to react, uncertain 
how he really feels.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)
We mustn't lose hope that your 
father will return to us. And your 
brother.

Loki looks to Frigga, concerned.

LOKI
What hope is there for Thor?

FRIGGA
There's always a purpose to 
everything your father does. Thor 
may yet find a way home. Loki looks 
troubled by the revelation. 
(MORE)

66.


He rises, heads for the exit, when 
they hear the clatter of ARMORED 
FOOTSTEPS hurriedly approaching.

THE EINHERJAR GUARD

Enter the room, block his way out. Loki tenses, prepared for 
the worst, but the guards just stand before them. Loki is 
baffled.

FRIGGA
Thor is banished. The line of 
succession falls to you. Until he 
awakens, Asgard is yours.

The Einherjar kneel before the shocked Loki. Another 
EINHERJAR enters, holding Gungnir before him. He kneels 
before Loki, offers the spear to him.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)
Make your father proud. Loki 
reaches out tentatively, then takes 
it. He likes the feel of it in his 
hand.

INT. ISABELA'S DINER - MORNING 62
62
62

Thor, Selvig, Darcy, and Jane sit at a table in the local 
diner. Selvig and Darcy watch as Thor eats ravenously from a 
huge mound of steak and eggs. A couple other full plates -- 
pancakes and biscuits and gravy -- are piled high before 
him. Jane's eager, her notebook at the ready.

JANE
Now tell us exactly what happened 
to you last night. Thor looks her 
in the eyes, staring, intrigued. 
Jane gets flustered, looks away.

JANE (CONT'D)
Maybe start with how you got inside 
that cloud.

DARCY
And how you could eat an entire box 
of Pop-Tarts and still be this 
hungry.

Jane shoots her a withering look. Thor downs a cup of 
coffee.

THOR
(re: coffee mug)
This drink. I like it.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)

67.


DARCY
(to Thor, re: coffee)
Yeah, it's great, isn't it? Isabela 
makes the best coffee in town.

Thor hurls the empty mug at the ground, SHATTERING it.

THOR
(CALLS OUT)
Another!

ISABELA ALVAREZ (60), the diner's proprietor, glares at Thor 
from behind the counter.

JANE
Sorry, Izzy. Little accident.

(IN SPANISH)
Yo voy a pagar la taza. Isabela 
turns to a WAITRESS and starts 
venting quickly in Spanish.

ISABELA

(IN SPANISH)
Did you see that? The first time 
she brings a man in here, and he's 
a lunatic!

JANE
(to Thor, re: mug)
What was that?

He doesn't understand. The other patrons stare at him.

THOR
It was delicious. I want another.

JANE
Then you should just say so!

THOR
I just did.

JANE
I mean ask for it. Nicely.

THOR
I meant no disrespect.

JANE
All right, then no more smashing, 
deal?

68.


THOR
You have my word.

JANE
Good.

A few TOWNIES, looking bedraggled, enter and take a seat at 
the counter. We recognize them from the crater. (Among them 
is the Drunk Townie Jake, who is not presently drunk.)

ISABELA
Morning, Pete. Jake.

TOWNIE PETE
The usual, please, Izzy. Isabela 
pours them a couple cups of coffee.

DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE

You missed all the excitement out at the crater.

ISABELA
What crater?

Jane and Selvig overhear this, exchange a look, turn to the 
Townies with interest.

TOWNIE PETE
They're saying some kind of 
satellite crashed in the desert.

DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE

We were having a good time with it till the Feds showed up, 
chased us out.

JANE
(to the Townies)
Excuse me, did you say there was a 
satellite crash?

DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE

Yep. They said it was radioactive. And I had my hands all 
over it.

(REALIZING)
I'm probably sterile now. Thor, 
unconcerned, prepares to dig into 
the giant pile of pancakes. Darcy 
is amazed by the sight.

69.


DARCY
Oh my God, this is going on 
Facebook.

Darcy whips out her cellphone.

DARCY (CONT'D)
(TO THOR)
Smile!

Thor looks puzzled as she SNAPS a photo of him and his 
massive stack of food.

SELVIG
(to the Townies)
What did the satellite look like?

DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE

I don't know nothing about satellites. But it was heavy. 
Real heavy. Nobody could lift it. This gets Thor's 
attention.

Thor springs to his feet, heads over to Drunk Townie Jake, 
and pulls the Townie around to face him.

THOR
Where?!

DRUNK TOWNIE JAKE

About twelve miles east of here. Thor grins, his spirits 
soaring, as he quickly strides out of the diner.

PETE
I wouldn't bother! Looked like the 
whole Army was coming in when we 
left!

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 63
63
63

Thor studies the position of the sun, gauging his bearings. 
Jane, Darcy, and Selvig catch up to him.

JANE
Where are you going?

THOR
Twelve miles east of here. He 
starts to stride determinedly down 
the street. Jane walks with him.

JANE
Why?

70.


THOR
To get what belongs to me.

JANE
So now you own a satellite?

THOR
It's not what they say it is.

JANE
Whatever it is, the government 
seems to think it's theirs. You 
intend to just walk in there and 
take it?

THOR
Yes.

He stops walking.

THOR (CONT'D)
If you take me there now, I'll tell 
you everything you wish to know.

JANE
Everything?

THOR
All the answers you seek will be 
yours, once I reclaim Mjolnir. 
Darcy looks to the others.

DARCY
"Myeu-muh?"¬ù What's "Myeu-muh?"¬ù 
Jane studies Thor. He looks 
sincere. She's nearly swayed,

WHEN:

SELVIG
Jane.

He pulls her aside. Thor can tell that Selvig doesn't much 
care for him.

SELVIG (CONT'D)
(TO JANE)
Please don't do this.

JANE
You know what we saw last night. 
This can't be a coincidence. I want 
to know what's in that crater.

71.


SELVIG
I'm not talking about the crater. 
I'm talking about him.

JANE
He's promised us answers.

SELVIG
He's delusional! Listen to what 
he's saying! "Thor."¬ù "Bifrost."¬ù 
"Mjolnir."¬ù These are the stories 
I grew up with as a child!

JANE
I'd just be driving him out there, 
that's all.

SELVIG
It's dangerous. He's dangerous.

After a moment, she nods. They head back over to Thor and 
Darcy.

JANE
I'm sorry. I can't take you.

THOR
I understand. Then this is where we 
say goodbye.

He takes her hand and kisses it.

JANE
That's... thank you. Thor bows 
slightly to each of them.

THOR
Jane Foster... Erik Selvig... 
Darcy. Farewell. He heads off down 
the street. Selvig looks relieved.

SELVIG
Now... let's get back to the lab. 
We have work to do. Selvig and 
Darcy turn and start to go. Jane 
looks after Thor as he walks away 
down the street.

Two EINHERJAR GUARDS enter, admitting Sif and the Warriors 
Three, who burst through the entrance, heads bowed.

SIF
Allfather, we must speak with you

URGENTLY--
But as they raise their heads, they 
stop short to see --

LOKI
Sitting sprawled upon his father's 
throne. He wears his horned 
ceremonial headdress and holds 
GUNGNIR in his hand. Sif and the 
others look up, shocked at the 
sight before them.

VOLSTAGG
What is this?

LOKI
My friends... you haven't heard? I 
am now Ruler of Asgard.

FANDRAL
Where is Odin?

LOKI
Father's fallen into the Odinsleep. 
My mother fears he may never awaken 
again.

SIF
We would speak with her. Sif and 
the Warriors Three exchange a look. 
Loki notices.

LOKI
She has refused to leave my 
father's bedside. You can bring 
your "urgent"¬ù matter to me, your 
King.

Sif covers quickly.

SIF
We would ask you to end Thor's 
banishment.

73.


LOKI
My first command can not be to undo 
the Allfather's last. We're on the 
brink of war with Jotunheim. Our 
people must have a sense of 
continuity in order to feel safe in 
these difficult times. Sif and the 
Warriors Three trade looks, not 
liking any of this.

LOKI (CONT'D)
All of us must stand together, for 
the good of Asgard.

FANDRAL
Of course.

Sif and the Warriors Three bow their heads and exit. Loki 
stares after them.

EXT. PUENTE ANTIGUO, NEW MEXICO - MAIN STREET - DAY 66

Jane, Selvig, and Darcy head up the street. They're by 
Arturo's, when a PICK-UP TRUCK pulls up before them, stopped 
by traffic. In the back of the vehicle, Jane notices, 
partially covered by a tarp, the dark matter analysis 
machine from her lab.

JANE
Hey! That's my stuff!

EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 66A

Jane, Selvig, and Darcy reach the lab, where government 
vehicles are parked. SHIELD AGENTS haul equipment out of the 
lab and load it into waiting vans. Other Agents strip all 
the equipment from inside the Pinzgauer and cart it away. 
Still others emerge from her trailer, arms loaded with 
scientific instruments and documents.

JANE
What the hell is going on here?! 
The Agents ignore her as Agent 
Coulson approaches.

COULSON
Ms. Foster, I'm Agent Coulson, with

SHIELD.

Selvig, recognizing the name of the organization, grows 
wary.

74.


JANE
I don't care who you work for, you 
can't do this!

SELVIG
Jane. This is more serious than you 
realize. Let it go.

JANE
Let it go?! This is my life!

COULSON
We're here investigating a security 
threat. We need to appropriate your 
equipment and all your atmospheric 
data.

JANE
By "appropriate"¬ù you mean 
"steal?"¬ù Instead of answering, 
Coulson gives her a check.

COULSON
This should more than compensate 
you for your trouble. She throws 
the check to the ground without 
looking at it.

JANE
I can't just pick up replacements 
from RadioShack! I made most of 
that equipment myself!

COULSON
Then I'm sure you can do it again.

JANE
And I'm sure I can sue you for 
violating my constitutional rights!

COULSON
We're the good guys, Ms. Foster. He 
tries to walk away, but Jane blocks 
his path. She is fully herself, 
fueled by outrage.

JANE
So are we! We're on the verge of

UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING
extraordinary.

Jane holds up her notebook.

75.


JANE
Everything I know about this 
phenomenon is in this lab and in 
this book, and no one has the right 
to take it from me. Coulson 
gestures to a nearby AGENT, who 
promptly plucks the notebook out of 
Jane's hands and adds it to the 
pile he's carrying. Jane is 
stunned.

COULSON
Thank you for your cooperation. He 
gets into a car. The cars and 
trucks pull away.

Jane, Selvig, and Darcy enter, staring in shock at the now- 
empty space.

JANE
Years of research, gone.

DARCY
They even took my iPod.

SELVIG
And your back-ups?

JANE
Look around! They took our back- 
ups. They took the back-ups of our 
back-ups.

DARCY
I just downloaded, like, thirty 
songs on there.

JANE
(TO DARCY)
Will you please stop talking about 
your iPod?!

(TO SELVIG)
Who are these people?

SELVIG
No one knows much about them. But I 
knew a scientist -- a pioneer in 
gamma radiation. SHIELD showed up, 
and he was never heard from again.

76.


JANE
I'm not going to let them do this. 
I'm getting everything back.

SELVIG
Please, let me contact one of my 
colleagues. Dr. Pym has had some 
dealings with these people. I'll e- 
mail him and see if he can help.

DARCY
They took your laptop, too. 
Annoyed, Selvig thinks.

Selvig and Jane in the Pinzgauer drive up in front of the 
town's rinky-dink library. A sign in the window reads, "FREE

Thor enters the store and approaches a PET STORE CLERK.

THOR
I need a horse.

PET STORE CLERK

Sorry, we don't sell horses. Just dogs, cats, birds.

THOR
Then give me one of those, large 
enough to ride.

The Pet Store Clerk looks confused. Just then, Thor hears a 
CAR HORN. He turns to the open door. Across the street, Jane 
calls to him from the Pinzgauer.

JANE
You still want a lift?

INT. PUENTE ANTIGUO LIBRARY - DAY 68A

It's story time in the library, as a LIBRARIAN reads a book -

77.


LIBRARIAN

(READING)
"And though they're large, giants 
can be quiet. You have to listen 
carefully for the sound of their 
footsteps -- because they may be

Selvig sits at a computer terminal,

him, a KID flips through a book 
with interest. The Librarian stops 
mid-story and calls to the Kid 
pleasantly.

LIBRARIAN
Joshua, come sit down. It's story 
time.

The Kid closes his book and joins the others. Selvig looks 
over, notices the title of the book the Kid was reading --

"MYTHS AND LEGENDS FROM AROUND THE WORLD."¬Ù

He picks it up, flips through it, stops at the section on 
Scandinavian Mythology. It's a picture of a RAINBOW BRIDGE 
coming down from Asgard to earth. ASGARDIANS walk upon it, 
among them ODIN, LOKI, and THOR, who wields Mjolnir. On the 
ground below them, a group of VIKINGS kneel reverently. He 
eyes the illustration, pondering.

Jane drives, pumped with adrenaline, nervous and excited, as

JANE
I've never done anything like this

like this before? Thor looks amused 
by her excitement.

THOR
Many times. You're brave to do it.

JANE
They just stole my entire life's 
work. I really don't have anything 
left to lose.

THOR
But you're clever. Far more clever 
than anyone else in this Realm.

JANE
"This Realm?"¬ù Why do you talk 
like that?

THOR
You think me strange? Jane laughs, 
catches herself.

JANE
Yeah. Just a little.

THOR
Good strange or bad strange?

JANE
I'm not quite sure yet. She looks 
at him, sees him staring at her. 
She's lost in his gaze, distracted, 
when the PINZGAUER LURCHES. She 
quickly turns her eyes forward, 
regains control of the car.

JANE (CONT'D)
Sorry.

She glances back at him. He's confident, determined.

JANE (CONT'D)
Who are you? Really?

THOR
You'll see soon enough.

JANE
You promised me answers.

Thor looks at her, charmed by her persistence.

THOR
What you seek -- it's a bridge.

JANE
A bridge? Like an Einstein-Rosen

As the Pinzgauer heads away, we continue up a hillside, 
revealing a light illuminating the valley beyond. As we move 
closer, we see the glow comes from --

A MASSIVE SHIELD BASE

Now set up around the crater -- vehicles, trailers, 
barricades. Armed GUARDS man a gate in the razor wire fence 
that runs fifty yards from the crater's edge, enclosing the 
complex. Clear, plastic access tubes with junction boxes 
lead to a translucent cube structure erected in the middle 
of the crater. Through the glass walls of the base's command 
trailer, we see Coulson directing TECHNICIANS, busy at work. 
Within the cube structure itself, a team of SHIELD 
SCIENTISTS work with high-tech machinery, analyzing the 
object at the center of it all -- Mjolnir.

EXT. RIDGE ABOVE CRATER - NIGHT 72

Jane and Thor crawl to the edge of the ridge, look through

JANE
That isn't a satellite crash. They 
would have hauled the wreckage 
away, not built a city around it. 
Thor shrugs out of his jacket and 
hands it to her.

THOR
You're going to need this.

JANE
Why?--

Thunder RUMBLES overhead. She stares at him intently and 
takes his jacket.

THOR
Stay here. Once I have Mjolnir, I 
will return what they stole from 
you.

80.


He looks to her, already knowing that Jane may disobey his 
request.

THOR (CONT'D)
Deal?

JANE
No! Look what's down there! You 
can't just walk in, grab our stuff, 
and walk out!

THOR
No.

Jane looks relieved.

THOR (CONT'D)
I'm going to fly out. Before she 
can react, he starts heading 
towards the crater. The first drops 
of rain begin to patter into the 
dust.

JANE
Wait...

But Thor is already headed towards the crater.

towards the hammer. He checks a

TECHIE (CONT'D)
Hey, we've got a commercial 
aircraft coming in right over us, 
Southwest Airlines Flight 5434.

SITWELL
Reroute it, like all the others.

TECHIE
Right. Can I get the passengers 
some free drinks for the trouble? 
Sitwell glares at him.

TECHIE (CONT'D)

It'd be a nice gesture. The Techie 
types into the computer, when he 
notices something on another 
screen, holds up a hand.

TECHIE (CONT'D)
Hold a sec... we got something 
outside the fence, west side... He 
points at the screen. Through the

then, the Agents notice a section 
of the fence has been bent up from 
the ground, leaving a gap.

Before they can call it in, a massive CRACK OF LIGHTNING 
illuminates the night sky -- revealing the silhouette of a 
large man standing outside the driver's (Jackson's) side of 
the jeep. DeLancey looks over, notices.

AGENT DELANCEY
Jackson?

The Agents reach for their weapons. Thor elbows the driver 
across the jaw, causing him to drop his weapon. Jackson 
slumps over the steering wheel, as DeLancey starts to raise 
a shotgun at Thor. Thor grabs the barrel, yanks it out of 
DeLancey's hands and thrusts the hilt back, smashing the 
Agent's jaw. Thor reaches into the jeep to grab a rain 
slicker.

out her cellphone and dials. We hear Selvig's recorded 
message.

SELVIG (V.O., ON PHONE)
You've reached Dr. Erik Selvig. 
Please leave me a message. His 
voicemail BEEPS. She talks quietly, 
urgently.

JANE
Erik, okay, first of all, don't 
worry. I'm perfectly fine, really. 
More sounds of MAYHEM come from the 
base.

JANE (CONT'D)
But if you don't hear from me 
again, you might want to come out 
to the crater site and look for me. 
I kind of did what you said I 
shouldn't do. Thanks. Bye. She 
hangs up.

Coulson emerges from the SHIELD command trailer and marches 
across the mud, radio to his ear. He looks out across the 
lit up site uneasily.

EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 80

A SHIELD GUARD moves through the base, rifle in hand. From 
the shadows behind a trailer, a FIGURE looks out at him. As 
the Guard raises his radio to check in, Thor quickly rushes 
towards him and chokes him out. He falls to the ground. 

84.


Thor notices the AR-15 rifle lying on the ground beside the 
fallen Guard. He stares down at the weapon quizzically. As 
more GUARDS approach, Thor snatches up the weapon and takes 
cover in the shadows of the trailer. The Guards pass by. 
Thor peers around the corner, sees the well-guarded main 
entrance tube to the center of the site. A bright light 
suddenly illuminates his face. He looks to see an ATV moving 
across the site, shining its spotlight right on him. Thor 
sees that the ATV DRIVER has spotted him. The Driver raises 
his radio to report. Thor knows he has to act fact. He 
raises the rifle -- then flips it over in the air and 
catches it by the barrel. He rears the weapon back, then 
hurls it like a hammer. It flies through the air, smashing 
the ATV's spotlight. Glass and debris shower the driver, who 
takes his hands off the wheel to protect himself. The ATV 
roars out of control past the Guards near the tube entrance. 
The Guards notice and chase after it. Thor emerges from the 
shadows, watches the Guards abandoning the site entrance.

The ATV Driver looks forward in panic as the ATV approaches 
the crater lip. The vehicle careens over the edge of the 
crater and heads straight for one of the plastic tunnels. 
The Technicians inside scatter as the ATV CRASHES into it, 
tearing into the tunnel, sending sparks everywhere. The ATV 
finally comes to a stop, the tunnel collapsing around it and 
the Driver. SHIELD AGENTS rush in behind to help.

Thor races up the entrance ramp. Before him, two GUARDS

tackles the second. He hurries around the corner, when more 
GUARDS come up a ladder ahead. Thor punches the closest 
Guard, sending him tumbling backwards, toppling the others 
on the ladder behind him. Thor takes off running, as the 
Guards regroup and give chase. Thor spots the glow of 
Mjolnir in the central cube, through the translucent walls 
of the tunnels. He hurries through to tunnels to find a way 
towards it.

down the last Agent, Thor sees the last junction box and the 
entrance to the cube structure up ahead. He races towards 
it. He can actually see Mjolnir within the middle of the 
structure, when -- BAM! From out of nowhere, a fist lands a 
powerful blow across his jaw, sending him reeling. Dazed, 
Thor looks up to see --

A HUGE SHIELD AGENT

The biggest of them all, standing between him and his hammer

forward, whipping his feet in front of him, then kicks out, 
nailing the Huge Agent in the chest. The Agent goes down 
hard as Thor's momentum carries him past. Thor stands, heads 
for the cube structure, when the Huge Guard grabs his ankle 
in a last effort. Thor looks back down at his foe, then 
drops backwards, pile driving his elbow into the fallen 
Agent's chest. The Huge Agent grimaces in pain, defeated. 
Thor races back towards the structure.

him, energy surging around it. Coulson steps into the 
structure through an access tunnel, one story up.

As Thor approaches his hammer, Mjolnir starts to glow 
brighter, blue electricity sparking off its surface. The

the hammer doesn't move. Thor looks confused, tries again 
with two hands, to no avail -- anger and frustration 
overtaking him. He strains with all his might, SCREAMS from 
the effort, bellowing up at the storm and lightning above 
him. Something begins to appear on the side of Mjolnir -- 
glowing RUNES. Thor looks down, sees them. But, still, the 
hammer doesn't budge. Thor falls to his knees before it, 
rain pouring down around him, as the glowing runes fade 
away. He's failed. Unworthy. Coulson looks on, disappointed. 
SHIELD AGENTS move in, guns trained on Thor, surrounding 
him. Coulson activates his radio.

COULSON
Ground units, move in. Show's over.

As the Agents surround him, Thor doesn't seem to notice or 
care. He just sits there on his knees, head bowed in the 
rain -- a man broken, lost. From overhead, we see the hammer

Your banishment, the threat of a

bear.

The implications of Loki's words dawn on Thor -- he's 
responsible for his father's fate. Loki draws close to him, 
looks in his eyes, consolingly.

You mustn't blame yourself. I know 
that you loved him. I tried to tell 
him so, but he wouldn't listen.

You have dangerous coworkers, Dr. 
Selvig.

95.


SELVIG
Troubled, not dangerous. He was 
distraught when he found out that 
you'd taken all of our research. It 
was years of his life, gone! He got 
depressed, started drinking, and... 
well, you know the rest.

COULSON
Uh-huh. You mind if we take a 
moment to verify his identity?

SELVIG
Certainly.

The Techie at a computer nearby runs the name.

SELVIG (CONT'D)
You can understand how a man could 
go off like that. I mean, a big, 
faceless organization like yours, 
coming in with their jack-booted 
thugs and stealing private 
property...

(THEN)
...is how he described it.

COULSON
That doesn't explain how he managed 
to tear through our security. 
Selvig shrugs.

SELVIG
Steroids. He's a bit of a fitness 
nut.

On the Techie's monitor, a DMV record from the State of New 
York pops up reading "DR. DONALD BLAKE"¬ù. The license photo 
is indeed a picture of Thor -- the one Darcy took with her 
cellphone.

The Techie hits a button, and a graphic reads, "SHIELD 
SECURITY ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS."¬ù Coulson eyes the screen. 
After a beat, he turns back to Selvig.

COULSON
It says here he's an M.D.

SELVIG
He is. That is, he was. He switched 
careers and became a physicist. 
He's quite brilliant, really.

96.


(THEN)
If you would just release him to 
me, I promise to keep an eye on 
him.

Coulson thinks, sizing Selvig up -- then smiles. He turns to 
an AGENT nearby.

COULSON
Release Dr. Blake to Dr. Selvig 
here.

The Techie looks to him, surprised.

COULSON (CONT'D)
(TO SELVIG)
Make sure he stays in town for the 
next few days in case we need to 
talk to him again. Selvig shakes 
his hand.

SELVIG
Thank you.

INT. SHIELD HOLDING CELL - NIGHT 92A
92A
92A

Selvig bursts into the room with a SHIELD Agent to find a 
seated Thor.

SELVIG
Donny, Donny, Donny! There you are!

Thor looks up, unsure what the hell is going on. Selvig 
pulls Thor to his feet, gives him a warm hug.

SELVIG (CONT'D)
It's going to be all right, my 
friend. Come on, I'm taking you 
home.

He leads the bewildered Thor out the door.

EXT. COULSON'S TRAILER - NIGHT 92B
92B
92B

As Thor and Selvig make their way past the SHIELD Security 
Room, Thor notices Jane's possessions and equipment from the 
Smith Motors lab stacked under a tarp. He spots Jane's hand- 
written journal among them. As he passes, he quickly takes 
it from the pile and pockets it.

INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT 92C
92C
92C

Coulson looks at the computer bearing Donald Blake's DMV 
record. 

97.


A security warning over the image clearly reads "SECURITY 
ALERT: FALSIFIED DATA."¬ù He knows it's been a ruse all 
along. He looks to Selvig and Thor heading away from the 
Security Room, then follows them outside.

EXT. SHIELD DESERT BASE - NIGHT 93

93

Coulson and two SHIELD Agents watch as Selvig walks with 
Thor away from the base to the SUV. Coulson calls to Selvig.

COULSON
Just keep him away from the bars.

SELVIG
I will!

THOR
(TO SELVIG)
Where are we going? Selvig drops 
his cool demeanor.

SELVIG
To get a drink.

Selvig and Thor climb into the SUV. As they drive off, 
Coulson turns to the other two agents -- GARRETT and CALE.

COULSON
Follow them.

EXT. JOTUNHEIM - DAY 94

Loki, looking apprehensive, walks alone across the icy 
surface of the planet.

INT. LAUFEY'S TEMPLE - DAY 95
95
95

Darkness shrouds the ruined temple, save for the shafts of 
light which knife their way in through the damaged ceiling. 
Loki enters. Frost Giant guards surround him on all sides. 
Laufey approaches, towers over him menacingly.

LAUFEY
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you.

LOKI
I've come alone and unarmed.

LAUFEY
To what end?

LOKI
To make you another proposition.

98.


LAUFEY
(REALIZING)
So you're the one who let us into 
Asgard.

LOKI
You're welcome.

LAUFEY
My men are dead, and I have no 
Casket. You are a deceiver. Laufey 
lashes out, grabs Loki around the 
throat, but Loki calmly stands his 
ground.

LOKI
You have no idea what I am. The 
blueness spreads across his face, 
as Laufey and the guards stare in 
shock. Loki grins.

LOKI (CONT'D)
Hello, Father.

Laufey releases him. Loki's body turns back to normal. 
Intrigued, Laufey sizes up his son.

LAUFEY
Ah, the bastard son. I thought Odin 
had killed you. That's what I would 
have done. He's as weak as you are.

LOKI
No longer weak. I now rule Asgard, 
until Odin awakens. Perhaps you 
should not have so carelessly 
abandoned me.

This gives Laufey pause.

LAUFEY
Or perhaps it was the wisest choice 
I've ever made. I will hear you.

LOKI
I will conceal you and a handful of 
your soldiers, lead you into his 
chambers, and let you slay him 
where he lies. I'll keep the 
throne, and you will have the 
Casket.

Laufey studies Loki's face.

99.


LAUFEY
Why would you do this?

LOKI
When all is done, we will have a 
permanent peace between our two 
worlds. Then I, the bastard son, 
will have accomplished what Odin 
and Thor never could.

LAUFEY
This is a great day for Jotunheim. 
Asgard is finally ours.

LOKI
No. Asgard is mine. The rest of the 
Nine Realms will be yours, if you 
do as you're told. Laufey considers 
the proposition.

LAUFEY
I accept.

Loki turns to leave. As he goes, the slightest trace of a 
smile crosses his face.

INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 96
96
96

Loki emerges out of the Bifrost, as Heimdall steps away from 
his controls. Heimdall glares at Loki. Loki notices.

LOKI
What troubles you, Gatekeeper?

HEIMDALL
I turned my gaze upon you in 
Jotunheim, but could neither see 
nor hear you. You were shrouded 
from me, like the Frost Giants who 
entered this Realm.

LOKI
Perhaps your senses have weakened 
after your many years of service.

HEIMDALL
Or perhaps someone has found a way 
to hide that which he does not wish 
me to see.

Loki sizes him up, smiles.

100.


LOKI
You have great power, Heimdall. 
Tell me, did Odin ever fear you?

HEIMDALL
No.

LOKI
And why is that?

HEIMDALL
Because he is my King, and I am 
sworn to obey him.

LOKI
Exactly. Just as you're sworn to 
obey me now. Yes? A beat.

HEIMDALL
Yes.

LOKI
Good. Then you will open the 
Bifrost to no one until I have 
undone what my brother has started. 
Loki heads out of the Observatory. 
Heimdall stares after him.

INT. BAR - NIGHT 97
97
97

Thor and Selvig sit at a booth at the back of the local 
dive. The bartender sets down a couple mugs of beer and two 
shots of whiskey. Selvig pours the shot into his mug and 
downs it. Thor follows his example.

SELVIG
Seems Darcy's a terrible intern, 
but a talented hacker.

THOR
Thank you for what you've done.

SELVIG
Don't thank me. I only did it for 
Jane.

THOR
Are you in love with her?

SELVIG
Of course not! Jane's like a 
daughter to me. Her father and I 
taught at University together. 
(MORE)

101.


A good man, but he never listened. 
This registers with Thor.

THOR
Neither did I.

Selvig eyes him with interest.

SELVIG
I don't know if you're really 
delusional, and I really don't care 
at this point. I just care about 
her. I've seen the way she looks at 
you.

THOR
I swear to you, I mean her no harm.

SELVIG
Good. If that's the case, then I'll 
buy you one more drink, and you'll 
leave town tonight. A long pause, 
then Thor nods. He takes a drink.

THOR
I had it all backwards. I had it 
all wrong.

Selvig watches him keenly. This is a different Thor than 
he's seen before.

SELVIG
It's not a bad thing, finding out 
that you don't have all the 
answers. That's when you start 
asking the right questions. Thor 
takes this in.

THOR
For the first time in my life, I 
have no idea what I'm supposed to 
do.

SELVIG
Anyone who's ever going to find 
their way in this world has to 
start by admitting they don't know 
where the hell they are. Thor nods.

DRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.)
Hey, I know you, man... An 
intimidating DRUNK TOWNIE nearby 
sizes up Thor. 

SELVIG (CONT'D)

(MORE)

102.


He is one of the Townies from 
Isabela's Diner who saw Thor 
earlier. He approaches, belligerent 
and looking for a fight.

DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
You were in the diner with that hot 
girl.

Thor doesn't like where this is going.

DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D)
I wouldn't mind her doing a little 
research on me.

He laughs. Thor is annoyed.

THOR
I have no quarrel with you. But 
she's a lady. You should be more 
respectful.

DRUNK TOWNIE
And you should shut the hell up, 
princess.

Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. 
But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the 
Townie's baiting.

THOR
I will not fight him.

DRUNK TOWNIE
Then it'll be easy to kick your 
ass.

Selvig stands, steps between the two men.

SELVIG
Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our 
heads.

Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out. 
Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his 
glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.

SELVIG (CONT'D)
(TO THOR)
Another drink?

DRUNK TOWNIE (O.S.) (CONT'D)

103.


EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 98
98
98

Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN 
FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance 
routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically 
in time with the song.

THOR/SELVIG

(SINGING)
"The mood is good, our hearts are 
full, there's magic in the air. / 
It's all because we're here 
tonight, and haven't got a care. / 
So raise a glass, and toast to 
life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la- 
la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine 
indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a 
friend is fine indeed!"¬ù Thor 
holds up a hand for Selvig's last 
finishing slap. Selvig misses it 
completely and falls out of frame 
like a straight dead weight with a 
CLUNK. WIDE SHOT. Emerging from 
behind the car where Selvig fell, 
Thor stands up, Selvig slung over 
his shoulder, and starts to walk up 
the street towards Jane's trailer.

INT. JANE'S TRAILER - NIGHT 99
99
99

The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, 
strewn with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried 
Jane lies on her bed, trying to read. She's startled by the 
loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to the door and opens it 
to find --

THOR
Standing there with the unconscious 
Selvig slung over his shoulder.

JANE
Erik!

(TO THOR)
Is he all right?

THOR
He's fine. Not injured at all.

As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway. 
Selvig GROANS.

104.


THOR (CONT'D)
Sorry, my friend.

JANE
What happened?

THOR
We drank. We fought. He made his 
ancestors proud.

JANE
Put him on the bed. Thor moves 
through the small trailer carrying 
Selvig, like a bear lugging another 
bear, smashing into things along 
the way, until he finally sets 
Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig 
awakens groggily and looks up at 
him through bleary eyes.

SELVIG
I still don't believe you're the 
God of Thunder.

(THEN)
But you ought to be. Thor grins, 
pats him on the cheek. As Selvig 
drifts off to sleep, Thor pulls a 
blanket over him. Jane watches, 
stunned by their friendship, 
impressed by Thor's tenderness. 
Thor turns back to her, looks 
around.

THOR
These are your chambers? Jane 
suddenly becomes self-conscious. 
She starts cleaning up the mess 
around her.

JANE
Well, it's more of a temporary 
living space, really. I don't 
usually have visitors in here. 
Actually, never... Thor picks up a 
sock off the floor. She snatches it 
from him, puts it away.

JANE (CONT'D)
Can we go outside?

105.


EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 100
100
100

Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He 
offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set 
up, a couple chairs, some blankets.

JANE
I come up here sometimes when I 
can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to 
reconcile particle data. Or when 
Darcy's driving me crazy.

(THEN)
I come up here a lot, now that I 
think about it.

Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars.

JANE
I'm glad you're safe.

THOR
You've been very kind. I've been 
far less grateful than you deserve.

JANE
I also hit you with my car a couple 
times, so it kind of evens out. He 
grins, then reaches into his pocket 
and pulls out her

NOTEBOOK.

JANE
I don't believe it... She takes it 
from him, surprised and grateful.

THOR
It was all I could get back. Not as 
much as I promised. I'm sorry.

JANE
No, this is good. Thank you. This 
means I don't have to start from 
scratch...

She sits down and opens the notebook eagerly, then stops, a 
harsh realization clouding her face. Thor notices.

THOR
What's wrong?

106.


JANE
SHIELD, whatever they are. They're 
never going to let this research 
see the light of day.

THOR
You must do this. You must finish 
what you've started.

JANE
Why?

THOR
Because you're right. It's taken so 
many generations for your people to 
get to this point. You're nearly 
there. You just need someone to 
show you how close you really are.

Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page 
which bears a sketch of the Bifrost. He takes the pen from 
the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one 
point to another in space.

THOR (CONT'D)
Look -- your ancestors called it 
magic. You call it science. I come 
from a place where they're one and 
the same thing. We recognize that 
Thor is drawing the branches of 
Yggdrasil as she looks on, amazed 
and intrigued.

JANE
What is it?

THOR
This is how my father explained it 
to me...

(THEN)
Your world is one of the Nine 
Realms of the Cosmos, linked to 
each other by the branches of 
Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now, 
you see it every day, without 
realizing. Images glimpsed through -
- what did you call it?...
(checks her notebook)
...this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine 
Realms...

They look at each other. She nods. They smile. This is going 
to be a long night.

107.


EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - LATER 101

Jane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop. He 
stares up at the night sky. She rolls close to him, nuzzles 
against him in her sleep. He looks down at her, beautiful in 
the moonlight, looks out at the town beyond her.

INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 102

102

Volstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD. Sif stands 
nearby, ill at ease. Fandral watches Volstagg incredulously 
as the large warrior stuffs himself. Finally Fandral can 
stand it no more.

FANDRAL
Our dearest friend banished, Loki 
on the throne, Asgard on the brink 
of war, yet you manage to consume 
four wild boar, six pheasant, a 
side of beef, and two casks of ale. 
Shame on you! Don't you care?! 
Fandral moves to throw the platter 
in the fire, but Volstagg pulls his 
weapon, stopping him.

VOLSTAGG
Do not mistake my appetite for 
apathy.

SIF
Stop it, both of you! We all know 
what we have to do, we're just too 
damned afraid to do it!

HOGUN
(DECIDES)
We must go. We must find Thor. 
Hogun starts to pull the delicate 
HEALING STONES from the fire, 
carefully putting them into a POUCH 
at his side.

FANDRAL
It's treason, Hogun.

VOLSTAGG
To hell with treason, it's suicide.

(SUDDENLY NERVOUS)
Now, shh! Heimdall may be watching! 
It's said he can hear--

FANDRAL
Yes, yes, we know!

108.


SIF
Thor would do the same for us. An 
EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense.

EINHERJAR GUARD
Heimdall demands your presence. 
Volstagg quickly drains his flagon 
of ale.

VOLSTAGG
We're doomed.

He stands, offers his hand, helps her to her feet.

EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 105

Thor helps Jane down off a ladder. A groggy, hungover Selvig 
emerges from Jane's trailer. He sees Thor with Jane. Selvig 
eyes the two of them together, then:

SELVIG
I need some coffee. The three head 
inside Smith Motors.

FROM THE LIBRARY ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET

SHIELD Agents Garrett and Cale watch the scene, pointing a 
small audio surveillance device towards the lab.

Darcy and Selvig sit at a card table, drinking coffee. Thor 
holds a couple plates as Jane makes eggs on a hotplate. She 
scoops them out onto the plates. Thor takes them over to the 
table, sets them down before Selvig and Darcy.

DARCY
Thanks.

THOR
You're very welcome. Jane joins 
them at the card table with a 
couple more plates.

On a roof across the street from Smith Motors, Agents

their wits. Agent Cale watches the group through the lab 
window with binoculars. Agent Garrett listens to his comm-
link, turns to Cale.

AGENT GARRETT
They want an update.

AGENT CALE
Tell them he's eating eggs.

AGENT GARRETT
Scrambled or fried? Cale glares at 
him.

AGENT CALE

Target is eating eggs, sir. We'll 
keep you posted.

As the group finishes breakfast, Thor looks at the mug in

leaves.

In front of her diner, Isabela prepares to open for the day. 
(Through the window of Isabela's, we see chairs still atop 
tables.) Isabela sweeps the front porch. She looks up to see 
Thor approaching. She eyes him suspiciously. He offers her a 
MUG.

THOR (CONT'D)

110.


THOR
To replace the one I broke. Please 
forgive my behavior.

She takes it, looks at it curiously, then smiles at him.

ISABEL
Okay. Thank you.

THOR
If I may, I'd like to come back for 
more of your "coffee."¬ù

ISABEL
Any time.

He nods and walks away. She stares after him, smiling, and 
shrugs.

ISABEL (CONT'D)
She could do worse.

INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY - DAY 109

Sif and the Warriors Three enter warily to find the 
intimidating Heimdall standing before the Observatory's 
controls. He glares at them accusingly.

VOLSTAGG
Good Heimdall, less us explain--

HEIMDALL
You would defy the commands of Loki 
our King, break every oath you have 
taken as warriors, and commit 
treason to bring Thor back? The 
four exchange nervous glances.

SIF
Yes, but--

HEIMDALL
Good.

The group looks puzzled. What did he just say?

VOLSTAGG
So you'll help us?

HEIMDALL
I am bound by honor to our King. I 
cannot open the Bifrost to you. 
(MORE)

111.


With that, Heimdall leaves them 
alone in the Observatory. The 
others exchange puzzled looks.

FANDRAL
Complicated fellow, isn't he?

VOLSTAGG
Now what do we do? Sif glances at 
the control panel, notices 
something.

SIF
Look!

The others turn to see HEIMDALL'S SWORD stuck into the 
control panel. They exchange a grin. They have an ally. Sif 
hits the controls, and the Bifrost apparatus fires up.

Coulson races in as a SHIELD TECHIE calls up satellite 
footage of the Bifrost storm on a monitor.

COULSON
What the hell was that?

TECHIE
I don't know, sir. We got massive 
energy readings out of nowhere, 
then they just disappeared. Fifteen 
miles due northwest.

COULSON
Let's go take a look.

EXT. BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 111

111

Amidst the fury of the Bifrost storm, the Warriors Three and 
Sif drop to the ground in the New Mexico desert. They 
clamber to their feet as the Bifrost quickly recedes, the 
hole in the sky closing up behind it. The Bifrost runes 
cover the desert sand around them.

VOLSTAGG
He must have landed nearby. It's 
time to put our tracking skills to 
work. Spread out. Check the sand 
for indentations of his boot 
prints.

HEIMDALL (CONT'D)

112.


FANDRAL
The winds would have blown them 
away by now. We should look for 
signs of a campfire.

SIF
Or we could just start there. She 
points behind them to the town of 
Puente Antiguo in the distance -- 
the only visible sign of 
civilization -- and to Hogun, who 
has already started walking towards 
it. Volstagg and Fandral trade 
looks, their egos bruised.

FANDRAL
It's worth a look, I suppose. The 
party tromps towards the town.

EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY 112

Townsfolk stare in wonder at the Warriors Three and Sif, as 
they stroll down the street in all their Asgardian splendor.

EXT. DOWN THE STREET - DAY 113

A BOY Hits a baseball, which rolls under a parked car. He 
runs to retrieve it, but can't reach it. Suddenly, the side 
of the CAR rises into the air. The boy looks over, his mouth 
dropping open at what he sees. Volstagg easily holds the car 
up with one hand.

Volstagg picks up the boy's ball, then drops the car. He 
hands the ball back to the boy, tousling his hair.

VOLSTAGG
There you go, lad! The boy just 
stares, standing frozen. The 
Asgardians head off.

VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Is it just me, or does Earth look a 
little different to you?

SIF
It has been a thousand years...

VOLSTAGG
Things change so fast here. You 
leave for a millennium, and it's 
like the whole neighborhood's gone. 
Volstagg sniffs, smells something.

113.


VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Perhaps we should split up.

Agents Cale and Garrett spot Sif, Fandral, and Hogun walking 
down the street.

AGENT GARRETT
Is there a Renaissance Faire in 
town?

AGENT CALE
Call it in.

But before they can, Volstagg rises up behind them, smashes 
their heads together. They're out.

VOLSTAGG
Never cared for spies. He starts to 
go, then sees their bag of fast 
food on the ground. Intrigued, he 
pulls out a cheeseburger and takes 
a bite. He likes what he tastes.

VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Exquisite.

Loki stands with Gungnir, surveying his kingdom, when an 
Einherjar Guard quickly approaches him, out of breath.

EINHERJAR GUARD
My liege, the Warriors Three and 
the Lady Sif have gone missing. 
Loki reacts. He knows who's 
responsible.

EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - DAY 116
116
116

Loki approaches Heimdall on the Rainbow Bridge.

HEIMDALL
Tell me, Loki, how did you get the 
Jotuns into Asgard?

LOKI
You think the Bifrost is the only 
way in and out of the Realm? There 
are secret paths between worlds to 
which even you with all your gifts 
are blind. But I have need of them 
no longer, now that I am King.

114.


(THEN)
And I say, for your act of treason, 
you are relieved of your duties as 
Gatekeeper. And you are no longer a 
citizen of Asgard.

HEIMDALL
Then I need no longer obey you. 
Heimdall raises his massive sword, 
strides towards Loki. Loki reaches 
out and, with both hands, takes 
hold of something invisible, 
hovering in mid-air before him. As 
it quickly fades into view, we 
realize what it is --

THE CASKET OF ANCIENT WINTERS.

The blueness creeps from his hands and up his arms, as Loki 
opens the Casket towards Heimdall, who is fast approaching. 
From inside the Casket, all hell breaks loose. The fury of 
the Casket is unleashed, its winds not just howling, but 
SCREAMING, as ice and snow and darkness come flying straight 
towards Heimdall. Ice clings to his body, freezing him, but 
still he moves forward. Loki starts to get worried. Heimdall 
is nearly upon him. The Gatekeeper swings his massive sword 
at the prince. But the blade STOPS, frozen, just inches from 
Loki's throat. Loki breathes a sigh of relief and steps past 
him.

Loki inserts Gungnir into the Observatory's control panel 
and opens the Bifrost. He gestures, and the veiled DESTROYER 
appears before him, a fiery glow rising within it. It turns 
its head toward its King.

Jane, Thor, Darcy, and Selvig make a charming team, tidying 
up after breakfast -- washing, drying, and putting plates 
and utensils away. The door opens.

VOLSTAGG (O.S.)
Found you!

Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy turn to see --

115.


SIF AND THE WARRIORS THREE

Staring baffled at the sight of the domestic Thor drying 
dishes in mortal clothing. Jane drops a plate. It goes 
SHATTERING on the floor.

THOR
My friends!

Thor happily races over and greets his comrades. Jane, 
Selvig, and Darcy watch the Asgardians from across the room. 
Jane looks concerned. Selvig and Darcy eye them with wonder.

SELVIG
I don't believe it...

DARCY
Who are they?

VOLSTAGG
Lady Sif and the Warriors Three. 
Surely you've heard tales of Hogun 
the Grim, Fandral the Dashing, and 
I, Volstagg the Svelte? Selvig 
looks pointedly at Volstagg's 
massive gut.

VOLSTAGG (CONT'D)
Well, perhaps I've put on a little 
more muscle since I was here last.

JANE
That would have been a thousand 
years ago? Northern Europe?

VOLSTAGG
Exactly! Those lovely herring 
people. They worshipped us! Thor 
grins, lays a hand on Volstagg's 
shoulder.

THOR
My friends, I've never been happier 
to see anyone. But you should not 
have come.

FANDRAL
We're here to take you home. Jane 
reacts to the news of Thor leaving.

THOR
You know I can't. My father is dead 
because of me. I must remain in 
exile.

The other Asgardians exchange puzzled looks.

SIF
Thor... your father still lives. 
Thor reacts to the revelation.

A few SHIELD vehicles are parked by the Bifrost site. A few 
SHIELD agents stand nearby as SCIENTISTS take readings. 
Coulson kneels, examines the Bifrost Runes. He turns to an 
Agent.

COULSON
Get somebody from Linguistics out 
here.

Just then, they hear a RUMBLING overhead, as the Bifrost 
storm ROARS in the sky above. Coulson and the SHIELD Agents 
scramble for cover, their vehicle windshields SHATTERING, as 
the Bifrost storm grows in strength. Finally, the hole in 
the sky overhead opens, and the funnel cloud EXPLODES out of 
it, touching down onto the desert floor. Coulson and the 
Agents shelter their eyes from the maelstrom.

From behind a jeep, Coulson and the SHIELD AGENTS stare at 
the Destroyer in awe. We don't see it, just its shadow as it 
moves towards them.

SHIELD AGENT
(RE: DESTROYER)
Is that one of Stark's?

COULSON
I don't think so. But the guy 
doesn't tell me anything.

Coulson grabs a megaphone, steps forward, calls out to the 
Destroyer.

117.


COULSON (CONT'D)
Hello! You're using unregistered 
weapons technology. Please identify 
yourself. We hear the HUM of the 
Destroyer's fiery energy power up

As the SHIELD Agents scramble for cover, a blast of energy 
from the Destroyer EXPLODES a vehicle. SHIELD agents return 
fire.

Townspeople fill the streets, staring at the fire fight in

Thor turns to Jane.

THOR
Leave this town now. Get yourself 
and your friends to safety.

JANE
What about you?

THOR
I must stay and fight. The 
Asgardians look to Thor.

THOR (CONT'D)
I'm still a warrior, and I will 
fight by your side.

VOLSTAGG
You're but a mortal now. You'll get 
yourself killed!

FANDRAL
Or one of us, trying to protect 
you.

SIF
The best thing you can do is get 
the mortals to safety and leave the 
battle to us.

Thor looks at the townsfolk around them, all oblivious to 
the oncoming threat.

THOR
(TO SIF)
You're right.

118.


Sif looks surprised. Thor turns to Jane, Selvig, and Darcy.

THOR (CONT'D)
Help me clear the streets. I'll let 
none of these people die this day.

Thor, Jane, Selvig, and Darcy start to herd the crowd of 
Townsfolk off the streets, as the Warriors Three and Sif 
head across town, towards the Destroyer.

Volstagg grins eagerly.

Thor looks anxiously back down the street, where the 
Warriors Three get into position before the Destroyer.

THOR
(TO JANE)
My friends fight bravely, but they 
won't be able to hold it back much 
longer.

Darcy hurries out of the burning pet store carrying as many 
animals in cages as she can, then loads them into a truck.

DOWN THE STREET

Hogun and Fandral take off running towards the Destroyer, as 
Volstagg stands limbering up.

FANDRAL
(TO VOLSTAGG)
Come on!

Volstagg takes off running at full speed. As he catches up 
to his comrades, Hogun and Fandral grab him on either side, 
and with all their Asgardian might, hurl the voluminous 
warrior into the air at the black metal behemoth.

VOLSTAGG
For Asgaaaaard!!!

120.


The Destroyer is unable to react quickly enough, as Volstagg 
SMASHES into the creature. It looks like it might actually 
work for a moment, but the Destroyer stays on its feet. It 
lifts Volstagg into the by the scruff of his neck. He shrugs 
apologetically. The Destroyer savagely HURLS him at Hogun 
and Fandral, smashing into them, when --

SIF
Leaps off a nearby rooftop with her 
two-headed spear and plunges it 
deep into the back of the creature. 
The creature stands there 
motionless, the fire dimming in its 
faceplate, Sif standing atop its 
back. The Asgardians have a brief 
moment of hope. But the creature 
stirs with life, its fire igniting 
once again. Sif looks on with 
growing trepidation. Slowly, 
unnaturally, the Destroyer spins 
its torso around 180 degrees to 
face its attackers. The Destroyer 
unleashes a blast at Sif. She 
barely dives off of the behemoth in 
time, dodging the blast. The 
Destroyer rises again to its full 
height, pulling free from Sif's 
staff, the weapon slipping through 
the slats of its armor. Sif and the 
Warriors Three try to regroup, when 
the Destroyer unleashes another 
blast, sending Sif and her comrades 
flying in all directions. Hogun's 
POUCH OF HEALING STONES breaks 
free, landing in the middle of the 
street.

EXT. SMITH MOTORS - DAY 131

Thor sees his friends lying injured on the ground, but has 
no time to act, as the Destroyer fires in his direction. A 
storefront near Smith Motor EXPLODES, knocking Thor, Jane, 
and Selvig off their feet. Thor helps Jane to her feet, when 
they notice Selvig lying on his back amidst the debris, 
impaled by a twisted piece of iron.

JANE
Erik!

She and Thor hurry to his side. He's losing blood, going 
into shock.

121.


SELVIG
(TO JANE)
Go! Leave me!

Jane takes his hand as Thor spots Hogun's pouch of healing 
stones lying in the middle of the street. He makes a break 
for it, dodging through the flaming wreckage, then grabs the 
pouch and races back. He opens the pouch to find the fragile 
stones crushed and useless. He pours the contents out in his 
hand.

THOR
Come on... give me one! Amidst the 
useless powder, he finally finds 
one stone still intact. Thor tosses 
the pouch aside, holds the stone 
over the end of the iron rod.

JANE
What are you doing? What is that? 
As the stone begins to glow, Thor 
crushes it. Jane looks on, amazed, 
as the glowing powder falls upon 
the piece of iron, dissolving it, 
heading downwards, until it reaches 
Selvig's wound. The powder heals 
his wound completely.

Thor looks down the street, sees his wounded friends still 
lying there, as Selvig sits up in utter astonishment. He 
reaches through the hole in his shirt to touch his healed 
flesh.

SELVIG
(to Jane, re: Thor)
I'm really starting to like him. 
Jane turns to Thor to find he's 
gone.

EXT. DOWN THE STREET 132

Thor reaches Sif, who lies dazed, battered, and bloodied on 
the ground. He pulls her behind a burning vehicle.

THOR
Go, while you can!

SIF
But the others...

THOR
You can't help them now. Your job 
is to survive.

122.


She struggles to sit up.

SIF
No! I will die a warrior's death. 
Stories will be told of this day-- 
He gently takes her shield from 
her.

THOR
Live and tell those stories 
yourself.

At last, she nods. Thor spots Volstagg lying unconscious, 
with Hogun and Fandral lying nearby. Thor makes his way 
towards them. Volstagg is barely breathing. Thor tries to 
pull him to safety, but it's no use. He won't budge. He 
rouses Hogun and Fandral.

THOR (CONT'D)
(RE: VOLSTAGG)
Get him out of here!

FANDRAL
No. We can still fight!

THOR
But not win. Move Volstagg, or 
he'll die!

Thor looks at them, grins.

THOR (CONT'D)
Don't worry, my friends. I have a 
plan.

The two Warriors reluctantly grab their fallen friend and 
drag him away from the battlefield. After they go, Thor 
turns to back to the Destroyer, then tosses Sif's shield 
aside. He strides down the street towards the behemoth, 
completely defenseless.

THOR (CONT'D)
Brother... for whatever I have done 
to wrong you, whatever I have done 
to lead you to do this, I am sorry. 
But these people have done nothing 
to you. They are innocents. He 
continues towards the Destroyer.

THOR (CONT'D)
Take my life, and know I will never 
return to Asgard.

123.


Thor reaches the Destroyer, extends his arms. The Destroyer 
hesitates, sizing up the defenseless Thor, then swats him 
with its enormous arm. We hear the sickening CRACK of 
breaking bones as Thor goes flying. Thor lands in a 
crumpled, broken heap in front of Smith Motors, before Jane, 
Selvig, and Darcy. The wounded Asgardians watch helplessly 
from down the street, a look of horror on their faces. Jane 
tries to rush out to Thor's aid, but Selvig holds her back.

SELVIG
Jane, no!

He pulls her into Smith Motors. A RAVEN flies overhead, 
watching the scene --

unleash its fiery blast.

Inside the crater, the RUNES of the side of Mjolnir 
reappear, burning bright. Electricity starts to CRACKLE on 
the hammer's surface. SCIENTISTS beside it take notice as it 
vibrates, and a RUMBLE comes from overhead. They look up. 
Clouds form in the sky above. Just then, with a CRACK and 
flash of lightning, Mjolnir flies straight up into the air 
like a rocket.

EXT. MAIN STREET 136

The Destroyer unleashes its blast at Thor's body, when --

KRAKAKABOOM!

A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, 
colliding with the Destroyer's blast. The explosion is 
massive. The Destroyer is hurled backwards, a cloud of dust 
enveloping the street. As the smoke clears we see --

JANE
Oh. My. God.

124.


THE MIGHTY THOR

Clad in his full battle armor, holding Mjolnir in his hand -- 
the God of Thunder once more. Thor kneels, brings Mjolnir 
down onto the ground.

KRAKABOOM!

Lightning strikes the Destroyer. It convulses. Thor swings 
Mjolnir around, takes off straight up into the air, as the 
Destroyer gets back on its feet and looks up at the Thunder 
God. Storm clouds gather around Thor as he summons gale 
force winds. Debris from the battle begins to rise up into 
the sky. The Destroyer stays there, kept grounded by its 
massive weight.

It lifts its head up at the Thunder God, opens its 
faceplate, locks it in place, unleashes its blast. Thor 
dives downwards straight at it, with Mjolnir before him. 
Mjolnir collides with the Destroyer's fiery energy blast, 
overpowering it, pushing it back, forcing it downwards at 
the Destroyer. Thor jams his hammer deep into the 
Destroyer's faceplate. The fiery energy within the creature 
builds up and EXPLODES within him, firing out of all his 
openings. Thor smashes the Destroyer to the ground in a 
tremendous heap, the fiery energy within it extinguished 
forever. Thor pulls Mjolnir from its faceplate, walks away 
from its lifeless carcass. As he does, the other objects and 
debris pulled into the air by the gale winds drop down from 
the skies, around the Destroyer, burying it. Jane and Thor's 
comrades, now roused, stand to join him. A battered Coulson 
approaches with several SHIELD AGENTS.

COULSON

completely honest with me.

looks to Darcy, turns on the charm.

FANDRAL (CONT'D)

Darcy enjoys the attention.

Thor shouts back up to the sky.

THOR

From inside the ice, Heimdall hears Thor calling to him. 
Knowing that the fate of Asgard depends on him, he musters 
all his strength. The ice around him begins to CRACK. With a 
tremendous effort, Heimdall SHATTERS free from the ice. 
Weakened, near death, he drags himself inside the 
Observatory.

The Asgardians begin to lose hope. Volstagg eyes a SHIELD

VOLSTAGG

small game, I suppose. Suddenly, 
the Bifrost EXPLODES down from the 
sky. Thor grins. The mortals look 
on, amazed. Fandral turns to Darcy.

126.


FANDRAL
Sorry, my love. These things 
happen.

He joins the other Asgardians at their side. Thor turns to 
Coulson.

THOR
Know this, son of Coul. You and I, 
we fight for the same cause -- the 
protection of this world. From this 
day forward, count me as your ally.

(THEN)
If you return the items you have 
stolen from Jane Foster.

COULSON
Not stolen. Borrowed. Jane shoots 
him a look. Coulson quickly 
continues.

COULSON (CONT'D)
You'll get your equipment back. 
You're going to need it to continue 
your research... which, after 
today's events, SHIELD would like 
to fully sponsor. If that's all 
right with you.

Thor takes Jane's hand, kisses it tenderly. She looks at 
him, her eyes filled with the fear that she may never see 
him again.

THOR
Whatever fate lies before me, you 
are part of it.

He takes her in his arms, kisses her passionately. Thor and 
the Asgardians leap into the Bifrost.

It's said you can still see and

death came by the hand of Laufey. 
He raises his blade above Odin's 
body, when --

A BLAST OF ENERGY

Hits him from behind. As the Jotun king falls to the ground, 
we see it is not Thor standing behind him, but Loki, holding 
Gungnir.

LOKI
And your death came by the son of 
Odin.

Laufey dies as the other two shocked Frost Giants move for 
Loki. He fires Gungnir at one, blasting him against a wall, 
taking him out.

The Brute is nearly upon him, when the Jotun stops suddenly, 
his eyes going wide. The Brute falls to the ground,

FRIGGA
Standing behind him -- the sword 
stuck in his back. She looks to 
Loki, takes him in her arms.

LOKI
I swear to you, mother, they will

will end the Jotun threat, now and 
forever!

He looks to Odin.

LOKI (CONT'D)
And I will make you proud. Loki 
savors the moment, but it's short-
lived, as Thor bursts in. He's 
thrown by the scene before him -- 
Odin safe, Laufey and two Jotuns 
dead, Frigga regarding Loki with 
pride and respect. Stunned and 
delighted to see Thor, Frigga 
beams.

FRIGGA
Thor!

She moves to Thor and hugs him, but Thor's eyes remain fixed 
on his brother. Loki looks at Mjolnir in his brother's hand.

LOKI
Found its way back to you, did it?

THOR
No thanks to you. Frigga picks up 
on the tension building between her 
sons.

FRIGGA
What?

THOR
Why don't you tell her? How you 
sent the Destroyer to kill our 
friends? To kill me? Frigga looks 
to Loki, alarmed and confused.

LOKI
It must have been enforcing 
Father's last command.

You're a talented liar, brother. 
Always have been.

LOKI
(SMILES)
It's good to have you back.

Thor enters, shields his eyes from the brilliant light of 
the Bifrost energy blasting towards Jotunheim.

He looks over to the controls, sees that they're frozen in 
an enormous block of ice. Loki stands atop it.

LOKI
All these years, and no one's ever 
dared to use it as a weapon. Thor 
hurries to the ice, raises his 
hammer to SMASH through it to get 
to the controls frozen within. 
Before he can, Loki fires Gungnir. 
The blast hits the ice in front of 
Thor, blasting him back across the 
floor. Loki steps down from the ice 
as Thor staggers to his feet.

LOKI (CONT'D)
You can't stop it. The Bifrost will 
build until it rips Jotunheim 
apart.

THOR
Why have you done this?

LOKI
To do what Father never could. To 
destroy their kind forever. When he 
awakens, he'll see the wisdom of 
what I've done.

THOR
He won't! You can't kill an entire 
race!

LOKI
What is this newfound love for the 
Frost Giants? You, who would have 
killed them all with your bare 
hands.

THOR
I've changed.

LOKI
So have I.

Loki hits Thor across the face with Gungnir.

LOKI (CONT'D)
Fight me.

131.


He swings Gungnir at Thor again. Thor catches it in his 
hand, rears back his hammer as if ready to return the blow, 
but instead takes to the air and flies past Loki, back 
towards the frozen controls. Loki spins around, aims 
Gungnir, and fires a blast which immobilizes Thor in the 
air. He hangs there, suspended.

THOR
Is the throne really worth what 
you've done? What you would become?

LOKI
I never wanted the throne. I only 
wanted to be your equal. Now fight 
me!

With a gesture of Gungnir, he flings Thor to the ground. 
Thor rises to his feet, turns to Loki.

THOR
I will not fight you, brother.

LOKI
I am not your brother. I never was.

THOR
Loki, this is madness... Loki 
grins.

LOKI
Is it?

He FIRES Gungnir at Thor. Thor dodges the blast, rolls to 
his feet.

LOKI (CONT'D)
What happened to you on earth that 
turned you so soft? Don't tell me 
it was a woman.

Thor doesn't answer. Loki laughs, realizing he's right.

LOKI (CONT'D)
It was. Perhaps when we're finished 
here I'll pay her a little visit 
myself.

That did it. Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and 
their weapons collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing 
years of pent-up rage and jealousy, Thor having no choice 
but to defend himself.

Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson look up with concern at the 
hole in the sky, where excess Bifrost energy builds up 
around it.

SELVIG
Jane?

JANE
Something's wrong.

INT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 157

157

Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires Gungnir, sending 
Thor sliding across the floor and knocking Mjolnir from his 
hand. The hammer flies into the Bifrost towards Jotunheim. 
Thor raises his hand towards his hammer, tries to summon it 
back to him, to keep it in this Realm, but the Bifrost is 
too powerful. Mjolnir disappears into the maelstrom as Thor 
himself slides towards the Bifrost.

LOKI
If you care so much for the Jotuns, 
then die with them. The Bifrost 
stretches every cell of Thor's 
body, trying to drag him away. He's 
nearly swallowed by the vortex, 
when he concentrates, mustering his 
will. He reaches out his hand 
towards the Bifrost. MJOLNIR flies 
back through the maelstrom, into 
Thor's hand. The hammer pulls him 
free. Loki tries to fire off 
another blast at him, but Thor 
takes to the air, speeds towards 
his brother.

EXT. HEIMDALL'S OBSERVATORY 158

Thor and Loki come CRASHING through the Observatory dome and 
land hard, rolling across the Rainbow Bridge. As Thor gets 
to his feet, he sees Loki dangling off the Bridge's edge.

LOKI
Thor! Help me!

133.


Thor steps over to the side of the Bridge, sees Loki looking 
up at him desperately.

LOKI (CONT'D)
Please...

Loki's fingers start to slip. Thor reaches down to grab his 
brother's wrist, but his hand passes through Loki's. Just 
then, the REAL LOKI materializes behind him. Thor whirls 
around as Loki STABS him in the chest with Gungnir. Loki 
lifts Thor into the air, impaled on the spear, and hurls him 
across the bridge.

Thor, bleeding, rises to his knees. Loki strides up behind 
him to finish him off, when Thor swing his hammer around. It 
passes through him. Instantly, another Loki appears next to 
him, Thor swings his hammer, but that too is an illusion. 
Loki after Loki appears, Thor futilely swinging at each one, 
never making contact. Thor falls back to his knees. The 
Lokis grin as their raises their spears, encircling him.

LOKIS
I was always more clever than you.

THOR
Yet still not clever enough. With 
that, Thor raises his hammer, 
rising into the air, summoning 
lightning. A massive bolt strikes 
Mjolnir, then channels outwards, 
splitting up, striking each one of 
the Lokis.

All of them dissipate into nothingness, save one -- the real 
Loki -- who's sent flying back across the Bridge, Gungnir 
knocked from his grasp. Thor steps over to his fallen 
brother, lying dazed on his back. Loki winces, prepares for 
the worst, when Thor steps away. Loki opens his eyes, tries 
to stand, but can't. He looks confused, then sees what the 
problem is -- Mjolnir rests atop his chest. Struggle as he 
may, Loki can't lift it off. He's pinned to the ground. Thor 
looks about him desperately -- at the Bifrost firing towards 
Jotunheim, gaining in strength, at the surge of energy 
moving through the Bridge. He's at a loss of what to do. 
Loki watches him smugly.

LOKI
Look at you, the Mighty Thor. With 
all your strength, what good does 
it do you now? Thor knows Loki's 
right. He's powerless to stop 
what's happening. 
(MORE)

134.


He looks down at the Bridge beneath 
his feet, VIBRATING from the force 
and speed of the Bifrost energy 
feeding into the Observatory. Then 
he gets an idea. He realizes what 
he must do -- and what he must 
sacrifice. Thor extends his hand 
towards Loki, summoning Mjolnir. 
The hammer goes flying to his 
grasp. Loki looks confused.

Thor raises Mjolnir in the air. Clouds form above him, 
thunder RUMBLING. Lightning arcs off of his hammer, as he 
channels the power of the storm into it, then -- He strikes 
Mjolnir down upon the Rainbow Bridge. The blow is massive, 
causing a rumbling along the whole bridge, shaking the 
Observatory itself like an earthquake. A crack appears where 
the blow struck. Loki rises to his feet.

LOKI (CONT'D)
Stop! What are you doing?! Thor 
lifts the hammer again, brings it 
down harder. BOOM! The crack grows 
bigger. The Bifrost energy starts 
to stream out from it. Loki thinks 
fast.

LOKI (CONT'D)
If you destroy the Bridge, you'll 
never see her again! Loki grabs 
Gungnir, runs towards him, ready to 
pierce Thor through the back.

THOR
Forgive me.

Summoning every bit of strength he has left, Thor raises 
Mjolnir one last time, drawing lightning to it from all 
sides, and brings it down with a final, terrible blow -- 
KRAKABOOM! The Bifrost SHATTERS, rainbow energy EXPLODING 
out of it. Both Loki and Thor are hurled into the air by the 
force of the blast. A wave of destruction moves forward 
along the Bridge towards the Observatory, breaking it apart 
as it goes. The Observatory RIPS ITSELF APART. As Loki and 
Thor fall together, Thor grabs hold of one end of Gungnir, 
while Loki still clutches the other. They both fall towards 
the MASSIVE WAVE of Bifrost energy which spews out from the 
broken Bridge. They're an instant from being blasted by the 
destructive force of the energy, carried away by the 
current, pulverized by the debris, when --

LOKI (CONT'D)

135.


A POWERFUL HAND

Catches Thor's leg. Thor dangles there, holding onto Gungnir 
as Loki hangs onto the other end. Loki looks up, shocked to

SEE --

ODIN ALLFATHER
Standing on the edge of the broken 
Bridge, awakened from the 
Odinsleep, restored to his full 
strength. Loki searches his 
father's face, looking for some 
kind of approval, some kind of 
redemption, but all he sees is 
disappointment and regret. Loki 
lets go.

THOR
No!

But it's too late. Odin and Thor can only watch as Loki 
falls into the rushing torrent of Bifrost energy. It carries 
him away, along with the debris of the Bridge and the 
Observatory, disappearing out of sight. Odin pulls Thor up 
onto the Bridge. Drained, Thor falls back into his father's 
arms.

ODIN
It is over.

BIFROST LANDING SITE (EARTH) - DAY 159

159

The Bifrost energy explodes in the sky like fireworks firing 
in all directions. Jane, Selvig, Darcy, and Coulson stand 
watching in amazement. Jane looks back up at the sky, 
distraught. She knows the significance of what's just 
happened.

JANE
It's gone.

INT. ODIN'S PALACE - BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 160
160
160

A FEAST is in progress as Thor, Sif, and the Warriors Three 
sit amongst the gathered Asgardians. Hogun sits between 
Fandral and Volstagg, who is in the middle of recounting 
their battle with the Destroyer.

VOLSTAGG
...and then, with a mighty bellow, 
I flew at the great metal beast and 
laid it low...

136.


FANDRAL
Is that another way of saying you 
fell on your huge a--

VOLSTAGG
As a matter of fact, falling down 
was a tactic. Lulling the Destroyer 
into a false sense of security!

FANDRAL
Well, I was the one who had to drag 
your enormous carcass off the 
battlefield. That makes me the real 
hero. Doesn't it, Hogun? Hogun 
points to Volstagg.

HOGUN
Big stomach.
(points to Fandral)
Big mouth.

The other gathered Asgardians laugh. Volstagg and Fandral 
look to Hogun. The grim warrior gives just a trace of a 
smile.

FANDRAL
Well, how about that? A smile! I'd 
say that calls for another drink!

They laugh and raise another round. Frigga sits nearby, lost 
in thought, her face betraying the sadness she struggles to 
conceal. Sif notices, approaches Frigga, bows her head.

SIF
My Queen. I am so sorry for your 
loss.

Frigga takes Sif's hand appreciatively.

FRIGGA
Thank you, Sif.

She looks to Thor, who's unable to enjoy the merriment 
around him.

FRIGGA (CONT'D)
How is he?

SIF
He mourns for his brother. And he 
misses her. The mortal. 
(MORE)

137.


Frigga sees the trace of regret in 
Sif's face as she looks at Thor 
with new feelings. He rises and 
leaves the hall.

FRIGGA
He will need his friends now more 
than ever.

SIF
I will always be at his side. 
Frigga understands, puts her arm 
around Sif gratefully.

EXT. PALACE BALCONY - NIGHT 161

161

Thor stands alone on the balcony, lost in thought. Odin 
walks up behind him.

ODIN
You'll be a wise King.

THOR
There will never be a wiser king 
than you. Or a better father.

(THEN)
I have much to learn. I know that 
now. But some day, perhaps, I will 
make you proud.

ODIN
You've already made me proud. Odin 
leaves, Thor consoled by his words.

EXT. RAINBOW BRIDGE - NIGHT 162
162
162

Out of the broken, jagged Rainbow Bridge flows the Bifrost 
energy, drifting off into space. Thor walks out to its edge, 
where Heimdall stands watch. Thor stares out at the stellar 
void.

THOR
Can you see her? Heimdall turns, 
gazes out towards Earth.

HEIMDALL
Yes.

THOR
How is she?

SIF (CONT'D)

EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - NIGHT 163
163
163

Through the window into Jane's lab, we see an enlarged 
ILLUSTRATION from her notebook pinned to a board. As we pull 
away, we see a computer terminal displaying a program 
clearly inspired by the illustration. We pull further back 
to see that the lab has been transformed into a well-funded 
research facility, abuzz with activity. SHIELD SCIENTISTS 
and AGENTS work with impressive, state-of- the-art 
equipment. Selvig orchestrates the process, giving 
instructions to the SCIENTISTS. We continue to track right 
outside the glass windows and rise up to find Jane sitting 
at the front of the roof, working at a small, improvised 
workstation, notebook at hand, as always. She sets up an 
impressive, HIGH-TECH DEVICE before her, which bears the 
"STARK INDUSTRIES"¬ù logo. From behind, Darcy approaches, 
hands her a flash drive.

DARCY
Here you go.

JANE
Thanks.

Jane inserts the flash drive into the device.

DARCY
He would have come back if he 
could.

JANE
I know. But if he can't get here on 
his own...

Jane hits a switch on the device. Suddenly, a 3-D 
HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION bursts to life over the device, 
bathing the two women in its glow. We recognize what it is -- 
YGGDRASIL, in all its beauty.

JANE (CONT'D)
...maybe we can help him find his 
way back.

FADE OUT:

THE END

139.


Odin: [voice over] Long before the birth of light there was darkness, and from that darkness, came the Dark Elves. Millennia ago, the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith, sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night.
[Malekith is looking up at the Convergence]
Odin: Such evil was possible through the power of the Aether, an ancient force of infinite destruction.
[the Aether is shown]
Odin: The noble armies of Asgard, led by my father, King Bor, waged a mighty war against these creatures.
[the Dark Elves and Asgardians are shown fighting]
[Kurse walks up to Malekith]
Kurse: [subtitled] Malekith! Asgard's forces are upon us.
[the Bifrost opens, and bor steps out with Asgardian reinforcements]
Malekith: Send the Kursed.
[some soldiers crush objects in their hands and become giant hulk-like creatures]
[Malekith looks up at the Convergence again]
Odin: As the Nine Worlds converged above him, Malekith could at last unleash the Aether...
[Malekith and Kurse walk up to the Aether]
[however, the Bifrost opens and Asgardian warriors attack Malekith, whom he kills]
[the Bifrost disappears, just as Malekith tries to get the Aether, but it is no longer there]
Odin: But Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp. Without it, the Dark Elves fell. With the battle all but lost, Malekith sacrificed his own people in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard's army.
[Malekith watches as his forces are slaughtered]
Malekith: [subtitled] Their deaths will mean our survival. This war is far from over.
[he and Kurse get onto his ship and escape without notice, while destroying the other ships in the process]
[the ships kill some of the Asgardians]
Odin: Malekith was vanquished, and the Aether was no more. Or so we were led to believe.
Asgardian Einherjar: Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?
Bor: If only we could. But its power is too great. Bury it deep. Somewhere no one will ever find it.
[Asgard – Throne Room. Loki, in chains, is brought to Odin.]
Frigga: Loki.
Loki: Hello, mother. Have I made you proud?
Frigga: Please, don't make this worse.
Loki: Define worse.
Odin: Enough! I will speak to the prisoner alone.
[Frigga leaves.]
Loki: [laughs] I really don't see what all the fuss is about.
Odin: Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death.
Loki: I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent god. Just like you.
Odin: We are not gods. We are born, we live, we die. Just as humans do.
Loki: Give or take 5000 years.
Odin: All this because Loki desires a throne.
Loki: It is my birthright.
Odin: Your birthright was to die as a child. Cast out onto a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in you would not be here now to hate me.
Loki: If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't love our little talks, it's just ... I don't love them.
Odin: Frigga is the only reason you are still alive and you will never see her again. You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.
Loki: And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains?
Odin: Thor must strife to undo the damage you have done. He will bring order to the nine realms and then, yes. He will be king.
[Cut to Vanaheim]
[Sif, the Warriors Three and Thor are fighting in a battle.]
Sif: I've got this completely under control!
Thor: Is that why everything is on fire?
[Sif catches an arrow that was aimed at Thor with her shield.]
Sif: You're welcome. [a Kronan arrives] All yours.
Thor: Hello. [the Kronan growls] I accept your surrender.
[The soldiers laugh. Thor swings his hammer and crushes the Kronan.]
Thor: Anyone else?
[The soldiers surrender.]
Fandral: Perhaps next time we should start with the big one.
Guard: Keep moving. Come on! Keep moving. Go ahead of me. Don't you turn around!
Hogun: Where do we go next?
Thor: Hogun, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms. You should stay here. Be with your people, where your heart is. Asgard can wait.
Hogun: You have my thanks.
Thor: As you have mine. Heimdall, when you're ready.
[Cut to Asgard]
Odin: Is Vanaheim secure?
Thor: As are Nornheim and Ria. Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore.
Odin: You must think I'm a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily.
Thor: That was not my intent.
Odin: For the first time since the Bifrost was destroyed, the Nine Realms are at peace. They're well reminded of our strength and you have earned their respect and my gratitude.
Thor: Thank you.
Odin: Nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart.
Thor: This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.
Odin: Human lives are fleeting, they are nothing. You'd be better served by what lies in front of you [Camera briefly turns to Sif] I'm telling you this not as the all-father but as your father. You are ready. The time has come for you to take the throne. Embrace and celebrate what you've won. Join your warriors. Eat and drink, revel in their celebration. At least pretend to enjoy yourself.
[and as they celebrate, as he watches the others enjoying themselves it's obvious his heart is not in it, he walks over to the balcony to join Sif]
Sif: There was a time you would celebrate for weeks.
Thor: I remember you celebrated the battle of Haragon so much that you nearly started a second.
Sif: Well, the first was so much fun.
[they both smile]
Sif: Take a drink with me. Surely the All-Father could have no further task for you tonight.
Thor: No, this is one I set myself.
Sif: It has not gone unnoticed that you disappear each night. There are Nine Realms. Future king of Asgard must focus on more than one.
Thor: I thank you for your sword and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.
[he turns and walks off]
[in London Jane is on a date with a man named Richard, Jane is looking at her menu feeling awkward when Richard slides a napkin in front of her with the word 'Hi' written on it]
Richard: Hi.
Jane Foster: Hi.
Richard: So what's the story with you?
Jane Foster: Why does there have to be a story, there's no story.
Richard: You've spent the first ten minutes of our date hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it. It's either chicken, vegetarian or fish, Jane. I think there's a story and I'm thinking the story involves a guy?
Jane Foster: It's complicated.
Richard: Is he still around?
Jane Foster: No, he...went away.
Richard: I've been there. The going away, it's hard. I'd been seeing a woman and uh...she took a job in New York, eventually the distance killed it. And...and the fact that she uh...she kept sleeping with other dudes.
Jane Foster: No!
Richard: Oh, so many.
[Darcy walks up to Jane and Richard's table]
Richard: Hi. Um...could we get some wine please?
Darcy Lewis: Sure, I'd love some.
Jane Foster: Richard, this is Darcy. [to Darcy] What are you doing here?
[Darcy grabs a chair from the opposite table and drags it across to their table]
Richard: Oh, hello.
[Darcy sits next to Jane and helps herself to a piece of bread and starts buttering it]
Darcy Lewis: So, I show up to work at the lab-slash-your mom's house, fully expecting you to be moping around in your pajamas eating ice cream obsessing about you know who...
Richard: Ah.
Darcy Lewis: But you're not! You're wearing lady clothes, you even showered, didn't you? You smell good.
Jane Foster: Is there a point to all this, cause there really has to be a point to all this.
Darcy Lewis: Right. You know that scientific equipment you don't look at anymore? You might wanna start looking at it now
[she gives Jane the gadget]
Darcy Lewis: This is the reason we came all the way out here.
Jane Foster: It's malfunctioning.
Darcy Lewis: That's what I said.
[Jane starts hitting the gadget on the table]
Darcy Lewis: That's what I did! But you just hit a little more scientific.
Jane Foster: I'm sure it's nothing.
Richard: Yeah.
[Jane hands the gadget back to Darcy]
Darcy Lewis: It didn't look like nothing. Kind of looks like the readings that Erik was rambling about. [to Richard] Our friend Erik, kind of went banana-balls.
Jane Foster: He's not interested. I'm not interested. Time for you to go now.
Darcy Lewis: Okay.
[Jane rises and drags her chair back to where she got it from, then turns and walks off]
Richard: Short but sweet.
Jane Foster: She needs help.
[they start looking at their menus again, but Jane looks distracted by what Darcy told her]
Richard: I think I'm gonna have the sea bass.
Jane Foster: Sea bass. Yeah, sea bass is good.
[to herself as she thinks about what Darcy showed her]
Jane Foster: Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass...sea bass. Sea bass...
Richard: Jane, maybe you should stop saying sea bass and go out to your friend.
[Jane looks at him awkwardly]
Jane Foster: This was so fun.
Richard: You know, I'll just stay here and say sea bass alone.
[Jane enters Darcy's car parked outside the restaurant]
Jane Foster: And I hate you.
Darcy Lewis: What?! I thought he was cute.
Jane Foster: Just shut up and drive.
[Darcy pulls out and drive off, as they are driving through London suddenly Jane's is shocked to see a guy sat in the back seat]
Jane Foster: Who's he?
Darcy Lewis: He's my intern.
Jane Foster: You have an intern?
Darcy Lewis: Oh, yeah.
Ian Boothby: Hello, Dr. Foster. It's uh...it's a great honor to be working with you.
Jane Foster: Right. I have to call Erik.
[to Darcy as he checks the navigator]
Ian Boothby: Oh, uh...take a right.
[Darcy quickly makes a sharp turn]
Ian Boothby: Left!
[she then turns quickly left]
Darcy Lewis: I have totally mastered driving in London.
[Jane calls Erik and leaves a message]
Jane Foster: Hi, Erik, it's me again. Where are you? I came here because you said you were onto something and then vanished.
[a news report is then shown where Selvig is naked and running around Stonehenge while the police try to catch him]
Stonehenge TV News Reporter: I'm here at Stonehenge, for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today. The police reported the scene shortly after 11 a.m. this morning, after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area then started to strip naked and effectively terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment while shouting that he was trying to save them. The man later identified as noted Astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig has been called in for questioning by police.
[Darcy pulls up outside an old abandoned factory and they all get out of the car]
Darcy Lewis: Come on, this is exciting! Look, the intern is excited.
Ian Boothby: Ian.
Darcy Lewis: Do you want the phase meter?
Jane Foster: No.
Darcy Lewis: [to Ian] Bring the phase meter.
[she throws the car keys at Ian and starts walking off]
Darcy Lewis: The toaster looking thing.
Ian Boothby: I know what the phase meter is.
[as Jane walks towards the factory Darcy calls her on her cell phone which starts playing an annoying music tone]
Jane Foster: How do I change the ring tone on this thing?
Darcy Lewis: An Astrophysicist with three degrees should be able to change her own ring tone.
[Jane turns to look at Darcy]
Jane Foster: Why are you calling me?
Darcy Lewis: I didn't want to shout. [to Ian, who's following behind her] Intern, the entrance is this way.
Ian Boothby: Ian. My name's Ian.
[as they enter the old factory they hear a noise]
Darcy Lewis: I am not getting stabbed in the name of science.
[she holds up her hands and shouts]
Darcy Lewis: It's okay, we're Americans!
Jane Foster: Is that supposed to make them like us?
[suddenly the hear some kids voices]
Maddie: Make it go away...
Navid: Ssh!
[three kids come out of their hiding place]
Jane Foster: Oh, they're kids.
Maddie: Are you the police?
Jane Foster: No, we're scientists. Well, I am.
Darcy Lewis: Thanks.
Navid: We just found it.
Jane Foster: Can you show us?
[the three kids lead Jane, Darcy and Ian to a truck, one of the boys touches the truck and pushes it up with two fingers, they watch in amazement as the truck floats in mid-air]
Darcy Lewis: That doesn't seem rigged.
[the kids then take them to a stairwell in the factory, one of them drops a bottle down and they watch as the bottle disappears into thin air]
Darcy Lewis: Where did it go?
[the girl points her finger up, they look up to see the bottle reappear above them and continuously fall and disappear in the same spots in the air]
Darcy Lewis: That's...that's incredible.
[Jane picks up an empty can and drops it down and it does the same thing, it disappears into thin air, but when they look up to watch it reappear nothing happens]
Darcy Lewis: What happened?
Maddie: Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't.
Darcy Lewis: I want to throw something. Jane, give me your shoe.
[Jane picks up her gadget to look at the readings]
Jane Foster: I haven't seen readings like this since...
Darcy Lewis: New Mexico?
[Jane give Darcy a meaningful look before rushing off]
Jane Foster: Don't touch anything!
Darcy Lewis: [to Ian] Give me your shoe.
[Jane walks away from the others and watches them on the stairwell dropping objects down and watching them disappear and reappear, she sees looks at her gadget and sees the anomaly is nearby and starts walking off; back on the stairwell, Ian drops the car keys down and they watch it disappear but when they look up it doesn't reappear]
Darcy Lewis: Where those the car keys?
[Jane follows the readings on her gadget which takes her to another part of the factory, as the readings get stronger a gust of wind pushes her forward and she finds herself teleported in another realm]
Jane Foster: Darcy!
[she looks around and finds the column holding the Aether, she reaches her hand out and suddenly the Aether enters her body and she passes out; at the same time we see Malekith being awakened in his ship, knowing that the Aether has been found]
Malekith: [subtitled] The Aether awakens us. The Convergence returns.
[back in Asgard, Thor walks up the bridge towards Heimdall]
Heimdall: You're late.
Thor: Merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle.
Heimdall: Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.
[Thor chuckles]
Thor: Perhaps. How fare the stars?
Heimdall: Still shining. From here I can see Nine Realms and ten trillion souls.
[Heimdall looks at Thor for a moment]
Heimdall: You recall what I told you of the Convergence?
Thor: Yes, the alignment of the worlds. It approaches, doesn't it?
Heimdall: The universe hasn't seen this marvel since before my watch began. Few can sense, even fewer can see it. A world that's infected can be dangerous. It is truly beautiful.
[they looks out into the stars]
Thor: I see nothing.
Heimdall: Or perhaps that is not the beauty you seek.
[Thor laughs]
Thor: How is she?
Heimdall: She's quite clever, your mortal. She doesn't know it yet, but she studies the Convergence as well. Even...
[Heimdall stops as he senses something]
Thor: What?
Heimdall: I can't see her.
[we see Jane being infected by the Aether] [after Jane is infected with the Aether she reawakens in the factory, she runs out to find Darcy has called the police]
Darcy Lewis: Jane! Where the hell were you?
Jane Foster: Tell me you didn't call the police!
Darcy Lewis: What was I supposed to do?
Jane Foster: Not call the police!
Darcy Lewis: I was freaking out.
Jane Foster: You call the cops they tell the feds, the next thing you know we have SHIELD crawling all over area fifty-one-ing the place.
Darcy Lewis: Jane!
Jane Foster: We had a stable gratification anomaly, we had unheeded access. Our only competition was ten years old!
Darcy Lewis: Jane, you were gone for five hours!
Jane Foster: What? [suddenly the weather turns, it starts raining and they hear the sound of thunder, Jane looks around her and puts her hand out]
Darcy Lewis: That's weird. [they see it's raining but it's not raining on Jane and Darcy, there's an invisible barrier protecting them, suddenly Jane sees Thor standing a few feet away from them, Jane hands her gadget to Darcy and walks towards Thor, as she walks away the invisible barrier follows her and the rain starts falling on Darcy] Typical. [as Jane walks towards Thor]
Thor: Jane. [as she reaches him suddenly she slaps him hard in the face]
Jane Foster: Sorry. I just needed to make sure you were real, it's been a very strange day.
Thor: Well, I am. Jane... [suddenly she slaps him again]
Jane Foster: Where were you?!
Thor: Where were you? Heimdall could not see you.
Jane Foster: I was right here where you left me. I was waiting and then I was crying and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back
Thor: I know, I know, but the Bifrost was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos, wars were raging, marauding hordes were pillaging. I had to put an end to the slaughter.
Jane Foster: As excuses go, that's not terrible. But I saw you on TV, you were...you were in New York!
Thor: Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong, I was a fool. [Thor places his hand Jane's face] I believe that fate brought us together. Jane, I don't know where you were or what happened, but I do know this.
Jane Foster: What?
Thor: I know...
Jane Foster: You do?
Thor: Do what? [they lean in close and just as they are about to kiss Darcy interrupts them; referring to the rain]
Jane Foster: Hey! Is that you? [Thor looks up and the rain stops]
Jane Foster: Uh...we're kind of in the middle of something.
Darcy Lewis: Um...I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.
Jane Foster: [to Thor] Hold that thought. [she turns and runs towards the police]
Darcy Lewis: Look at you, still all muscly and everything. How's space?
Thor: Space is fine. [Jane walks over to the police]
Jane Foster: Excuse me?
Police Officer #1: Are you Jane Foster?
Jane Foster: Yes.
Police Officer #1: [referring to Ian] Do you know this man?
Jane Foster: He's my intern. My intern's intern.
Police Officer #1: This is private property and you're trespassing, the lot of you. You'll have to come with me. [the police officer goes t grab Jane's arm but suddenly the force from the Aether creates a powerful force which pushes the officer and everything else away, Thor runs towards Jane who's lying on the ground]
Thor: Jane! Jane? [he helps her stand] You alright?
Jane Foster: What just happened? [the other police officer approaches Jane apprehensively]
Police Officer #2: Place your hands on your head, step back!
Thor: The woman is unwell.
Police Officer #2: She's dangerous.
Thor: So am I. [talking into his radio]
Police Officer #2: Requesting armed response officers to the scene. [Thor grabs Jane and pulls her closer to him]
Thor: Hold on to me.
Jane Foster: What are you doing? [suddenly the Bifrost opens and Thor takes Jane to Asgard; Darcy looks up as they disappear]
Darcy Lewis: Holy shit! [Thor and Jane travel through the Bifrost and enter Asgard where Heimdall is guarding as always, Jane looks around her in amazement]
Jane Foster: We have to do that again. [she notices Heimdall for the first time] Hi.
Heimdall: Welcome to Asgard. [returning to their homeland, Svartalfheim, Malekith kneels and grabs a handful of dust from the ground]
Malekith: [subtitled] Look at my legacy, Algrim. I barely remember the time before light. [Algrim places his hand on Malekith's shoulder]
Algrim: [subtitled] Our survival will be your legacy.
Malekith: [subtitled] The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world and I'll put an end to this poisonous world. [as the Asgardian physicians study Jane and the force within her]
Jane Foster: What's that?
Eir: Be still. [Thor watches with one of the nurses as they examine Jane]
Thor: This is not of Earth, what is it?
Asgardian Nurse: We do not know, but she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her. [the nurse turns and walks away as Thor looks at Jane with worry]
Jane Foster: That's a quantum field generator, isn't it?
Eir: It's a Soul Forge.
Jane Foster: Does a Soul Forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another? [Eir looks impressed]
Eir: Yes. [Jane looks at Thor and whispers]
Jane Foster: It's a quantum field generator. [Thor smiles at her] [Odin enters the room as the Thor looks on to Jane as she is being examined]
Odin: My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely?
Thor: She's ill.
Odin: She is mortal. Illness is their defining trait.
Thor: I brought here because we can help her.
Odin: She does not belong here in Asgard anymore than a goat belongs at a banquet table. [Jane sits up and looks at Thor]
Jane Foster: Did he just...? [to Odin] Who do you think you are?
Odin: I'm Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.
Jane Foster: Oh. Well, I'm...
Odin: I know very well who you are, Jane Foster. [Jane turns to look at Thor]
Jane Foster: You told your Dad about me?
Thor: Something is within her, father, something I have not seen before.
Odin: Her world has its healers, their called doctors, let them deal with it. Guards, take her back to Midgard. [as two guards approach Jane and go to grab her, suddenly the energy force within her sets off again throwing the two guards aside]
Thor: Don't touch her. [he leans down and tenderly touches Jane] Jane, are you alright? [Jane nods her head, Odin inspects the energy force running through Jane's body and realizes it's the Aether]
Odin: That's impossible.
Eir: The infection, it's defending her.
Thor: No, it's defending itself.
Odin: Come with me. There are relics that predate the universe itself. What lies within her appears to be one of them. The Nine Realms are not eternal. They had a dawn as they will have a dusk. [Odin shows Thor and Jane an ancient book] But before that dawn the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged.
Thor: [reading from the book] "Born of eternal night, the Dark Elves comes to steal away your light." They were these stories mother told us as children.
Odin: Their leader, Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness, it was called the Aether. While the other relics often appeared as stones, the Aether is fluid and ever changing. It changes matter into dark matter and seeks out to host bodies, drawing strength from their life force. Malekith sought to use the Aether's power to return the universe to one of darkness. But after eternities of blood shed, my father Bor, finally triumphed, ushering in the peace that lasted thousands of years.
Jane Foster: What happened?
Odin: He killed them all.
Thor: Are you certain? The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them and yet here it is.
Odin: The Dark Elves are dead.
Jane Foster: Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?
Odin: No, it does not. [back on Svartalfheim, in his ship Malekith plots his vengeance against the Asgardians]
Malekith: [subtitled] The Realms will be aligned soon. [Malekith takes out a knife and turns to Algrim]
Malekith: [subtitled] You'll be the last of the Kursed. [Malekith stabs Algrim in the stomach with his knife]
Algrim: [subtitled] Let my life be sacrificed. The same as our people.
Malekith: [subtitled] You will become darkness, doomed to this existence until it consumes you. [one of the dark elves places a molten rock in Malekith's hand and Malekith places it inside Algrim's stomach] And then no power of our enemies will stop me.
Algrim: [subtitled] I'll destroy their defenses and resurrect the universe. [Malekith looks to one of his dark elves as he carries a mask] [Fandral and Volstagg return to Asgard with several prisoners, including the masked Algrim; Loki watches them from his cell as they come in]
Loki: Odin continues to bring me new friends. How thoughtful.
Frigga: The books I sent, do they not interest you? [Loki turns and we see Frigga is in Loki's cell]
Loki: Is that how I'm to while away eternity, reading?
Frigga: I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.
Loki: Have you? Does Odin share your concern? Does Thor? It must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night.
Frigga: You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.
Loki: My actions. I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life, that I was born to be a king.
Frigga: A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?
Loki: A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.
Frigga: Your father...
Loki: [shouts] He's not my father!
Frigga: Then am I not your mother? [Loki hesitates for a moment]
Loki: You're not. [Frigga smiles at him with tears in her eyes]
Frigga: Always so perceptive about everyone but yourself. [she takes a step towards him and extends her hands, Loki goes to touch her hand but his hand goes through hers and we see that she's a hologram, Loki looks at Frigga with sadness and her hologram disappears] [Jane and Thor walk in Asgard]
Jane Foster: When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.
Thor: Well Heimdall had lost sight of you, you were no longer on Earth.
Jane Foster: Well, how's that possible?
Thor: I believe you were in between worlds. The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil, orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun. Every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly, we call this the Convergence. [he takes her hand and he shows her by touching his palm to hers] During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred. It's possible you found one of these points. We are lucky that it remained open. Once the worlds pass out of alignment, the connection is lost. [he leans closer and they kiss]
Jane Foster: I liked the way you explained that. What's gonna happen to me?
Thor: I'll find a way to save you, Jane.
Jane Foster: Your father said there was...
Thor: My father doesn't know everything. [suddenly they are interrupted by Frigga]
Frigga: Don't let him hear you say that.
Thor: Jane Foster, please meet Frigga, the Queen of Asgard, my mother. [Jane looking embarrassed quickly removes her hand from Thor's mother, Frigga]
Jane Foster: Hi. [in his cell, Algrim pulls out the rock that Malekith had placed in his stomach, he crushes it in his hand, transforming himself into a Kursed, he breaks free and releases the other prisoners, Loki watches all this from his cell, then Algrim walks up to Loki's cell and he look at Loki for a moment before turning and walking away]
Loki: You might want to take the stairs to the left. [Algrim turns and looks at Loki before walking away again; outside they hear the prison alarm going off]
Frigga: The prisons.
Thor: Loki.
Frigga: [referring to Jane] Go, I will look after her. [Thor takes off with his hammer; in the prison Volstagg and Fandral enter the fight with the prisoners]
Fandral: It's as if they resent being imprisoned.
Volstagg: There's no pleasing some creatures. [as they continue to fight, Loki is sat calmly in his cell reading, suddenly Thor enters and everyone turns to look at him]
Thor: Return to your cells and further harm will come to you. You have my word. [suddenly one of the prisoners punches him in the face] Very well, you don't have my word. [Thor punches him back and starts fighting with the other prisoners]
Odin: [to his guards] Send a squadron to the weapons vault, defend it at all costs. Seal the dungeon.
Frigga: Odin.
Odin: Frigga. [to the Asgardian guards] Go! [to Frigga and Jane] It's a skirmish, nothing to fear.
Frigga: You've never been a very good liar. [at that moment Jane notices Sif as she walks past them]
Odin: Take her to you chambers, I'll come for you when it's safe.
Frigga: You take care.
Odin: Despite all I have survived, my queen still worries over me.
Frigga: It's only because I worry over you that you have survived. [Odin goes off, Frigga leads Jane away, she takes a sword from one of the guards] Listen to me now, I need you to do everything I ask and no questions.
Jane Foster: Yes, ma'am. [as Heimdall is stood in his usual guarding post, he suddenly hears something turns and runs out onto the Bifrost Bridge, he jumps onto one of Malekith's ships cloaked in invisibility, making it visible and manages to send it crashing into the sea, but he soon finds that a giant ship is behind him releasing smaller ships to attack Asgard, Heimdall activates a shield to protect Asgard but Algrim manages to deactivate it sending a ship to crash into the palace] [after Malekith's ship has crashed into the palace the Dark Elves start attacking the Asgardian soldiers killing them all, Malekith leaves the ship and goes to look for Frigga and Jane after which Odin arrives to find all the soldiers killed]
Odin: Frigga. [Malekith finds the tower where Frigga is hiding Jane and enters the room]
Frigga: Stand down, creature. You may still survive this.
Malekith: I have survived worse, woman.
Frigga: Who are you?
Malekith: I am Malekith, and I would have what it is mine. [as he walks closer to Frigga she strikes him in the face with her sword, he takes out his blade and starts fighting with Frigga, she puts up a good fight but Algrim comes to his aid and subdues her, Malekith walks towards Jane] You have taken something, child. Give it back. [Malekith stands in front of Jane and as he goes to grab her she disappears and he realizes that she's a hologram, he turns to Frigga] Witch! Where is the Aether?
Frigga: I'll never tell.
Malekith: I believe you. [suddenly Algrim stabs Frigga in the back, at the same time Thor rushes in and shoots a lightning bolt at Malekith's face, severely scarring it, he and Algrim escape and jump onto their ship before Thor can catch them; after Malekith and Algrim escape Odin arrives to find Frigga dead, he holds her body in his arms as Thor and Jane look on, a funeral is held for Frigga where all the Asgardians mourn her as her body is pushed out to the sea on a boat and the boat burnt by a flaming arrow, at the same time Loki expresses his grief in his cell] [back on Earth Erik has been institutionalized and is trying to explain the convergence to the patients in his ward]
Erik Selvig: The universe rotates on a five thousand year cycle, and once its cycled all the worlds align. [he picks up a shoe and holds it up] Imagine...imagine that this is our world, and...and... [one of the patients hands him another shoe] Oh, thank you. And this is another world. Normally they're separate, but during the alignment everything is connected. All Nine Realms, all Nine Realms are passing through each other and gravity, light, and even matter, is crunching from one world to the other. [he demonstrates with the shoes by smacking one on top of the other repeatedly] But if this happens to us now, the result would be cataclysmic. [he then puts the shoes down and picks up two pencils and holds them up] My gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence. [he puts the pencil down and picks up the shoes again] This time the alignment, and all the other worlds, would just pass up by. It's beautiful. It's simple. Any questions? [we see the patients in the ward just carrying on with their activity, no one has really taken any notice of him, then one of the patients (Stan Lee) interrupts]
Patient: Yeah. Can I have my shoe back? [on their ship; to Malekith]
Algrim: [subtitled] I need your strength to reclaim the Aether. And when you wake up, you will kill them all.[in Asgard, Jane is sat in her room when suddenly the power of the Aether surrounds her and everything around her turns red for a moment, then Volstagg enters the room with two guards]
Einherjar Lieutenant: Jane Foster. You need to come with us. [Fandral and Odin inspect the damage to the palace where Malekith had crashed his ship]
Fandral: We are still unable to restore the palace shields. Our artillery cannot detect them, even Heimdall cannot see them. My King, we are all but defenseless. [Thor approaches them]
Thor: She's your prisoner now? [to Fandral, Volstagg and the guards] Leave us. [they all start walking off and leave Thor with Odin]
Odin: I do not wish to fight with you.
Thor: Nor I with you, but I intend to pursue Malekith.
Odin: We possess the Aether, Malekith will come to us.
Thor: Yes, and you will destroy us.
Odin: You overestimate the power of these creatures.
Thor: No, I value our peoples lives. I'll take Jane to the Dark World and draw the enemy away from Asgard. When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane it will be exposed vulnerable, and I will destroy it and him.
Odin: If you fail, you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemies.
Thor: The risk is far greater if we do nothing. His ship could be over our heads right now and we'd never even know it.
Odin: If and when he comes, his men will fall by ten thousand Asgardian blades.
Thor: And how of our men shall fall on theirs?
Odin: As many as are needed! [there's a moment pause] We will fight! Until the last Asgardian breath, the last drop of Asgardian blood.
Thor: And how are you different from Malekith? [Odin chuckles]
Odin: The difference, my son, is that I will win. [Odin turns and walks off] [back on Earth, Darcy paces around her apartment as Ian is sat watching the news on TV]
Darcy Lewis: Jane isn't called me back. Erik isn't calling me back. Stupid SHIELD isn't calling me back!
Ian Boothby: What's SHIELD?
Darcy Lewis: It's a secret. [Darcy leaves a voice message for Erik] Uh...hey, Erik. It's Darcy again. Uh...Thor came back, he took Jane to Asgard and um...I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. [as Ian is watching the news they start reporting about Erik being arrested at Stonehenge]
News Reporter: Something else went missing this week when Astrophysicist, Dr. Erik Selvig, notable for his involvement in the Alien invasion in New York streaked nude across Stonehenge.
Ian Boothby: Darcy, you really need to look at this. Your friend Erik, what was his last name again? [Darcy looks at the news report on TV]
News Reporter: ...disrobed and began shouting at visitors at the historic site. He was later taken into police custody for psychiatric evaluation. The police are still refusing to confirm... [Ian presses the pause button on Erik's face from footage taken at Stonehenge, Darcy sits in dismay as she looks at Erik's face on the TV] [in Asgard, Thor is sat alone when Heimdall walks up to him]
Thor: You're not in Odin's war council?
Heimdall: The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders. No one is to come or to go. [Heimdall takes off his helmet and places it on the table] We face an enemy that is invisible even to me. Of what use is a guardian such as that? [he sits down looking defeated]
Thor: Malekith will return, you know this. I'll need your help.
Heimdall: I cannot overrule my King's wishes, not even for you.

Thor: I'm not asking you to. The Realms need their All-Father strong and unchallenged, whether he is or not. But he is blinded, Heimdall, by hatred and by grief.
Heimdall: As are we all.
Thor: Well I see clearly enough.
Heimdall: The risks are too great.
Thor: Everything that we do from here on is a risk, there is no other way. [Heimdall hesitates before replying]
Heimdall: What do you require of me?
Thor: What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order. Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death. Malekith knew the Aether was here, he can sense its power. If we do nothing he will come for it again, but this time lay waste to all of Asgard. [we see Thor holding a meeting with Sif, Fandral, Volstagg and Heimdall] We must move Jane off world.
Sif: The Bifrost has been shut down and the Tesseract locked away in a vault.
Heimdall: There are other paths off Asgard, ways known only to a few.
Thor: One, actually. [the others suddenly realize he means Loki]
Volstagg: No. [Thor walks up to Loki's cell where he is standing looking well kept and clean]
Loki: Thor, after all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?
Thor: Loki, enough. No more illusions. [suddenly Loki's cell is transformed, the illusion is lifted and we see that Loki's cell is a mess, everything has been thrown around and he's sat on the floor, looking unkempt and messy, in the other corner of the cell]
Loki: Now you see me, brother. [Thor walks up to the other side of the cell to be closer to Loki] Did she suffer?
Thor: I did not come here to share our grief. Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.
Loki: Go on.
Thor: I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you, vengeance. And afterward, this cell. [Loki chuckles]
Loki: You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?
Thor: I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me and I will kill you. [Loki smiles]
Loki: Hmm. When do we start? [back to the meeting with Thor and his comrades]
Fandral: He will betray you.
Thor: He will try. [Loki and Thor walk out of the Asgardian prison]
Loki: This is so unlike you, brother. So clandestine. Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out?
Thor: If you keep speaking I just might.
Loki: Fine. As you wish. I'm not even here. [using his diversion tactics Loki turns himself into an Asgardian guard] Is this better?
Thor It's better company at least.
Loki: Still, we could be less conspicuous. [Loki turns back into himself but turns Thor into Sif] Hm, brother. You look ravishing. [Thor looks down at his body then replies in his own voice]
Thor: It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.
Loki: Very well. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions, given that you seem to like them so much. [Loki then turns himself into Captain America in his full Captain America costume] Oh, this is much better. Woh. The costume's a bit much, so tight. But the confidence, I can feel the righteousness surging. Hey, you wanna have a rousing discussion about truth, honor, patriotism? God bless Amer– [suddenly Thor grabs hold of Loki puts his hand over his mouth and pushes him against the wall making Loki turn back into himself] What? [Thor looks to the side and they see two Asgardian guards walking away] You could at least furnish me with a weapon. My dagger, something! [Thor looks at him and we hear a noise like a sword being drawn] At last, a little common sense. [Loki then looks down then holds up his hands which now have iron handcuffs on them]
Thor: And I thought you liked tricks. [Thor laughs and turns to walk off] [back at the original meeting Thor was holding with his comrades]
Fandral: Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of our Einherjar who will see you coming from miles away.
Thor: I won't be the one who comes for her. [Thor looks over to Sif; then we see Jane is sat in her guarded room when one of the guards enters]
Jane Foster: I'm not hungry. [suddenly Sif comes up behind the guard and knocks him out, she looks over to Jane]
Sif: Good, let's go. [Jane and Sif meet up with Thor with Loki standing beside him, Jane points to Loki]
Jane Foster: You're...
Loki: I'm Loki. You may have heard of... [suddenly Jane slaps Loki hard in the face]
Jane Foster: That was for New York. [Loki smiles and looks at Thor]
Loki: I like her. [back at Thor's meeting with his comrades]
Sif: And what of the All-Father?
Heimdall: It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne. [Odin visits Heimdall accompanied by some of his guards]
Odin: You called me here on an urgent matter. What is it?
Heimdall: Treason, my lord.
Odin: Whose?
Heimdall: Mine. [Heimdall draws his sword, at the same time more guards interrupt them]
Einherjar Lieutenant: My King, the mortal has been taken. [Odin looks at Heimdall as he commands his guards]
Odin: Stop Thor, by any means necessary. [as they hear the guards approaching]
Guards: There they are! Take them. On my command.
Sif: I'll hold them off. Take her.
Thor: Thank you. [Thor and Jane go off, as Loki goes to follow them Sif draws her sword and places it under Loki's throat]
Sif: Betray him and I'll kill you. [Loki chuckles]
Loki: It's good to see you too, Sif. [Loki leaves to join Thor and Jane as the guards get closer to Sif; back at the original meeting with Thor and his comrades]
Volstagg: Assuming you can get Loki's help, and you can free this mortal, what good would it do? We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.
Thor: That, my friend, is where we won't be leaving by foot. [Thor, Loki and Jane meet Volstagg where Malekith's ship had crashed into the palace]
Volstagg: I will give you as much time as I can.
[Thor and Volstagg do a forearm shake]

Thor: Thank you, my friend. [as they walk towards Malekith's crashed ship, Jane smiles and nods at Volstagg, then as Loki is about to follow Thor and Jane Volstagg stops him]
Volstagg: If you even think about betraying him...
Loki: You'll kill me? Evidently there will be a line. [Volstagg then lets him pass] [Thor, Jane and Loki board Malekith's crashed ship, Thor looks at the controls and starts pressing some button, looking unsure of what he's doing] I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.
Thor: I said, "how hard could it be?" [meanwhile, the Asgardian guards rush towards the ship with Volstagg standing guard in front of it]
Guard: They're on the ship!
Loki: They're on the ship! [as they approach the ship Volstagg starts attacking them; back in the ship] Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster.
Thor: Shut up, Loki. [outside the ship Volstagg continues to battle with the Asgardian guards; back in the ship Thor continues to frantically press every button to start the ship]
Loki: You must have missed something.
Thor: No, I didn't, I'm pressing every button on this thing.
Loki: No, don't hit it, just press it gently. [as he hits the buttons]
Thor: I am pressing it gently. It's not working! [suddenly the ship comes to life, Thor laughs; outside the ship Volstagg is overrun by the guards.]
Guards: Get him! Get him!
[Volstagg starts laughing as they watch the ship start to rise, hitting the columns of the palace]
Loki: I think you missed a column.
Thor: Shut up! [finally the ship breaks through the palace walls and takes off] [as they are flying through Asgard]
Loki: Look, why don't you let me take over, I'm clearly the better pilot.
Thor: Is that right? Well, out of the two of us which one can actually fly? [as they are flying over Asgard suddenly Jane collapses]
Loki: Oh, dear. Is she dead?
Thor: Jane. [Jane raises her head, looking weak]
Jane Foster: I'm okay. [as they continue to fly, the ship hits and breaks off a part of a massive building; to Loki]
Thor: Not a word. [several smaller Asgardian ships start following them]
Loki: Now they're following us. [the smaller ships start firing at them] Now they're firing at us!
Thor: Yeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki! It's not at all distracting! [the ship then hits a massive stone monument of King Bor, breaking the head off]
Loki: Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather. [the smaller ships continue to follow and fire at them as they fly over Asgard] You know this is wonderful. This is a tremendous idea. Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that. Flying around the city, smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us. It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant! [suddenly Thor pushes Loki off the ship, Thor then picks up Jane and jumps off the flying ship and lands onto a smaller ship being flown by Fandral, Loki has also fallen onto the ship]
Fandral: [laughs] I see your time in the dungeons has made you no less graceful, Loki. [the Asgardian ships above them continue to follow and fire at Malekith's ship as they think that Thor is still on there] [Thor lays Jane down]
Loki: You lied to me. I'm impressed.
Thor: I'm glad you're pleased. Now, do as you promised. Take us to your secret pathway. [Loki smiles and takes over the ship's control, at the same time the Asgardian ships spot them and start firing at them] Fandral.
Fandral: Right. [Fandral picks up a rope and steps on to the edge of the ship] For Asgard. [suddenly he jumps off the ship and uses the rope to swing onto the Asgardian ship following them] Nothing personal, boys! [he knocks out the three guards on the ship then looks over to Thor and salutes him; on Fandral's ship Loki flies them towards the mountains]
Thor: Loki!
Loki: If it were easy everyone would do it.
Thor: Are you mad?
Loki: Possibly. [Thor holds on to Jane, as Loki heads straight for the wall of the mountain, suddenly they enter right through the mountain and then enter through a portal to Svartalfheim] Ta-da! [on their ship, Algrim approaches Malekith]
Algrim: [subtitled] We must attack now.
Malekith: [subtitled] No. Asgard is not important anymore. The Aether has returned home. [as they fly over Svartalfheim, Jane continues to lie down and Thor puts a cover over her]
Loki: [sighs] What I could do with the power that flows through those veins.
Thor: It would consume you.
Loki: She's holding up alright, for now.
Thor: She's strong in ways you'd never even know.
Loki: Say goodbye.
Thor: Not this day.
Loki: This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing. It's a heart beat. You'll never be ready. The only woman whose love you've prized will be snatched from you.
Thor: And will that satisfy you?
Loki: Satisfaction is not in my nature.
Thor: Surrender not in mine.
Loki: The son of Odin.
Thor: No, not just of Odin! You think you alone were loved of mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!
Loki: Trust. Was that her last expression? Trust? When you let her die!
Thor: What help were you in your cell?
Loki: Who put me there? Who put me there?! [Thor grabs hold of Loki]
Thor: You know damn well! You know damn well who! [Thor raises his fist to punch Loki but stops himself] She wouldn't want us to fight.
Loki: Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked. [they both smile]
Thor: I wish I could trust you. [Thor turns his back to Loki]
Loki: Trust my rage. [back on Earth, Darcy and Ian go to free Erik from the mental institution]
Desk Officer: You'll have to sign for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig. [Ian looks distracted and Darcy nudges him to bring him to attention]
Ian Boothby: What? Oh, yeah. My father, Dr. Erik Selvig. [Ian goes to sign the form]
Desk Officer: One; a man's leather wallet, brown. One key ring with three keys. Prescription medicine. [he places the, wallet, key ring with the keys and a plastic bag containing medicine bottles on the counter] Various. [the officer then bends to pick up another item from behind the counter, at the same time Darcy notices Erik being escorted towards them]
Darcy Lewis: Erik.
Desk Officer: And... [the officer places Erik's gadgets on the counter] These.
Ian Boothby: Yeah, those. Thank goodness. [as Erik comes towards Darcy]
Darcy Lewis: Erik.
Erik Selvig: Yes?
Darcy Lewis: It's uh...Darcy.
Erik Selvig: Darcy. [Darcy holds up her hands and smiles, Erik then hugs her] It's so good to see you.
Darcy Lewis: Uh...I missed you too. [Darcy looks awkward as Erik continues to hold her tightly]
Erik Selvig: How did you find me?
Ian Boothby: You were naked on TV.
Darcy Lewis: Okay, time to go. Lots to do. [Erik continues to hold her] Getting weird now. [as they walk down the corridor of the mental institution with Ian holding Erik's gadgets] I should not be left in charge of stuff like this, I don't get paid enough. I don't get paid period. [Erik takes his bag of medicine from Ian]
Ian Boothby: I'm uh...Ian by the way. Uh..Darcy's intern. I don't get paid either. [Ian watches as Erik takes out a bottle of pills] Are you alright?
Erik Selvig: I have had a God in my brain. I don't recommend it. [as they step out of the building suddenly the gadget in Ian arms starts to beep]
Ian Boothby: Dr. Selvig, your gear is beeping at me.
Erik Selvig: It's happening, sooner than I calculated.
Darcy Lewis: Wait, what's happening? [they look up to see flock of birds flying above them] Birds? Birds are happening?
Ian Boothby: They're starlings, it's called a murmuration. My dad used to take me bird watching as a kid.
Darcy Lewis: Erik?
Erik Selvig: Look. [suddenly the birds all fly in the same direction and they all suddenly disappear]
Darcy Lewis: Where did they go? [suddenly all the birds appear behind, them flying away frantically making Darcy screams in terror] What the hell was that?! [Erik smiles] Why are you smiling?
Erik Selvig: There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are. [he walks ahead and throws his bag of medicine into the garbage bin nearby] Take me to Jane's lab! [on Svartalfheim, as they continue flying on their ship suddenly Jane's eyes open, it's clear that the Aether has taken her over, she rises and looks ahead]
Thor: Jane.
Jane Foster: Malekith. [after landing their ship, they walk over to watch Malekith and his men in the distance]
Thor: Alright, are you ready? [Jane nods her head]
Loki: I am. [they rise from their hiding spot and Malekith spots them standing on a hill in the distance] You know this plan of yours is going to get us killed.
Thor: Yeah, possibly. [Loki holds up his shackled hands for Thor to uncuff him]
Loki: You still don't trust me, brother?
Thor: Would you? [Thor takes off Loki's cuffs]
Loki: No, I wouldn't. [suddenly Loki takes out a dagger stabs Thor and throws him down the hill]
Jane Foster: Thor! No! [Malekith sees this and starts walking towards them] [after stabbing Thor and throwing him down the hill, Loki walks over to Thor]
Loki: You really think I cared about Frigga, about any of you? [he kicks Thor in the stomach] All I ever wanted was you and Odin dead at my feet! [Thor raises his hand, attempting to summon Mjolnir, but Loki cuts off his hand making Thor scream out in pain, Jane rushes over to Thor but Loki grabs her and turns to face Malekith and his dark elves] Malekith, I am Loki of Jotunheim and I bring you a gift! [he throws Jane at Malekith's feet] I ask only one thing in return, a good seat from which to watch Asgard burn.
Algrim: [to Malekith] [subtitled] He is an enemy of Asgard, he was locked in a cell. [Malekith walks over to Thor squirming in pain on the ground]
Malekith: Look at me. [Malekith uses his foot to turn Thor, he then lifts Jane in the air and extracts the Aether from her, in that moment Jane has a vision of Earth, then as the Aether leaves her body Jane falls to the ground]
Thor: Loki, now! [Loki uses his diversion tactics and we see that he had never amputated Thor's hand, Thor quickly summons Mjolnir and shoots lightning at the Aether attempting to destroy it, but he fails as Malekith is still able to absorb it and turns to leave on his ship] [two of the dark elves start attacking Thor but he quickly takes them down, Algrim then throws one of his vortex weapons in the air, Loki pushes Jane away and he is nearly sucked in when Thor pulls him out, Thor then attacks Algrim but he beats Thor down, Loki goes over to them and impales Algrim from behind, Algrim slowly turns and suddenly pulls Loki into the blade that is sticking out from him] No! [Algrim takes a step towards Loki]
Loki: See you in hell, monster! [Algrim then realizes that attached to the blade in him is his own vortex weapon, it explodes before he can do anything destroying him; Thor then rushes over to Loki]
Thor: No. No, no, no! Oh, you fool, you didn't listen!
Loki: I know. I'm a fool. I'm a fool! [Loki squirms in pain]
Thor: Stay with me, okay?
Loki: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Thor: Shh.
Loki: I'm sorry.
Thor: It's okay. [Thor nods his head] It's alright. I'll tell father what you did here today.
Loki: I didn't do it for him. [he closes his eyes and as he dies his skin turns to it's blue Frost Giant form, Thor cries out in anguish]
Thor: No! [Thor looks at Jane as he weeps for Loki] [after Loki's death, Thor and Jane enter a cave as they see a storm approaching]
Jane Foster: He's gonna unleash it, not just on Asgard or on a star, Malekith is gonna destroy everything.
Thor: How? Jane, how?
Jane Foster: I saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?
Thor: The Convergence.
Jane Foster: Oh, God. None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.
Thor: Then Malekith would have only possessed it that much sooner.
Jane Foster: I only found it because I was looking for you.
Thor: Jane. [he places his hand on her face]
Jane Foster: Now we're trapped here. [suddenly they hear music playing, Jane and Thor look at each other in confusion]
Thor: It's not me. [Jane realizes it's her cell phone, she takes it out of her pocket and answers it]
Jane Foster: Hello?
Richard: Hi, Jane, it's Richard.
Jane Foster: Richard?! Where are you?
Richard: I'm still in the office. It's...It's been a crazy day here today. [Jane puts him on speaker and holds up her phone]
Jane Foster: Oh, my God! This is amazing.
Richard: Is it? I quite enjoyed our lunch despite never actually ordering anything.
Jane Foster: How am I getting service here?
Richard: Is this a bad time? Do you want me to try you there?
Jane Foster: No, no, no, no! Please, whatever you do, do not hang up the phone.
Richard: Okay then. I was just wondering if you want to try again? Uh...maybe dinner next time.
Jane Foster: Uh...yeah, yeah, yeah. Um...just stay on the phone, okay?
Richard: Yeah, I will. [Jane looks down and notices can and keys that were thrown through from the abandoned factory]
Jane Foster: Oh, my God. [Jane picks up the keys from the floor of the cave]
Richard: Am I interrupting something.
Jane Foster: No, no, no, nothing at all. [realizing how they can return to Earth, Jane turns to Thor] Come on.
Richard: I'm losing you there, are you in a tunnel? [Thor starts following Jane]
Thor: Where are we going?
Richard: [to Jane] Hello? [they start walking further into the cave, Thor notices the discarded shoes that were thrown through from the abandoned factory]
Thor: Why are there so many shoes in here? [as they walks further in suddenly they disappear; back in his office Richard loses Jane on the phone]
Richard: I'll just text her. [Jane and Thor appear back on Earth outside the factory, they get into Ian's abandoned car still parked outside the factory and Jane tries to start the car]
Darcy Lewis: Jane!
Jane Foster: Hey.
Darcy Lewis: You can't just leave like that, the whole world is going crazy! [Thor hangs his hammer on the coat hanger next to the door] All the stuff we saw is spreading. [she looks at Jane's Asgardian clothes and disheveled state] Did you go to a party? [Jane notices Erik for the first time]
Jane Foster: Erik?!
Erik Selvig: Jane, how wonderful! [he rises and goes to Jane and as he embraces her we see he isn't wearing any pants] You've been to Asgard.
Jane Foster: Where are your pants?
Ian Boothby: Oh, uh...he uh...he says it helps him think.
Jane Foster: Okay. Well, I'm gonna need everything you got on this. All the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies, everything.
Erik Selvig: Okay.
Thor: Are you well, Erik? [Erik chuckles then his smile fades quickly]
Erik Selvig: Your brother is not coming, is he?
Thor: Loki is dead.
Erik Selvig: Oh, thank God. [Thor looks at him in confusion] I...I'm so sorry.
Thor: Thank you. [Erik then embraces Thor] [back on Svartalfheim we see an Einherjar Guard use the ship that brought Thor, Loki and Jane onto the planet to return to Asgard, he goes to see Odin at the palace]
Einherjar Guard: Forgive me, my liege. I've returned from the Dark World with news.
Odin: Thor?
Einherjar Guard: There's no sign of Thor, or the weapon, but... [he takes a step closer to Odin]
Odin: What?
Einherjar Guard: We found a body. [there's a moment's pause]
Odin: Loki. [the warrior doesn't reply but just looks at Odin] [back at Jane's apartment]
Jane Foster: Malekith is going to fire the Aether at a spot where all the nine worlds are connected.
Erik Selvig: Amplifying the weapon's impact. With each additional world, the power will increase exponentially. The effect would be universal.
Thor: Yes, well the alignment is only temporary. He must be in exactly at the right place at the right time.
Darcy Lewis: Well, how do we know where that is?
Erik Selvig: We follow the directions. This has happened before, thousands of years ago, and The Ancients were there to see it. [Erik places a map of the British Isles on the coffee table] All the great constructions: the Mayas, the Chinese, the Egyptians, they made use of the gravitational effects of the Convergence. And they left us a map. [he starts drawing on the map] Stonehenge. Snowdon, the Great Orme. These are all coordinates taking us...here. [he points to Greenwich on the map]
Ian Boothby: Greenwich?
Jane Foster: The walls between worlds will be almost non-existent. Physics is gonna go ballistic. Increase and decrease in gravity, spatial extrusions. The very fabric of reality is gonna be torn apart. [Thor summons Mjolnir and it shoots over to Thor's hand from the where it was hanging on the coat hanger]
Erik Selvig: I better get my pants. [in Greenwich at the location outside a library Darcy and Ian grab Erik's gadget]
Darcy Lewis: Focus, this is important. We have to hammer them in all around the site and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.
Ian Boothby: They're taped together!
Darcy Lewis: Do you even know what these things do?
Ian Boothby: No.
Darcy Lewis: Neither do I. [Darcy and Ian start placing Erik's gadgets around the library grounds] Come on, come on!
Ian Boothby: Fine! [suddenly Malekith's giant ship appears on the River Thames near the library grounds]
Darcy Lewis: Holy shit! [the ship starts moving forward and crashing through the library grounds causing pandemonium until it finally stops in the middle of the grounds, Malekith and his dark elves step off the ship and the same time Thor flies in and lands in front of Malekith]
Malekith: You needn't have come so far, Asgardian! Death would have come to you soon enough.
Thor: Not by your hand!
Malekith: Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be extinguished. [Malekith uses the power of the Aether to attack Thor but Thor manages to narrowly miss getting hit by it] [inside the library setting up the gravimetric device]
Erik Selvig: We're running out of time.
Jane Foster: Almost there.
Erik Selvig: Are you sure this is going to work? These devices were made to detect anomalies, not cause them.
Jane Foster: Oh, come on. [Jane looks out and sees Thor and Malekith battling it out] Come on, Darcy. [Jane rushes off to find Darcy; outside Thor manages to deflect the Aether that Malekith is using to fight him off]
Thor: You know with all that power, I thought you would hit harder. [as Malekith is using the Aether to shield himself suddenly Thor throws his hammer at him which throws Malekith across the ground and smashes him against the library building, at the same time Jane sees Darcy and Ian placing the last of Erik's device in the ground]
Ian Boothby: Done. [Darcy gives the OK sign to Jane and Jane rushes back to Erik]
Erik Selvig: The Convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes.
Jane Foster: That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight. [Jane gets the device ready] Okay, you might wanna hold on to something. [she turns on the device and suddenly some of the dark elves suddenly disappear; Darcy and Ian watch this nearby, Darcy talks to Jane on her phone]
Darcy Lewis: That is awesome! How did you do that?
Jane Foster: Well, gravitational fields interact with the weak spot between worlds creating...
Darcy Lewis: Oh, there's a guy with a sword! [Jane uses the device again to make the dark elf disappear but instead she accidentally makes Darcy and Ian disappear]
Jane Foster: Oops.
Erik Selvig: Let's go. [Darcy and Ian appear in another part of London]
Darcy Lewis: What the hell just happened? [suddenly the dark elves that had also disappeared appear and fall onto a parked car] Move! [Darcy grabs hold of Ian's hand and they run off as the dark elves start chasing after them; back at the library Thor and Malekith continue their battle and everyone inside the library rushes to the windows to watch]
Jane Foster: What are you all doing? You need to get out of here! Now!
Student: You're joking, right? That's Thor out there waving his hammer around and everything! [he uses his phone to record the battle outside; in their ensuing fight, Thor and Malekith are transported through the realms to Svartalfheim and London continuously, at the same time a fighter jet flies towards Malekith's ship]
Control: Confirming ship is hostile.
Pilot: Confirm, the ship is hostile. You have permission to engage.
Control: Roger. The missile's locked. The missile's on its way. [the pilot releases the missile] Missile off target! I repeat...
Pilot: Mayday! I'm losing control. Mayday! Mayday! I'm losing control! [the jet is then transported to Valaheim] [as they run through the library ground]
Erik Selvig: What are you doing?
Jane Foster: My signal's lost connection. [some of the dark elves are behind them chasing after them]
Erik Selvig: Jane! Come on! [as Thor and Malekith continue their battle through the realms they land in Jotunheim and are confronted by a giant beast which then is transported to London, at the same time Darcy and Ian are being ambushed by the dark elves when Ian, with the help of the anti-gravitational energy force, grabs a car and throws it at them, Darcy looks at him in shock]
Ian Boothby: Are you alright?
Darcy Lewis: You saved my life.
Ian Boothby: Yeah. Yes, I did. [back at the library grounds Jane manages to make the device work again and as she uses it suddenly makes Darcy and Ian appear behind her in each others arms kissing]
Jane Foster: Darcy?
Darcy Lewis: Jane! [Darcy lets go of Ian and falls to the ground]
Erik Selvig: Ian?
Ian Boothby: Selvig! [suddenly Mjolnir appears and flies past them]
Darcy Lewis: Meowmeow! [Thor and Malekith are then transported through the realms again with Malekith landing back in Greenwich but Thor ends up in Charing Cross Underground Station]
Man: [over speakers] Mind the gap.
[Thor turns to one of the passengers on the underground train that's just arrived]
Thor: How do I get to Greenwich?
Woman on Train: Take this train, three stops. [Thor steps onto the train and places his hand on the bar above him]
Man: [over speakers] Mind the gap.
[as the train starts to move, the movement causes the woman to fall against Thor and she stops herself by placing her hand on his chest]
Woman on Train: Sorry. Sorry. [Thor smiles politely at her]
[in Greenwich the realms come closer to converging, Malekith readies the Aether within him to bring forth the darkness]
Jane Foster: We're out of time. [Jane rushes off ahead]
Erik Selvig: Jane. Jane! [Thor rushes out of the station to watch the Aether taking over]
Jane Foster: Thor! We're too late.
Erik Selvig: The Convergence is at its peak. [Thor looks at the gadget spears in Erik's hand]
Thor: Can those things stop him?
Erik Selvig: Not from here.
Jane Foster: We can't get close enough. [Thor looks at Jane]
Thor: I can. [Thor takes the spears from Erik and rushes off towards Malekith] [Thor pushes through the Aether and reaches Malekith] Malekith! [Malekith turns to face Thor]
Malekith: Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?
Thor: I've come to accept your surrender. [Thor throws one of Erik's gadget spears at Malekith and he catches it, Jane uses the gavemetric which makes his arm disappear and we see it transported to Svartalfheim, Thor throws the other spear at Malekith and he catches it and his other arm disappears]
Malekith: You think you can stop this? The Aether cannot be destroyed.
Thor: But you can. [Thor summons Mjolnir at the same time he rushes towards Malekith and as he grabs his hammer he uses it to throw Malekith into his ship and Jane is able to use her device to transport him Svartalfheim] [after Thor kills Malekith Jane goes to find Thor and finds him lying on the ground, suddenly Malekith's ship starts to crumble, Jane rushes towards the unconscious Thor]
Jane Foster: Thor! No! [Jane turns Thor over grabs his arm and starts to pull him out of the way but he is too heavy, just them Erik, Darcy and Ian arrive on the scene]
Erik Selvig: Jane! [the ship starts to fall, as Jane is not able to move Thor she throws herself on top of him and holds on to him with her eyes closed, just as the ship is about to land on them it disappears and appears on Svartalfheim landing on Malekith and crushing him to death; back in Greenwich] Everybody okay? [Thor becomes conscious and opens his eyes, Darcy smiles and throws her arms around Ian and kisses him passionately] [couple of days later, Jane, Erik, Darcy and Ian are in her apartment sat having breakfast quietly]
Darcy Lewis: He's gonna come back. Except, you know, last time he was gone for, like, two years.
Jane Foster: Well, it's only been two days, so...
Erik Selvig: Did he say anything before he left?
Jane Foster: Yeah, he had to figure some stuff out with his father. He kind of committed treason... on our way out. [Jane looks away and carries on eating her breakfast]
Erik Selvig: Oh.
[On Asgard Thor meets with Odin at the palace]
Odin: You once said there would never be a wiser King than me. You were wrong. The alignment has brought all the realms together. Every one of them saw you offer your life to save them. What can Asgard offer its new King in return?
Thor: My life. Father, I cannot be King of Asgard. I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath, but I cannot do so from that chair. Loki, for all his grave imbalance, understood rule as I know I never will. The brutality, the sacrifice, it changes you. I'd rather be a good man than a great King.
Odin: Is this my son I hear, or the woman he loves?
Thor: When you speak, do I never hear Mother's voice? [Odin sighs] This is not for Jane, Father. She does not know what I came here to say. Now forbid me to see her or say she can rule at my side, it changes nothing.
Odin: One son who wanted the throne too much, another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?
Thor: Loki died with honor, I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough? [Odin nods his head, Thor then holds up Mjolnir to offer it back to Odin]
Odin: It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.
Thor: I shall try to be.
Odin: I cannot give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.
Thor: I know. [Thor turns to leave]
Odin: If I were proud of the man my son had become, even that I could not say. It would speak only from my heart. Go, my son. [Thor smiles]
Thor: Thank you, father. [he turns and starts walking off, as Odin watches Thor walk off Odin's form transform to reveal Loki]
Loki: No. Thank you. [Loki smiles devilishly] [mid-credits scene; Sif and Volstagg are taken to meet, The Collector Taneleer Tivan]
Collector's Assistant: I present to you, Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.
The Collector: Woh, Oh. Asgardians, it's an honor. [he bows theatrically]
Sif: You know why we're here.
The Collector: Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure in your own vault?
Volstagg: The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It's not wise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.
The Collector: That's very wise. [Sif hands the Aether over to The Collector] I can assure you it will be absolutely safe in...in my collection.
Sif: See that it is. [The Collector bows his head, Sif and Volstagg turn and leave]
The Collector: One down, five to go. [after credits scene; at her apartment Jane, Erik, Darcy and Ian hear the sounds of thunder, Jane looks out and smiles as she sees lightning, Jane walks out onto her balcony as Thor appears, they embrace and start kissing passionately; at the same time we see the beast transported from Jotunheim running amok outside the abandoned factory]
[Thor arrives to provide backup to Sif and the Warriors Three]
Sif: I've got this completely under control!
Thor: Is that why everything's on fire?
. . .
[the marauders bring out a rock monster to battle Thor]
Sif: All yours. [steps back]
Thor: Hello. [the beast roars] I accept your surrender.
[the marauders roar with laughter; Thor uppercuts the beast with Mjolnir, reducing it to a pile of rubble]
Thor: Anyone else?
Loki: [mock salute to Odin] I really don't see what all the fuss is about…
Odin: Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death!
Loki: I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent God, just like you.
Odin: We are not gods. We're born, we live, we die, just as humans do.
Loki: Give or take five thousand years.
Odin: All this because Loki desires a throne...
Loki: It is my birthright!
Odin: Your birthright was to DIE! As a child, cast out on a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in, you would not be here now, to hate me.
Loki: If I'm for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't like our little talks, it's just... I don't love them.
Odin: Frigga is the only reason you're still alive, and you will never see her again. You'll spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.
Loki: And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf King while I rot in chains?
Odin: Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done. He will bring order to the Nine Realms, and then, yes, he will be King.
Darcy: Come on, this is exciting. Look! The intern is excited.
Ian: Ian, my name's Ian.
Darcy: Do you want the phase meter?
Jane: No.
Darcy: Bring the phase meter. The toaster looking thing.
Ian: Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.
[Thor and Jane reunite]
Thor: Jane?
[she walks up to him and slaps him]
Jane Foster: Sorry. I just…needed to make sure you were real. It's been a very strange day.
Thor: I am. Jane—
[she slaps him again]
Jane: Where were you?!
Thor: Where were you? Heimdall could not see you.
Jane: I was right here where you left me! I was waiting, and then I was crying, and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back.
Thor: I know. I know, but the Bifröst was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos. Wars were raging, marauders were pillaging…I had to put an end to the slaughter.
[she looks at him blankly for a moment]
Jane: As excuses go, it's not…terrible…But I saw you on TV! You were in New York!
Thor: Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong. I was a fool. I believe that fate brought us together.
[they embrace]
Malekith: [looking out over the ruins of Svartalfheim] Look upon my legacy, Algrim. I can barely remember a time before the light.
Algrim: Our survival will be your legacy.
Malekith: The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world. And I will put an end to this poisoned universe.
Odin: She does not belong in Asgard any more than a goat belongs at a banquet!
Jane: Did he just-? Who do you think you are?
Odin: I am Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.
Jane: Oh. Well I'm-
Odin: I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.
Jane: [to Thor] You told your dad about me?
Frigga: You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.
Loki: My actions? I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life…that I was born to be a king.
Frigga: A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?
Loki: A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.
Frigga: Your father—
Loki: He's not my father!
Frigga: Then am I not your mother?
Loki: You're not.
Frigga: [looks hurt but chuckles] You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself. [Loki looks sorry and reaches for her but she disappears]
[Malekith bursts into Frigga's chamber, hunting for Jane]
Frigga: Stand down, creature, and you may still survive this.
Malekith: I have survived worse, woman.
Frigga: Who are you?
Malekith: I am Malekith... [looks at Jane] and I would have what is mine. [They both draw swords and duel, until Algrim arrives and helps overpower Frigga. Malekith turns to confront Jane] You have taken something, child. Give it back. [Malekith discovers Jane is an illusion and angrily faces a grinning Frigga] WITCH! Where is the Aether?!
Frigga: I'll never tell you.
Malekith: I believe you. [Algrim kills Frigga]
Loki: Thor. After all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?
Thor: Loki, enough. No more illusions. [Loki and the neat room turn to a destroyed room with Loki looking disheveled on the floor]
Loki: Now you see me, brother. Did she suffer? [referring to Frigga]
Thor: I did not come here to share our grief. Instead, I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.
Loki: Go on.
Thor: I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard, and I will grant it to you. Vengeance. And afterward, this cell.
Loki: [chuckles] You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?
Thor: I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me, and I will kill you.
Loki: Hm. When do we start?
[Jane meets Loki]
Jane: You're…
Loki: I'm Loki. You may have heard—
[she hauls off and slaps him]
Jane: That was for New York!
Loki: [to Thor] I like her.
. . .
Sif: Betray him, and I'll kill you.
Loki: Good to see you too, Sif.
. . .
Volstagg: If you even think about betraying him…
Loki: You'll kill me? Evidently, there will be a line.
Loki: You know, this is wonderful! This a tremendous idea! Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that! Flying around the city, smash it into everything in sight so everyone can see us! It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant- [Thor shoves Loki out of the ship, and jumps out with Jane in his arms into a skiff piloted by Fandral]
Fandral: [laughs] I see your time in the dungeon has made you no less graceful, Loki!
Loki: [to Thor] You lied to me. I'm impressed.
Loki: [steering the skiff towards a tiny crevice in the mountain] If it were easy, everyone would do it.
Thor: Are you mad?
Loki: Possibly.
Thor: You think you alone were loved of Mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!
Loki: Trust? Was that her last expression, trust? While you let her die?!
Thor: What good were you in your cell?
Loki: Who put me there? Who put me there?!
Thor: You know damn well! You know damn well who! [pins Loki and is about to hit him but lets him go] She wouldn't want us to fight.
Loki: Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.
Thor: [chuckles] I wish I could trust you.
Loki: [whispers] Trust my rage.
Thor: [holding a dying Loki] I will tell Father what you did here today.
Loki: I didn't do it for him.
[a flock of birds disappears into thin air, then reappears flying out of the ground near Ian, Darcy, and Dr. Selvig]
Darcy: What the hell was that? [to a grinning Dr. Selvig] Why are you smiling?
Dr. Erik Selvig: There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are.
Malekith: You needn't have come so far, Asgardian. Death would have come to you soon enough.
Thor: Not by your hand!
Malekith: Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be EXTINGUISHED!
Malekith: Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?
Thor: I've come to accept your surrender.
Malekith: You think you can stop this?! The Aether cannot be destroyed!
Thor: But you can. [summons Mjolnir and deals the final blow to Malekith]
Odin: One son who wanted the throne too much, and another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?
Thor: Loki died with honour. I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough? [offers the hammer]
Odin: It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.
Thor: I shall try to be.
Odin: I can not give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.
Thor: I know. [turns to leave]
Odin: If I were proud of the man my son has become, even that I could not say, it would speak only from my heart. Go, my son.
Thor: Thank you, Father. [leaves]
Loki: [appears from Odin's guise] No... thank you.
[mid credits scene; Sif and Volstagg arrive in an alien collection]
Carina: I present to you Taneleer Tivan. The Collector.
[the Collector, looking like an alien Liberace, appears and bows]
The Collector: Asgardians! It's an honor.
Sif: You know why we're here. [she hands him the Aether, which he accepts]
The Collector: Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure, in your own vault?
Volstagg: The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It would be unwise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.
The Collector: That's very wise. I can assure you, it will be absolutely safe here in my collection.
Sif: See that it is.
[the Asgardians leave]
The Collector: One down…five to go.(first lines; Sam Wilson is jogging around Washington, D.C. when Steve quickly catches up to him and runs past him.)

Steve Rogers: On your left.

(as Sam continues to jog Steve comes around again quickly after doing another lap.)

Steve Rogers: On your left.

Sam Wilson: Uh-huh, on my left. Got it.

(as Sam is still jogging Steve comes around again from behind him from another lap.)

Sam Wilson: Don't say it! Don't you say it!

Steve Rogers: On your left!

Sam Wilson: Come on!

Steve Rogers: Need a medic?

(Sam laughs.)

Sam Wilson: I need a new set of lungs. Dude, you just ran like 13 miles in 30 minutes.

Steve Rogers: I guess I got a late start.

Sam Wilson: Oh, really? You should be ashamed of yourself. You should take another lap.

(He hesitates for a moment before saying sarcastically.)

Sam Wilson: Did you just take it? I assumed you just took it.

Steve Rogers: What unit you with?

Sam Wilson: 58, Pararescue. But now I'm working down at the VA.

(Sam lifts hand to shake)

Sam Wilson: Sam Wilson.

(Steve gives Sam a hand to rise.)

Steve Rogers: Steve Rogers.

Sam Wilson: Yeah I kind of put that together. Must have freaked you out coming home after the whole defrosting thing.

Steve Rogers: It takes some getting used to. It's good to meet you, Sam.

(as Steve turns to leave.)

Sam Wilson: It's your bed, right?

Steve Rogers: What's that?

Sam Wilson: Your bed, it's too soft. When I was over there I'd sleep on the ground and use rock for pillows, like a caveman. Now I'm home, lying in my bed, and it's like...

Steve Rogers: Lying on a marshmallow. Feel like I'm gonna sink right to the floor.

(Sam smiles and nods his head.)

Steve Rogers: How long?

Sam Wilson: Two tours.

(Awkward Silence)

Sam Wilson: You must miss the good old days, huh?

Steve Rogers: Well, things aren't so bad. Food's a lot better, we used to boil everything. No polio is good. Internet, so helpful. I've been reading that a lot trying to catch up.

(Sam looks up to think and raises finger)

Sam Wilson: Marvin Gaye, 1972, "Trouble Man" soundtrack. Everything you've missed jammed into one album.

Steve Rogers: I'll put it on the list.

(Steve gets his small notebook and pen out and notes it down on his list which also includes - in the American version of the movie - I Love Lucy (Television); Moon Landing; Berlin Wall (Up + Down) Steve Jobs (Apple); Disco; Thai Food; Star Wars/Trek (with Star Wars crossed out, indicating that he has seen it); Nirvana (Band); Rocky (Rocky II?)

(Steve gets a text message: "Mission alert. Extraction imminent. Meet at the curb. :)")

Steve Rogers: Alright, Sam, duty calls. Thanks for the run. If that's what you wanna call running.

(They shake hands.)

Sam Wilson: Oh, that's how it is?

Steve Rogers: Oh, that's how it is.

Sam Wilson: (He laughs.) Okay. Any time you wanna stop by the VA, make me look awesome in front of the girl at the front desk, just let me know.

Steve Rogers: I'll keep it in mind.

Sam Wilson: Okay.

(Just then Natasha pulls up in her car by the curb and rolls down the window.)

Natasha Romanoff: Hey, fellas. Either one of you know where the Smithsonian is? I'm here to pick up a fossil.

Steve Rogers: That's hilarious.

(Steve walks over to her car and gets in, Sam gives Natasha and her car an appreciative look.)

Sam Wilson: How you doing?

Natasha Romanoff: Hey.

Steve Rogers: Can't run everywhere.

Sam Wilson: No, you can't.

(He watches as Natasha quickly pulls away and drives off.)

(flying over the Indian Ocean the duo are with SHIELD agents, led by Brock Rumlow.)

Brock Rumlow: The target is a mobile satellite launch platform: The Lemurian Star. They were sending up their last payload when pirates took them, 93 minutes ago.

Steve Rogers: Any demands?

Brock Rumlow: A billion and a half.

Steve Rogers: Why so steep?

Brock Rumlow: Because it SHIELD's.

Steve Rogers: So it's not off-course, it's trespassing.

Natasha Romanoff: I'm sure they have a good reason.

Steve Rogers: You know, I'm getting a little tired of being Fury's janitor.

Natasha Romanoff: Relax, it's not that complicated.

Steve Rogers: How many pirates?

Brock Rumlow: Twenty-five, top mercs, led by this guy. Georges Batroc.

(He shows them a photo of Batroc on the monitor.)

Brock Rumlow: Ex-DGSE, Action Division. He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice. Before the French demobilized him, he had thirty-six kill missions. This guy's got a rep for maximum casualties.

Steve Rogers: Hostages?

Brock Rumlow: Uh...mostly techs. One officer, Jasper Sitwell.

(He pulls up Sitwell's photo on the monitor.)

Brock Rumlow: They're in the galley.

Steve Rogers: What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship? Alright, I'm gonna sweep the deck and find Batroc. Nat, you'll kill the engines and wait for instructions. Rumlow, you sweep aft, find the hostages, get them to the life-pods, get 'em out. Let's move.
Brock Rumlow: STRIKE, you heard the Cap. Gear up.
[as they are getting ready to dive off the jet; into his radio]
Steve Rogers: [talking into his wrist communicator] Secure channel seven.
Natasha Romanoff: Seven secure. Did you do anything fun Saturday night?
Steve Rogers: Well, all the guys from my barbershop quartet are dead, so... No, not really.
Pilot: [on radio] Coming up by the drop zone, Cap.
Natasha Romanoff: You know, if you ask Kristen out, from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.
Steve Rogers: That's why I don't ask.
Natasha Romanoff: Too shy or too scared?
Steve Rogers: Too busy!
[Steve jumps out of the jet]
STRIKE Agent: Was he wearing a parachute?
[Rumlow smiles]
Brock Rumlow: No. No, he wasn't.
[after jumping out the jet Steve dives into the ocean and then climbs onto the ship, he then beats everyone on the deck swiftly before anyone raises the alarm when he's interrupted by one of the pirates pointing his gun at him]
French Pirate #1: Bouge pas! Bouge pas. (Don't move! Don't move.)
[he's shot dead by Rumlow as he parachutes down onto the deck behind Steve]
Steve Rogers: Thanks.
Brock Rumlow: Yeah. You seemed pretty helpless without me.
[Natasha and another agent parachute down onto the deck to join them]
Natasha Romanoff: What about the nurse that lives across the hall from you? She seems kind of nice.
Steve Rogers: Secure the engine room, then find me a date.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm multitasking.
(Natasha Jumps down to the lower deck)
[below deck we see the pirates are holding the ship's crew, including Sitwell, hostage]
French Pirate #1: J'ai dit à Batroc que si on veut que le SHIELD nous paye, commence à leur envoyer des corps maintenant ! ([subtitled] I said to Batroc, if we want SHIELD to pay, we have to start sending them bodies now!) [to the hostages]. Une balle pour quelqu'un ([subtitled] I have a bullet for someone). [shouting in English] You want a bullet in your head?! T'en veux une. Hein ! (Do you want one? Eh?) [he kicks one of the hostage's leg]. Bouge ton pied. Tu veux une balle dans la tête ? ([subtitled] Move that leg. Want a bullet in your head?)
[meanwhile on the deck Steve moves quickly to find the hostages; in the control room]
Georges Batroc: J'aime pas attendre. Appelle Durand. Je veux que l'on s'arrache dès que la ranson arrive. ([subtitled] I do not like to wait. Call Durand. I want the ship ready to move when the ransom arrives.)
French Pirate: Oui, Batroc ([subtitled] Yes, Batroc.)
[he makes the call]
French Pirate: Durand. Démarre le moteur.([subtitled] Durand. Start the engine.)
Durand: Okay.
[Durand puts the phone down, turns and sees Natasha behind him]
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, sailor.
[she quickly knocks him down and manages to swing down below deck shooting several of the pirates on the way]
[to one of the hostages]
French Pirate: Ferme ta gueule ! ([subtitled] Shut up.)
French Pirate #1: Bouge pas toi ! Mais qu'est ce qui se passe ! Tu veux jouer les héros, c'est ça ! T'as pas intérêt ! ([subtitled] What is it? Want to be a hero?)
[he looks at the hostages who keep their heads down]
French Pirate #1: Bon, j'ai trop attendu là. ([subtitled] Well, I've waited long enough.)
[he goes over to the locked door and bangs on it to get the attention of the pirate guarding outside]
French Pirate #1: Hé, trouve Batroc, si j'ai pas de nouvelles dans deux minutes, je commence à les tuer. ([subtitled] Hey, look for Batroc. If I do not hear anything in two minutes, I'll start to kill them!)
French Pirate #2: D'accord. Je vais le chercher ! ([subtitled] Okay. I'll find him!)
[as the pirate turns to leave Rumlow, who's standing behind him with a stun gun, shoots him, on the other side of the door the other pirate senses something but dismisses it]
French Pirate #1: Deux minutes. ([subtitled] Two minutes.)
[we see Rumlow and another STRIKE Agent places a bomb on the locked door]
[in the control room]
French Pirate: Silence radio du SHIELD, Batroc. ([subtitled] Radio silence from SHIELD, Batroc.)
[Steve watches them from the deck, we see another STRIKE agent getting in position]
STRIKE Agent: Targets acquired.
[below deck Rumlow points his gun at the bomb placed against door where the hostages are being kept]
Brock Rumlow: STRIKE in position.
[into his radio]
Steve Rogers: Natasha, what's your status?
[we see Natasha jumping down below deck to knock out one of the pirates]
Steve Rogers: Status, Natasha?
Natasha Romanoff: Hang on!
[as the pirate attacks her she quickly knocks him out; into her radio]
Natasha Romanoff: Engine room secure.
[Natasha grabs a pipe from the ground and knocks out one of the pirates]
French Pirate #1: Le temps est écoulé. Qui veut mourrir en premier. Hé toi ! Prend la fille. [subtitled] Time's up. Who wants to die first? [to one of his men] Hey, you! Take the girl.
[into his radio]
Steve Rogers: On my mark. Three. Two. One.
[the STRIKE team start shooting at the pirates, blow open the door and Rumlow quickly kills the head pirate]
Jasper Sitwell: I told you, SHIELD doesn't negotiate.
[back in the control room one of Batroc's men tries to get hold of the pirate below deck]
French Pirate: Halo ? Je pense que la ligne est morte.J'ai perdu le contact. ([subtitled] Hello? Batroc, the line is dead. I lost contact with them.)
[just then Steve smashes in through the window using his shield but Batroc manages to escape]
[to Steve as he goes looking for Batroc]
Brock Rumlow: Hostages en route to extraction. Romanoff missed the rendezvous point, Cap. Hostiles are still in play.
Steve Rogers: Natasha, Batroc's on the move. Circle back to Rumlow and protect the hostages.
[there's no reply from Natasha]
Steve Rogers: Natasha!
[suddenly Batroc attacks Steve, they fight on the deck of the ship, with Batroc getting quickly back up on his feet]
Georges Batroc: Je croyais que tu étais plus qu'un bouclier. ([subtitled:] I thought that you were more than just a shield.)
[Steve puts the shield on his back and takes off his mask]
Steve Rogers: On va voir. ([subtitled:] Let's see.)
[they start fighting again, Steve manages to finally knock Batroc down by smashing through into one of the rooms where Natasha is downloading something from the computer]
Natasha Romanoff: Well, this is awkward.
Steve Rogers: What are you doing?
Natasha Romanoff: Backing up the hard drive. It's a good habit to get into.
Steve Rogers: Rumlow needed your help. What the hell are you doing here?
[Steve goes over to Natasha and looks at what Natasha is backing up]
Steve Rogers: You're saving SHIELD Intel.
Natasha Romanoff: Whatever I can get my hands on.
Steve Rogers: Our mission is to rescue hostages.
Natasha Romanoff: No. That's your mission.
[she finishes backing up and pulls the flash drive out]
Natasha Romanoff: And you've done it beautifully.
[as Natasha goes to leave Steve grabs her arm]
Steve Rogers: You just jeopardized this whole operation.
Natasha Romanoff: I think that's overstating things.
[suddenly Batroc rises and throws a grenade at the two as he runs off, Steve deflects the bomb with his shield, grabs Natasha and jumps through a window before it explodes]
Natasha Romanoff: Okay. That one's on me.
Steve Rogers: You're damn right.
[The Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters; Steve walks into Fury's office]
Steve Rogers: You just can't stop yourself from lying, can you?
Nick Fury: I didn't lie. Agent Romanoff had a different mission than yours.
Steve Rogers: Which you didn't feel obliged to share.
Nick Fury: I'm not obliged to do anything.
Steve Rogers: Those hostages could've died, Nick.
Nick Fury: I sent the greatest soldier in history to make sure that didn't happen.
Steve Rogers: Soldiers trust each other, that's what makes it an army. Not a bunch of guys running around and shooting guns.
Nick Fury: The last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye. Look, I didn't want you doing anything you weren't comfortable with. Agent Romanoff is comfortable with everything.
Steve Rogers: I can't lead a mission when the people I'm leading have missions of their owns.
Nick Fury: It's called compartmentalization. Nobody spills the secrets because nobody knows them all.
Steve Rogers: Except you.
Nick Fury: You're wrong about me. I do share. I'm nice like that.
[Fury steps into an elevator with Steve following behind him]
Nick Fury: Insight bay.
SHIELD Computer: Captain Rogers does not have clearance for Project Insight.
Nick Fury: Director override, Fury, Nicholas J.
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.
[the elevator starts moving down]
Steve Rogers: You know, they used to play music.
Nick Fury: Yeah. My grandfather operated one of these things for forty years. My granddad worked in a nice building, he got good tips.
[Nick looks up]
Nick Fury:He'd walk home every night, roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag. He'd say "hi", people would say hi back. Time went on, neighborhood got rougher. He'd say "Hi", they'd say, "Keep on steppin'. Granddad got to grippin' that lunch bag a little tighter.
Steve Rogers: Did he ever get mugged?
Nick Fury: Every week some punk would say, "What's in the bag?"
Steve Rogers: What did he do?
Nick Fury: He'd show 'em. Bunch of crumpled ones and loaded .22 Magnum.
[Fury smiles]
Nick Fury: Granddad loved people. But he didn't trust them very much.
[as they continue to ride down the elevator Steve notices the giant Helicarriers]
Nick Fury: Yeah, I know. They're a little bit bigger than a .22.
[as Fury shows Steve round]
Nick Fury: This is Project Insight. Three next generation Helicarriers synced to a network of targeting satellites.
Steve Rogers: Launched from the Lemurian Star.
Nick Fury: Once we get them in the air they never need to come down. Continuous suborbital flight courtesy of our new repulsor engines.
Steve Rogers: Stark?
Nick Fury: Well, he had a few suggestions once he got an up close look at our old turbines. These new long range precision guns can eliminate a thousand hostiles a minute. The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA before he steps outside his spider hole. We gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.
Steve Rogers: I thought the punishment usually came after the crime.
Nick Fury: We can't afford to wait that long.
Steve Rogers: Who's "we"?
Nick Fury: After New York, I convinced the World Security Council we needed a quantum surge in threat analysis. For once we're way ahead of the curve.
Steve Rogers: By holding a gun at everyone on Earth and calling it protection.
Nick Fury: You know, I read those SSR files. Greatest generation? You guys did some nasty stuff.
Steve Rogers: Yeah, we compromised. Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well. But we did it so the people could be free. This isn't freedom, this is fear.
Nick Fury: SHIELD takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be. It's getting damn near past time for you to get with that program, Cap.
Steve Rogers: Don't hold your breath.
[Steve turns and walks off]
[Steve takes off on his motorcycle; in the Smithsonian Museum there is an exhibit dedicated to Captain America]
The Smithsonian Narrator: A symbol to the nation. A hero to the world. The story of Captain America is one of honor, bravery and sacrifice.
[Steve, keeping his face hidden under a baseball cap, walks over to the exhibition]
Woman on PA: (faintly) Welcome to the Smithsonian. Visitor information booths are available on the second level.
The Smithsonian Narrator: Denied enlistment due to poor health, Steven Rogers was chosen for a program unique in the annals of American warfare. One that would transform him into the world's first super soldier.
[a boy recognizes him, Steve smiles puts his finger against his mouth to indicate for the boy to keep quiet and the boy nods, Steve then watches some old footage of himself]
Old Footage Recording: In this rare footage, everyone's favorite war hero, Captain America...
[Steve goes to the display where there are mannequins with costumes of Steve's old commando squad]
The Smithsonian Narrator: Battle tested, Captain America and his Howling Commandos quickly earned their stripes. Their mission, taking down HYDRA, the Nazi rogue science division.
[Steve walks over to the a display of his friend Bucky Barnes]
The Smithsonian Narrator: Best friends since childhood, Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers were inseparable on both schoolyard and battlefield. Barnes is the only Howling Commando to give his life in service of his country.
[Steve watches an older looking Peggy Carter being interviewed]
Peggy Carter: That was a difficult winter. A blizzard had trapped half our battalion behind the German line. Steve...
(Peggy hesitates)
Peggy Carter: Captain Rogers, he fought his way through a HYDRA blockade that had pinned our allies down for months. He saved over a thousand men, including the man who would...who would become my husband as it turned out. Even after he died, Steve was still changing my life.
[Steve looks at the photo of Peggy he'd kept in his old compass]
[Steve visits Peggy, who is now lying sick in bed]
Steve Rogers: You should be proud of yourself, Peggy.
[Steve looks at Peggy's family photos by her bedside table showing her with her husband and children]
Peggy Carter: Mm. I have lived a life. My only regret is that you didn't get to live yours.
[Steve looks sad]
Peggy Carter: What is it?
Steve Rogers: For as long as I can remember I just wanted to do what was right. I guess I'm not quite sure what that is anymore. And I thought I could throw myself back in and follow orders, serve. It's just not the same.
[Peggy chuckles]
Peggy Carter: You're always so dramatic. Look, you saved the world. We rather...mucked it up.
Steve Rogers: You didn't. Knowing that you helped found SHIELD is half the reason I stay.
[Peggy takes Steve's hand]
Peggy Carter: Hey. The world has changed and none of us can go back. All we can do is our best, and sometimes the best that we can do is to start over.
[Peggy starts to cough, Steve turns to get her some water and goes to hand it to her]
Steve Rogers: Peggy.
[suddenly Peggy looks at Steve like she's seeing for the first time since he was frozen]
Peggy Carter: Steve?
Steve Rogers: Yeah.
Peggy Carter: You're alive! You...you came, you came back.
Steve Rogers: Yeah, Peggy.
[Peggy begins to cry]
Peggy Carter: It's been so long. So long.
Steve Rogers: Well, I couldn't leave my best girl. Not when she owes me a dance.
[Fury is alone in his office; to his voice controlled computer]
Nick Fury: Secure office.
[all the windows are blackened, Fury takes out the flash drive Natasha had downloaded all the files from the the Lemurian Star and places it in his computer]
Nick Fury: Open Lemurian Star's satellite launch file.
SHIELD Computer: Access denied.
Nick Fury: Run decryption.
SHIELD Computer: Decryption failed.
Nick Fury: Director override, Fury, Nicholas J.
SHIELD Computer: Override denied. All files sealed.
Nick Fury: On whose authority?
SHIELD Computer: Fury, Nicholas J.
[Fury looks confused and worried]
[Fury enters elevator]
Nick Fury: World Security Council.
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.
[Alexander Pierce is holding a virtual meeting with the World Security Council]
Councilman Rockwell: If Nick Fury thinks he can get his costumed thugs and STRIKE commandos to mop-up his mess, he's sadly mistaken. This failure is unacceptable.
Councilman Singh: Well, considering this attack took place one mile from my country's sovereign waters, it's a bit more then that. I move for immediate hearing.
Councilwoman Hawley: We don't need hearings, we need action. It's this Council's duty to oversee SHIELD.
Councilman Yen: A breach like this raises serious questions.
Councilman Rockwell: Like how the hell did a French pirate manage to hijack a covert SHIELD vessel in broad daylight?
Alexander Pierce: For the record, councilman, he's Algerian. I can draw a map if it'll help.
Councilman Rockwell: I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce. But this Council take things like international piracy fairly seriously.
Alexander Pierce: Really? I don't. I don't care about one boat, I care about the fleet. If this Council is going to fall a rancor every time someone pushes us on the playing field, maybe we need someone to oversee us.
Councilman Yen: Mr. Secretary, nobody is suggesting...
[they are interrupted by Pierce's assistant walking in and whispering something to Pierce; to the council]
Alexander Pierce: Excuse me.
Councilman Rockwell: More trouble, Mr. Secretary?
Alexander Pierce: It depends on your definition.
[the meeting ends as Pierce leaves]
Alexander Pierce: I work forty floors away and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?
Nick Fury: A nuclear war would do it too.
[they shake hands; referring to Pierce's meeting with the World Security Council]
Nick Fury: Busy in there?
Alexander Pierce: Nothing some earmarks can't fix.
Nick Fury: I'm, uh...here to ask a favor. I want you to call for a vote. Project insight has to be delayed.
Alexander Pierce: Nick, that's not a favor, that's a subcommittee hearing. A long one.
Nick Fury: It could be nothing, probably is nothing. I just need time to make sure it's nothing.
Alexander Pierce: What if it's something?
Nick Fury: Then we'll both be damn glad those Helicarriers aren't in the air.
[Pierce hesitates a moment before replying]
Alexander Pierce: Fine. But you gotta get Iron Man to stop by my niece's birthday party.
[Nick shakes his hand]
Nick Fury: Thank you, sir.
Alexander Pierce: And not just a flyby, he's got to mingle.
[Pierce turns and leaves]
[Steve goes to a PTSD group meeting where Sam is counseling other veterans]
Female War Veteran: The thing is I think it's getting worse. A cop pulled me over last week, he thought I was drunk. I swerved to miss a plastic bag. I thought it was an IED.
Sam Wilson: Some stuff you leave there, other stuff you bring back. It's our job to figure out how to carry it. Is it gonna be in a big suitcase or in a little man-purse? It's up to you.
[after the meeting ends Steve waits for Sam as he finishes saying goodbye to the veterans]
Female War Veteran: I'll see you next week.
Sam Wilson: Yeah.
Female War Veteran: Yeah. [Sam walks over to Steve]
Sam Wilson: Look who it is. The running man.
Steve Rogers: Caught the last few minutes. It's pretty intense.
Sam Wilson: Yeah, brother, we all got the same problems. Guilt, regret.
Steve Rogers: You lose someone?
Sam Wilson: My wingman, Riley. Flying a night mission.Standard PJ rescue op, nothing we hadn't done a thousand times before, till RPG knock Riley's dumb ass out of the sky. Nothing I could do. It's like I was up there just to watch.
Steve Rogers: I'm sorry.
Sam Wilson: After that, I had really hard time finding a reason for being over there, you know?
Steve Rogers: But you're happy now, back in the world?
Sam Wilson: Hey, the number of people giving me orders is down to about zero. So, hell, yeah. You thinking about getting out?
Steve Rogers: No. I don't know. To be honest, I don't know what I would do with myself if I did.
Sam Wilson: Ultimate fighting? [Steve laughs] It's just a great idea off the top of my head. But seriously, you could do whatever you want to do. What makes you happy?
Steve Rogers: I don't know.
[as Fury drives through the city he instructs his car computer to make a call]
Fury's Car: Activating communications encryption protocol.
Nick Fury: Open secure line zero-four-zero-five.
Fury's Car: Confirmed.
Maria Hill: This is Hill.
Nick Fury: I need you here in D.C. Deep shadow conditions.
Maria Hill: Give me four hours.
Nick Fury: You have three, over. [Fury stops at a red traffic light, he looks over to the next car and sees the two police officers in the car look at him with suspicion] Want to see my lease? [the policemen quickly sound their police horn once before they start to drive off, as Fury goes to drive off suddenly another police car smashes into his car, his car is then surrounded by several other police cars crashing into him; inside his car Fury is injured]
Fury's Car: Fracture detected. Recommend anesthetic injection. [as Fury is giving himself the injection a SWAT team truck pulls up] D.C. Metro Police dispatch shows no units in this area. [Fury is surrounded by the police and SWAT team, he quickly realizes they are all disguised mercenaries; to his car computer]
Nick Fury: Get me out of here! [the mercenaries suddenly start shooting at Fury's car]
Fury's Car: Propulsion systems offline.
Nick Fury: Then reboot, dammit! [the armor on Fury's vehicle starts to become weaker, the mercenaries bring out a battering ram to break in]
Fury's Car: Warning! Window integrity compromised.
Nick Fury: You think? How long to propulsion?
Fury's Car: Calculating. [the mercenaries start to use the battering ram on Fury's car window] Window Integrity thiry-one percent. Deploying countermeasures.
Nick Fury: Hold that order! [the batterring ram is smashed against the car window again]
Fury's Car: Window Integrity nineteen percent. Offensive measures advised.
Nick Fury: Wait! [the battering ram is smashed against the window again]
Fury's Car: Window Integrity one percent.
Nick Fury: Now! [suddenly a minigun pulls up from inside the car and Fury uses it to return fire on the mercenaries causing the SWAT truck and some of the police cars to explode]
Fury's Car: Propulsion systems now online.
Nick Fury: Full acceleration, now! [as he continues to fire at the mercenaries Fury's car automatically backs up and drives off] Initiate vertical takeoff!
Fury's Car: Flight systems damaged.
Nick Fury: Then activate guidance cameras! [Fury goes over into the drivers seat] Give me the wheel! [Fury takes over driving his car as the mercenaries chase after him in their police cars] Get me Agent Hill.
Fury's Car: Communications array damaged.
Nick Fury: Well, what's not damaged?
Fury's Car: Air conditioning is fully operational. [the police cars continue to chase after Fury as he weaves through the cars on the road] Traffic ahead.
Nick Fury: Give me an alternate route.
Fury's Car: Traffic alert on Roosevelt Bridge. All vehicles stopped. 17th Avenue clear in three blocks, directly ahead. [as Fury heads into the traffic he smashes into some cars causing a pile up which stops the police cars, the mercenaries get out and start shooting at Fury's car, Fury manages to kill two of the mercenaries by running them down before getting past the traffic, but the remaining mercenaries continue to chase after him and manage to sandwich Fury's vehicle between them] Warning, approaching intersection. [as they approach the intersection Fury manages to shake off the two police cars, killing off the mercenaries]
Nick Fury: Get me off the grid!
Fury's Car: Calculating route to secure location. [Fury sees a mysterious figure emerge ahead which suddenly shoots a bomb that attaches itself to Fury's vehicle causing it to explode and flip over; trapped inside his car, Fury watches as the figure walks over to the car but he manages to escape just in time by using a laser weapon to burn a hole out.]
[As Steve is walking to his apartment his hears his pretty neighbor talking on the phone as she goes to do her laundry]
Sharon Carter: That's so sweet. That is so nice. Hey. I gotta go, though. Okay, bye. [turning to Steve] My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac. [Steve smiles at her] Yeah.
Steve Rogers: Hey, if you want...if you want, you're welcome to use my machine. Might be cheaper than the one in the basement.
Sharon Carter: Oh, yeah? What's it cost?
Steve Rogers: A cup of coffee?
Sharon Carter: Thank you, but um...I already have a load in downstairs, and, uh...you really don't want my scrubs in your machine. I'm just finished orientation in the infectious diseases ward, so.
Steve Rogers: Ah, well, I'll keep my distance.
Sharon Carter: Well hopefully not too far. [Steve nods and turns to go into his apartment] Oh, and I think you left your stereo on.
Steve Rogers: Oh. Right, thank you.
Sharon Carter: Yeah. [Steve watches her go down the stairs before turning in suspicion to his door]
[Steve hears music as he cautiously enters his apartment though the window, he grabs his shield for protection and finds Fury sitting on his couch in the dark]
Steve Rogers: I don't remember giving you a key.
Nick Fury: You really think I'd need one? My wife kicked me out.
Steve Rogers: Didn't know you were married.
Nick Fury: A lot of things you don't about me.
Steve Rogers: I know, Nick. That's the problem. [as Steve turns on the light he notices Fury's injuries for the first time, but Fury indicates for him to be silent, he turns off the light and writes something on his phone and shows it to Steve; "ears everywhere"]
Nick Fury: I'm sorry to have to do this, but I had no place else to crash. [he writes another text and shows it to Steve; "SHIELD compromised"]
Steve Rogers: Who else knows about your wife? [Fury shows him another text; "You and me"]
Nick Fury: Just...my friends.
Steve Rogers: Is that what we are?
Nick Fury: That's up to you. [suddenly Fury is shot three times from through the wall and collapses, Steve looks out the window for the shooter then he quickly drags Fury to the next room, before he leaves Fury hands him the flash drive] Don't...trust anyone. [Fury passes out] [Steve hears someone breaking into his apartment and hears his neighbor calling out to him]
Sharon Carter: Captain Rogers? [Steve sees her walking in with her gun pointed] Captain, I'm Agent 13 of SHIELD Special Service.
Steve Rogers: Kate?
Sharon Carter: I'm assigned to protect you.
Steve Rogers: On whose order? [She notices Fury lying injured on the ground]
Sharon Carter: His. [she goes to Fury then contacts SHIELD through her radio] Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive. I need EMTs.
SHIELD Agent: Do you have a twenty on the shooter? [Steve notices the shooter though the window]
Steve Rogers: Tell him I'm in pursuit. [Steve smashes through his window and runs after the assassin, who is the same mysterious man that had exploded Fury's car, Steve chases him through an office building smashing through the walls, when he finally catches up with him on the roof he throws his shield at the assassin, but he catches it with one swift move, then throws it back to Steve and then jumps down the building and disappears.]
[Natasha goes to the hospital and meets up with Steve, they watch doctors operating on Fury]
Natasha Romanoff: Is he gonna make it?
Steve Rogers: I don't know.
Natasha Romanoff: Tell me about the shooter.
Steve Rogers: He's fast and strong. Had a metal arm. [just then Agent Maria Hill also joins them]
Natasha Romanoff: Ballistics?
Maria Hill: Three slugs, no rifling. Completely untraceable.
Natasha Romanoff: Soviet-made.
Maria Hill: Yeah. [suddenly they watch in shock as Fury's state deteriorates]
Male Nurse: He's in V-tach.
Female Nurse: Crash cart coming in.
Doctor: Nurse, help me with the drape.
Male Nurse: BP is dropping.
Doctor: Defibrillator! [Steve, Natasha and Hill watch in shock as Fury is flatlining] I want you to charge him at one hundred.
Natasha Romanoff: Don't do this to me, Nick.
Doctor: Stand back! Three, two, one. Clear! [Fury is given a shock with the defibrillator] Pulse?
Male Nurse: No pulse.
Doctor #1: No pulse.
Doctor: Okay. 200, please. Stand back! Three, two, one. Clear! [Fury is given another shock] Give me epinephrine! Pulse?
Male Nurse: Negative.
Natasha Romanoff: Don't do this to me, Nick. Don't do this to me. [the three watch the doctors as they continue to revive Fury but Fury is still showing as flatlining, Steve turns away as they finally call his time of death]
Doctor: What's the time?
Female Nurse: 1:03, Doctor.
Doctor: Time of death, 1:03 a.m. [Steve looks down at the flash drive Fury had given him]
[Natasha and Steve are in a room where Fury's dead body has been laid out, Natasha is looking at Fury's body with tears running down her face, Hill joins them]
Maria Hill: I need to take him. [Steve goes over to Natasha]
Steve Rogers: Natasha. [she doesn't respond, instead she tenderly touches Fury's head then turns and walks out, Steve follows her] Natasha!
Natasha Romanoff: Why was Fury in your apartment?
Steve Rogers: I don't know. [they are interrupted by Rumlow]
Brock Rumlow: Cap, they want you back at SHIELD.
Steve Rogers: Yeah, give me a second.
Brock Rumlow: They want you now.
Steve Rogers: Okay. [Steven turns to Natasha]
Natasha Romanoff: You're a terrible liar. [she turns and walks off]
Jasper Sitwell: [on earpiece] STRIKE team, escort Captain Rogers back to SHIELD immediately for questioning.
Brock Rumlow: I told him. [Steve notices the vending machine next to him, we then see Steve walking towards Rumlow]
Steve Rogers: Let's go.
Brock Rumlow: Yeah. [to the agents] STRIKE, move it out. [as they leave we see that Steve has hid the flash drive behind a pack of gums in the vending machine]
[back at SHIELD, Steve is brought to Pierce who is talking to Agent 13]
Alexander Pierce: For whatever it's worth, you did your best.
Sharon Carter: Thank you, sir. [as she turns to leave she sees Steve] Captain Rogers. [Steve replies coldly as he walks towards Pierce]
Steve Rogers: Neighbor.
Alexander Pierce: Ah, Captain. I'm Alexander Pierce.
Steve Rogers: Sir, it's an honor. [they shake hands]
Alexander Pierce: The honor is mine, Captain. My father served in the 101st. Come on in. [they enter Pierce's office where he shows Steve an old photo of Fury with Pierce] That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met. When I was at State Department in Bogota. ELN rebels took the embassy, and security got me out, but the rebels took hostages. Nick was deputy chief for the SHIELD station there. And he comes to me with a plan. He wants to storm the building through the sewers. I said, "No, we'll negotiate." Turned out the ELN didn't negotiate, so they put out a kill order. They stormed the basement, and what did they find? They find it empty. Nick had ignored my direct order and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil. He saved the lives of a dozen political officers, including my daughter.
Steve Rogers: So you gave him a promotion.
Alexander Pierce: I've never had any cause to regret it. Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night?
Steve Rogers: I don't know.
Alexander Pierce: You know it was bugged?
Steve Rogers: I did, because Nick told me.
Alexander Pierce: Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it? [Steve doesn't reply obviously not knowing this information] I want you to see something. [he brings up footage of Batroc being interrogated]
SHIELD Agent: Who hired you, Batroc?
Steve Rogers: Is that live?
Alexander Pierce: Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.
Steve Rogers: Are you saying he's a suspect? Assassination isn't Batroc's line.
Alexander Pierce: No, it's more complicated than that. Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star and he was contacted by e-mail and paid by wire transfer. And then the money was run through seventeen fictitious accounts, the last one going to a holding company that was registered to a Jacob Veech.
Steve Rogers: Am I supposed to know who that is? [he hands Steve the file]
Alexander Pierce: Not likely. Veech died six years ago. His last address was 14-35 Elmhurst Drive. When I first met Nick his mother lived at 14-37.
Steve Rogers: Are you saying Fury hired the pirates? Why?
Alexander Pierce: The prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence. The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.
Steve Rogers: If you really knew Nick Fury you'd know that's not true.
Alexander Pierce: Why do you think we're talking? See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to, because we were both realists. We knew that despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, that to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down. And that makes enemies. Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better. And the idea that those people could be happy today, makes me really, really angry. [he hesitates a moment] Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive. I don't think that's an accident, and I don't think you do either. So I'm gonna ask again, why was he there?
Steve Rogers: He told me not to trust anyone.
Alexander Pierce: I wonder if that included him. [Steve pauses a moment before replying]
Steve Rogers: I'm sorry. Those were his last words. Excuse me. [Steve picks up his shield, places it on his back and starts to make his out of the office]
Alexander Pierce: Captain. [Steve stops and looks at Pierce] Somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why. Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it. Anyone.
Steve Rogers: Understood. [Steve turns and leaves]
Steve Rogers: [after he leaves Pierce's office he steps into the elevator] Operations control.
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed. [just as the elevator doors are about to close Rumlow steps in with two STRIKE agents]
Brock Rumlow: Keep all STRIKE personnel on site.
STRIKE Agent #1: Understood.
STRIKE Agent #2: Yes, sir.
Brock Rumlow: Forensics.
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.
Brock Rumlow: Cap.
Steve Rogers: Rumlow. [the elevator doors close and they start riding down]
Brock Rumlow: Evidence Response found some fibres on the roof they want us to see. You want me to get the tac-team ready?
Steve Rogers: No, lets wait and see what it is first.
Brock Rumlow: Right. [Steve notices one of the agents touching his weapon suspiciously] [the elevator stops and more SHIELD and STRIKE agents enter]
SHIELD Agent #1: What's the status so far?
SHIELD Agent #2: Administrations level.
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.
SHIELD Agent #2: [to Steve] Excuse me.
Brock Rumlow: [to Steve] I'm sorry about what happened with Fury. Messed up, what happened to him.
Steve Rogers: Thank you. [feeling something is off, Steve looks at the agents in the elevator and notices one of them is sweating, then the elevator stops and more agents enter]
STRIKE Agent #3: Records.
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed. [as the elevator doors close Steve realizes he's been surrounded by agents]
Steve Rogers: Before we get started, does anyone want to get out? [there's a moment's pause before suddenly one of the agents turns and uses an electric rod to give Steve a shock, the others grab him and try to strap his wrists with magnetic cuffs, Steve manages to knock some of them down but one cuff remains, then Rumlow uses his rod to give Steve a shock] [as Steve is being attacked we see Sitwell in a controls room watching them from a monitor]
Jasper Sitwell: Mobilize STRIKE units, 25th floor. [Steve manages free himself from the magnetic cuff and knock all the agents down, he turns to Rumlow]
Brock Rumlow: Whoa, big guy. I just want you to know, Cap, this ain't personal. [Rumlow then goes to attack Steve with his electric rod but Steve manages to defend himself and eventually knocks Rumlow out]
Steve Rogers: It kind of feels personal. [Steve picks up his shield then opens the elevator doors, but he's faced by a team of STRIKE agents pointing their weapons at him]
25th Floor STRIKE Agent: Drop the shield! Put your hands in the air! [Steve uses his shield to break off the elevator wires which sends the elevator down, as he forces the doors open he sees more STRIKE agents approaching him, he closes the door and looks for a way out]
STRIKE Agent: Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open! You have nowhere to go! [Steve breaks through the glass in the elevator and plummets down to finally hit the ground floor, from his monitor Sitwell watches in shock as Steve gets up and starts running off]
Jasper Sitwell: Are you kidding me? [ordering the STRIKE team] He's headed for the garage. Lock down the bridge! [Steve rides out of the SHIELD garage on his motorcycle, evading the obstacles laid out but then a Quinjet emerges ahead of him]
Quinjet Pilot: Stand down, Captain Rogers. Stand down. [the Quinjet lowers its machine gun] Repeat, stand down. [as Steve doesn't stop they start shooting at him, Steve throws his shield into the propellers to jam it, giving him an opportunity to hop onto it and do more damage to the jet with his shield before jumping off as the jet goes crashing down and he escapes]
Jasper Sitwell: [to the SHIELD agents] Eyes here. [everyone, including Agent 13, looks at Sitwell] Whatever your op is, bury it. This is Level One. Contact DOT. All traffic lights in the district go red. Shut all runways at BWI, IAD and Reagan. All security cameras in the city go through this monitor, right here. Scan all open sources. Phones, computers, PDAs, whatever. If someone tweets about this guy, I want to know about it.
Sharon Carter: With all due respect, If SHIELD is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why.
Alexander Pierce: Because he lied to us. [Pierce enters the room] Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury, he refused to share it. As difficult as this is to accept, Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD.
[disguised as a civilian dressed in a hoody, Steve goes back to the hospital to retrieve the flash drive from the vending machine but sees it's gone, then Natasha appears behind him chewing some gum, in anger Steve pushes her into a room]
Steve Rogers: Where is it?
Natasha Romanoff: Safe.
Steve Rogers: Do better!
Natasha Romanoff: Where did you get it?
Steve Rogers: Why would I tell you?
Natasha Romanoff: Fury gave it to you. Why?
Steve Rogers: What's on it?
Natasha Romanoff: I don't know.
Steve Rogers: Stop lying!
Natasha Romanoff: I only act like I know everything, Rogers.
Steve Rogers: I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?
Natasha Romanoff: Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.
Steve Rogers: I'm not gonna ask you again.
Natasha Romanoff: I know who killed Fury. Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists, the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier. He's credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last fifty years.
Steve Rogers: So he's a ghost story.
Natasha Romanoff: Five years ago I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran, somebody shot out my tires near Odessa. We lost control, went straight over a cliff, I pulled us out, but the Winter Soldier was there. I was covering my engineer, so he shot him straight through me. [she pulls up her shirt to show him the scar on the side of her stomach] Soviet slug, no rifling. Bye-bye bikinis.
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now. [there's a hit of a smile from Natasha]
Natasha Romanoff: Going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried. [Natasha holds up the flash drive] Like you said, he's a ghost story. [Steve takes the flash drive from her]
Steve Rogers: Well, let's find out what the ghost wants.
[Pierce is holding another virtual meeting with the World Security Council]
Alexander Pierce: Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood. To any reasonable person, that would make him a martyr, not a traitor.
Councilman Rockwell: You know what makes him a traitor? Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.
Councilman Singh: Nick Fury used your friendship to coerce this council into delaying Project Insight. A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations. At best, he lied to you. At worst...
Alexander Pierce: Are you calling for my resignation? I've got a pen and paper right here.
Councilwoman Hawley: That discussion can be tabled for a later time.
Alexander Pierce: But you do want to have a discussion.
Councilman Rockwell: We've already had it, Mr. Secretary. This council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight. If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.
[Steve and Natasha go to the mall disguised as a civilian couple]
Natasha Romanoff: First rule of going on the run is, don't run, walk.
Steve Rogers: If I run in these shoes, they're gonna fall off. [they go to a Mac store to use one of their computers]
Natasha Romanoff: The drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up SHIELD will know exactly where we are.
Steve Rogers: How much time do we have?
Natasha Romanoff: Uh...about nine minutes from... [she pops the flash drive into a MacBook Pro] Now. [we see several SHIELD vehicles heading their way] Fury was right about that ship, somebody's trying to hide something. This drive is protected by some sort of AI, it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.
Steve Rogers: Can you override it?
Natasha Romanoff: The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me. Slightly. [Rumlow and his team pull up outside the mall and head inside] [back at the Mac store, Steve and Natasha continue to try and find out what's on the flash drive] I'm gonna try running a tracer. This is a program that SHIELD developed to track hostile malware, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from.
Apple Employee: Can I help you guys with anything?
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, no. My fiancé was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations.
Steve Rogers: Right! We're getting married.
Apple Employee: Congratulations. Where do you guys thinking about going? [Steve looks at the monitor and sees the signal traced to somewhere in New Jersey]
Steve Rogers: New Jersey.
Apple Employee: Oh. [the employee looks at Steve for a moment] I have the exact same glasses.
Natasha Romanoff: Wow, you two are practically twins.
Apple Employee: Yeah, I wish. Specimen. Uh...if you guys need anything, I've been Aaron.
Steve Rogers: Thank you. [as Rumlow and his team are in the mall looking for Steve and Natasha] You said nine minutes, come on.
Natasha Romanoff: Shh, relax. Got it. [they find the signal is coming from Wheaton, NJ] You know it?
Steve Rogers: I used to. Let's go. [Steve pulls the flash drive from the computer and they walk out of the store] Standard tac-team. Two behind, to across, two coming straight at us. If they make us, I'll engage, you hit the south escalator to the metro. [as two agents are coming straight towards them]
Natasha Romanoff: Shut up and put your arm around me, laugh at something I said.
Steve Rogers: What?
Natasha Romanoff: Do it! [Steve quickly puts his arm around Natasha and laughs] [inside the Mac store one of the agents looks around]
Jack Rollins: Negative at the source.
Brock Rumlow: Give me a floor rundown.
SHIELD Agent #2: Negative on three.
SHIELD Agent #3: Negative on two.
Brock Rumlow: Snake the upper levels, work down to me. [as they are going down the escalator Natasha spots Rumlow on the escalator next to them going up, she turns to Steve]
Natasha Romanoff: Kiss me.
Steve Rogers: What?
Natasha Romanoff: Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.
Steve Rogers: Yes, they do. [she quickly pulls down Steve's head and kisses him making Rumlow look away as he goes past them on the escalator]
Natasha Romanoff: You still uncomfortable?
Steve Rogers: It's not exactly the word I would use.
[as they drive to New Jersey]
Natasha Romanoff: Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?
Steve Rogers: Nazi Germany.
Natasha Romanoff: Mm.
Steve Rogers: And we're borrowing. Take your feet off the dash. [Natasha takes her feet off the dash]
Natasha Romanoff: Alright, I have a question for you, oh, which you do not have to answer. I feel like if you don't answer it though, you're kind of answering it, you know?
Steve Rogers: What?
Natasha Romanoff: Was that your first kiss since 1945?
Steve Rogers: That bad, huh?
Natasha Romanoff: I didn't say that.
Steve Rogers: Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.
Natasha Romanoff: No, I didn't. I just wondered how much practice you've had.
Steve Rogers: You don't need practice.
Natasha Romanoff: Everybody needs practice.
Steve Rogers: It was not my first kiss since 1945. I'm ninety-five, I'm not dead.
Natasha Romanoff: Nobody special, though? [Steve chuckles]
Steve Rogers: Believe it or not, it's kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience.
Natasha Romanoff: Well, that's alright, you just make something up.
Steve Rogers: What, like you?
Natasha Romanoff: I don't know. The truth is a matter of circumstances, it's not all things to all people all the time. And neither am I.
Steve Rogers: That's a tough way to live.
Natasha Romanoff: It's a good way not to die, though.
Steve Rogers: You know, it's kind of hard to trust someone when you don't know who that someone really is.
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah. Who do you want me to be?
Steve Rogers: How about a friend? [Natasha laughs softly]
Natasha Romanoff: Well, there's a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers.
[the two pull up to outside an abandoned military base where the signal led them to]
Steve Rogers: This is it.
Natasha Romanoff: The file came from these coordinates.
Steve Rogers: So did I. [later that night as they walk around the base trying to pinpoint where the signal came from] This camp is where I was trained.
Natasha Romanoff: Changed much?
Steve Rogers: A little. [Steve has a brief visions of his former, smaller self running past him as he's getting trained with other soldiers]
Sergeant Duffy: Pick up the pace, ladies! Let's go! Let's go! Double time! Come on Rogers, move it! [his former self stops and stares at Steve as he is now] Come on! Fall in! Rogers! I said fall in! [present Steve watches nostalgically as the former Steve runs off]
Natasha Romanoff: This is a dead end. Zero heat signature, zero waves, not even radio. Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off. [Steve notices a building ahead of them] What is it? [as they walk over to the building]
Steve Rogers: Army regulations forbid storing ammunition within five hundred yards of the barracks. This building is in the wrong place. [Steve opens the lock with his shield and they enter inside, when they turn on the lights they notice it's a SHIELD office]
Natasha Romanoff: This is SHIELD.
Steve Rogers: Maybe where it started. [they enter a room where they find old framed portraits of Howard Stark, Peggy and Col. Chester Phillips]
Natasha Romanoff: There's Stark's father.
Steve Rogers: Howard.
Natasha Romanoff: Who's the girl? [Steve doesn't reply and turns away to walk further down the room and stops by a massive book shelf]
Steve Rogers: If you're already working in a secret office... [he pushes the books shelf and slides open to reveal an elevator behind it] Why do you need to hide the elevator? [they go down the elevator which takes them to a room with old looking computers]
Natasha Romanoff: This can't be the data-point, this technology is ancient. [suddenly Natasha notices a small flash drive port, she places the flash drive in it which then activates the ancient computer in the room]
Computer: Initiate system? [Natasha types using the keyboard]
Natasha Romanoff: Y-E-S, spells yes. [Natasha smiles as the old computer starts to cranks up] "Shall we play a game?" [to Steve] It's from a movie that...
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I saw it. [suddenly they hear an accented voice speaking]
Dr. Arnim Zola: Rogers, Steven. Born, 1918. Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna. Born, 1984. [they see an old camera moving above them as it analyzes them]
Natasha Romanoff: It's some kind of a recording.
Dr. Arnim Zola: I am not a recording, Fräulein. I may not be the man I was when the Captain took me prisoner in 1945, but I am. [the computer screen shows an old photo of Dr. Arnim Zola]
Natasha Romanoff: Do you know this thing?
Steve Rogers: Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull. He's been dead for years.
Dr. Arnim Zola: First correction, I am Swiss. Second, look around you. I have never been more alive. In 1972 I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body, my mind, however, that was worth saving on two hundred thousand feet of data banks. You are standing in my brain.
Steve Rogers: How did you get here?
Dr. Arnim Zola: Invited.
Natasha Romanoff: It was Operation Paperclip after World War II. SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic value.
Dr. Arnim Zola: They thought I could help their cause. I also helped my own.
Steve Rogers: HYDRA died with the Red Skull.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Cut off one head, two more shall take its place.
Steve Rogers: Prove it.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Accessing archive. [the computer screen shows them old footage of Johann Schmidt/Red Skull, of the how the original SHIELD founders] HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly. After the war, SHIELD was founded and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew. A beautiful parasite inside SHIELD. For seventy years HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war. And when history did not cooperate, history was changed.
Natasha Romanoff: That's impossible, SHIELD would have stopped you.
Dr. Arnim Zola: Accidents will happen. [the computer screen shows them HYDRA had killed Howard and Maria Stark making it look like a car accident along with the recent death of Fury] HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security. Once the purification process is complete, HYDRA's new world order will arise. We won, Captain. Your death amounts to the same as your Life; a zero sum. [in anger Steve suddenly smashes the computer screen] As I was saying...
Steve Rogers: What's on this drive?
Dr. Arnim Zola: Project Insight requires insight. So I wrote an algorithm.
Natasha Romanoff: What kind of algorithm? What does it do?
Dr. Arnim Zola: The answer to your question is fascinating. Unfortunately, you shall be too dead to hear it. [suddenly the doors starts to close, Steve tries stops it by throwing his shield in between it but he's too late]
Natasha Romanoff: Steve, we got a bogey. Short range ballistic. 30 seconds tops.
Steve Rogers: Who fired it?
Natasha Romanoff: S.H.I.E.L.D.
Dr. Arnim Zola: I am afraid I have been stalling, Captain. Admit it, it's better this way. We're both of us...out of time. [Steve notices a small opening on the ground, he throws the metal door aside and just as the place explodes he throws himself and Natasha into the hole and protects them with his shield, he then manages to get them out from under the building rubble just as STRIKE agents arrive to roam the area for them]
Brock Rumlow: [As he notices a footprint in the dust] Call in the asset.
[at his home, Pierce goes to his kitchen to get a drink when he sees the Winter Soldier sat behind behind him with his gun on the table when his housekeeper calls out]
Renata: I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce. You need anything before I leave?
Alexander Pierce: No. Uh...it's fine, Renata, you can go home.
Renata: Okay, night-night.
Alexander Pierce: Good night. [Renata leaves] Want some milk? [the Winter Soldier doesn't reply] The timetable has moved. Our window is limited. Two targets, Level Six. [he pours himself a glass of milk and goes over to join the Winter Soldier at the table] They already cost me Zola. I want confirmed death in ten hours. [just then Renata interrupts them as she enters the kitchen]
Renata: Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...I forgot my phone. [she notices the Winter Soldier]
Alexander Pierce: Oh, Renata. I wish you would have knocked. [Pierce picks up the gun from the table and shoots and kills her]
[returning home from his morning run Sam hears a knock at his door, he opens the door to see Steve and Natasha]
Sam Wilson: Hey, man.
Steve Rogers: I'm sorry about this. We need a place to lay low.
Natasha Romanoff: Everyone we know is trying to kill us. [Sam pauses a moment before replying]
Sam Wilson: Not everyone. [Sam let's them enter, later as Steve and Natasha are cleaning up, Steve notices Natasha looking sad and thoughtful]
Steve Rogers: You okay?
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah.
Steve Rogers: What's going on?
Natasha Romanoff: When I first joined SHIELD, I thought I was going straight. But I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA. I thought I knew whose lies I was telling, but...I guess I can't tell the difference anymore.
Steve Rogers: There's a chance you might be in the wrong business. [Natasha smiles faintly]
Natasha Romanoff: I owe you.
Steve Rogers: It's okay.
Natasha Romanoff: If it was the other way around, and it was down to me to save your life, and you be honest with me, would you trust me to do it?
Steve Rogers: I would now. And I'm always honest.
Natasha Romanoff: Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing.
Steve Rogers: Well, I guess I just like to know who I'm fighting.
Sam Wilson: [to Steve and Natasha] I made breakfast. If you guys...eat that sort of thing. [later as they are sat in Sam's kitchen]
Natasha Romanoff: So, the question is: who in SHIELD could launch a domestic missile strike?
Steve Rogers: Pierce.
Natasha Romanoff: Who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world.
Steve Rogers: But he's not working alone, Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star.
Natasha Romanoff: So was Jasper Sitwell.
Steve Rogers: So, the real question is: how do the two most wanted people in Washington kidnap a SHIELD officer in broad daylight?
Sam Wilson: The answer is: you don't. [Sam drops a file in front of Steve]
Steve Rogers: What's this?
Sam Wilson: Call it a resume. [Natasha picks up a photo of Sam with his para-rescue team]
Natasha Romanoff: Is this Bakhmala? The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you. [to Steve] You didn't say he was a para-rescue. [looking at the photo of Sam with his colleague]
Steve Rogers: Is this Riley?
Sam Wilson: Yeah.
Natasha Romanoff: I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs. What did you use, a stealth chute?
Sam Wilson: No. These. [he hands Steve the file, Steve opens it and reads it]
Steve Rogers: I thought you said you were a pilot.
Sam Wilson: I never said pilot.
Steve Rogers: I can't ask you to do this, Sam. You got out for a good reason.
Sam Wilson: Dude, Captain America needs my help. There's no better reason to get back in.
Steve Rogers: Where can we get our hands on one of these things?
Sam Wilson: The last one is at Fort Meade, behind three guarded gates and a twelve-inch steel wall. [Steve looks at Natasha who shrugs her shoulders]
Steve Rogers: Shouldn't be a problem. [Steve throws down the file on the table and we see that it's a classified military project called Falcon]
[after their meeting is over Sitwell walks out of the building with Senator Stern]
Senator Stern: Listen, I gotta fly home tonight, cause uh...I got some constituency problem, and I gotta press the flesh.
Jasper Sitwell: Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator?
Senator Stern: Uh...no, not really. Twenty-three, kind of hot. Real hot. You know, wants to be a reporter, I think. I don't know, who listens at that point?
Jasper Sitwell: Doesn't sound much of a problem to me.
Senator Stern: Really? Cause she's killing my back. Look, this isn't the place to talk about it. [he touches Sitwell's pin on his jacket] This is a nice pin.
Jasper Sitwell: Thank you.
Senator Stern: Come here. [they embrace and as they do Stern whispers to Sitwell] Hail, HYDRA. [as Stern steps away he touches his back] See, it's right there...
Jasper Sitwell: I just saw that, yeah.
Senator Stern: Should I get it checked?
Jasper Sitwell: I think you should. [Stern walks away] [Sitwell gets a call from Pierce, Sitwell turns to his men] I need a minute. Bring the car around. [his men leave and Sitwell answers the phone] Yes, sir?
Sam Wilson: Agent Sitwell, how was lunch? I hear the crab cakes here are delicious.
Jasper Sitwell: Who is this?
Sam Wilson: The good looking guy in the sunglasses, your ten o'clock. [Sitwell looks around but doesn't see him] Your other ten o'clock. [Sitwell turns the other way and sees Sam sitting a few feet away from him] There you go.
Jasper Sitwell: What do you want?
Sam Wilson: You're gonna go around the corner, to your right. There's a grey car, two spaces down. You and I are gonna take a ride.
Jasper Sitwell: And why would I do that?
Sam Wilson: Because that tie looks really expensive, and I'd hate to mess it up. [Sitwell looks down at his tie and sees a small red light from the gun being pointed at him] [Steve throws Sitwell across a rooftop, Natasha follows behind him]
Steve Rogers: Tell me about Zola's algorithm.
Jasper Sitwell: Never heard of it.
Steve Rogers: What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?
Jasper Sitwell: I was throwing up, I get seasick. [Steve forces Sitwell to the edge of the rooftop, Sitwell just smiles] Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof? Because it's really not your style, Rogers.
Steve Rogers: You're right. It's not. It's hers. [Steve steps aside and Natasha kicks Sitwell off the roof, he plummets down screaming]
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, wait. What about that girl from accounting, Laura...?
Steve Rogers: Lillian. Lip piercing, right?
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, she's cute.
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I'm not ready for that. [suddenly, Sam, in his Falcon jet-pack suit with wings, flies up holding Sitwell and throws him down on the roof] [Steve and Natasha walk towards Sitwell, he holds his hand up in fear]
Jasper Sitwell: Zola's algorithm is a program...for choosing Insight's targets!
Steve Rogers: What targets?
Jasper Sitwell: You! A TV anchor in Cairo, the Undersecretary of Defense, a high school valedictorian in Iowa city. Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, anyone who's a threat to HYDRA! Now, or in the future.
Steve Rogers: The Future? How could it know? [Sitwell laughs]
Jasper Sitwell: How could it not? The 21st century is a digital book. Zola taught HYDRA how to read it. [Steve and Natasha look at him in confusion] Your bank records, medical histories, voting patterns, e-mails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores. Zola's algorithm evaluates people's past to predict their future.
Steve Rogers: And what then?
Jasper Sitwell: Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.
Steve Rogers: What then?!
Jasper Sitwell: Then the Insight Helicarriers scratch people off the list. A few million at a time.
Jasper Sitwell: [as Sam drives them to Triskelion] HYDRA doesn't like leaks.
Sam Wilson: So why don't you try sticking a cork in it.
Natasha Romanoff: Insight's launching in sixteen hours, we're cutting it a little bit close here.
Steve Rogers: I know. We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans and access the Helicarriers directly.
Jasper Sitwell: What?! Are you crazy? That is a terrible, terrible idea. [suddenly the Winter Soldier lands on the car roof, pulls Sitwell out through the window and throws him into the oncoming traffic, killing him, he then starts shooting at them until Steve pulls the break handle making the Winter Soldier drop down onto the street, as another car smashes into the trio's car and pushes them along, the Winter Soldier jumps back onto their car, smashes through the windscreen and pulls out the steering wheel]
Sam Wilson: Shit! [Natasha starts shooting at him but the Winter Soldier jumps onto the vehicle behind them, as the trio's car is being pulled off the road Steve holds on to the car door]
Steve Rogers: Hang on! [he breaks open the door, holding onto Natasha and Sam, they slide on the car door through the streets] [the Winter Soldier is joined by HYDRA agents and they start shooting at them, the trio scatter and run off in different directions with the Winter Soldier shooting at Natasha but she manages to shoot him in his eye goggle mask and run off]
Winter Soldier: Она у меня. Найди его. (She's mine. ([subtitled as:] I'll take care of her.) Find him.) [the Winter Soldier goes in pursuit of Natasha as the Hydra agents go after Steve and Sam who both manage to fend them off as they shoot at them, Steve then notices the Winter Soldier in pursuit of Natasha]
Sam Wilson: Go, I got this! [the Winter Soldier thinks he's found Natasha hiding behind a car as he can hear her voice]
Natasha Romanoff: I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block of Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes. Taking fire above and below expressway. Civilians threatened. Repeat, civilians threatened. [he rolls a bomb towards where he thinks she's hiding. As the bomb rolls behind the car we see that Natasha isn't actually there but a recording over her voice is being played back on a phone] I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block at Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes. [as the bomb explodes Natasha jumps onto the Winter Soldiers back and tries to kill him but he throws her off, she starts running off as he goes after her]
Natasha Romanoff: [to the civilians as she tries to get away from the Winter Soldier] Get out of the way! Stay out of the way! [suddenly she gets shot in the shoulder, she falls and looks around her, as the Winter Soldier comes up from behind to shoot her Steve jumps in and attacks him, they fight and in the process the Winter Soldier takes Steve's shield and throws it at him but Steve manages to avoid being hit, after battling it out more the Winter Soldier's mask comes off, as he looks around at Steve we learn the true identity of the Winter Soldier; Bucky Barnes]
Steve Rogers: Bucky?
Bucky Barnes: Who the hell is Bucky? [as Bucky goes to shoot at Steve Sam flies in and kicks Bucky aside, Bucky takes aim again but before he can shoot Natasha uses the grenade launcher Bucky dropped earlier to shoot at Bucky who vanishes in the smoke of the explosion, then the trio hear sirens after which they are surrounded by HYDRA agents being led by Rumlow]
Brock Rumlow: Drop the shield, Cap! On your knees! Get on your knees! Now! Get down! Get down! [Steve holds his hands up] Get on your knees! Down! [he kicks Steve's leg and Steve kneels down] Don't move. [Rumlow looks at the helicopter flying above them and warns Rollins who's holding Steve at gunpoint] Put the gun down. Not here. Not here! [Rollins lowers his gun, the HYDRA agents then take Steve, Sam, and Natasha into custody]
[as the trio is being escorted in a van]
Steve Rogers: It was him. He looked right at me like he didn't even know me.
Sam Wilson: How's that even possible? It was like seventy years ago.
Steve Rogers: Zola. Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43, Zola experimented on him. Whatever he did helped Bucky survive the fall. They must have found him and...
Natasha Romanoff: None of that's your fault, Steve.
Steve Rogers: Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky. [Sam notices Natasha is bleeding from her shoulder and looks at the guards]
Sam Wilson: We need to get a doctor here. We don't put pressure on that wound she's gonna bleed out here in the truck. [suddenly one of the guards pulls out an electric rod and neutralizes the other guard and knocks him out, the guard is revealed to be Hill as she takes off her helmet]
Maria Hill: Ah. That thing was squeezing my brain. [Sam looks at her in confusion; to Steve] Who's this guy? [Rumlow's crew stop their vehicles and get out]
Brock Rumlow: Three holes. Start digging. [they go over to the van holding Steve, Sam and Natasha and as they open the door they find it empty with one of the guards left unconscious and massive burnt whole on the car floor]
[Hill has taken the trio to a secret facility, a man runs towards them; referring to Natasha's wound]
Maria Hill: GSW. She's lost at least a pint.
Sam Wilson: Maybe two.
Doctor: Let me take her.
Maria Hill: She'll want to see him first. [Hill takes them to Fury who's alive and lying in bed, the trio look at him in shock]
Nick Fury: About damn time. [later as Natasha's wound is being treated] Lacerated spinal column, cracked sternum, shattered collarbone, perforated liver, one hell of a headache.
Doctor: Don't forget your collapsed lung.
Nick Fury: Oh, let's not forget that. Otherwise, I'm good.
Natasha Romanoff: They cut you open, your heart stopped.
Nick Fury: Tetrodotoxin B. Slows the pulse to one beat a minute. Banner developed it for stress. Didn't work so great for him, but we found a use for it.
Steve Rogers: Why all the secrecy? Why not just tell us?
Maria Hill: Any attempt on the director's life had to look successful.
Nick Fury: Can't kill you if you're already dead. Besides, I wasn't sure who to trust.
[inside a bank vault, the HYDRA agents fix Bucky's metal arm and as they do so he has a brief flashback to his old life after he was recovered by Zola and the HYDRA agents]
Dr. Arnim Zola: Sergeant Barnes... [he has to flashback to falling off the train at the edge of the mountain with Steve trying to save him]
Steve Rogers: Bucky, no! [he then has flashback to after he's picked up by Hydra agents]
Dr. Arnim Zola: The procedure has already started. [we see the Zola and the Hydra agent amputating his left arm and replacing with the metal arm] You are to be the new fist of HYDRA. [to his men] Put him on ice. [we see Bucky being frozen after which he comes back to the present and knocks over the HYDRA agent fixing his arm, Rollins points his gun at him to stop him attacking any further] [as Pierce enters the bank vault Bucky is being held in]
Scientist #1: Sir, he's...he's unstable. Erratic. [Pierce enters with Rumlow and some other HYDRA agents and goes over to Bucky]
Alexander Pierce: Mission report. [Bucky; looking blank, doesn't respond] Mission report, now. [Pierce moves closer to Bucky and suddenly strikes him hard in the face]
Bucky Barnes: The man on the bridge... [he has flashback to Steve calling him by his name] Who was he?
Alexander Pierce: You met him earlier this week on another assignment.
Bucky Barnes: I knew him. [Pierce sits in front of Bucky]
Alexander Pierce: Your work has been a gift to mankind. You shaped the century, and I need you to do it one more time. Society is at a tipping point between order and chaos. Tomorrow morning we're gonna give it a push. But, if you don't do your part, I can't do mine, and HYDRA can't give the world the freedom it deserves.
Bucky Barnes: But I knew him. [Pierce turns to the scientists]
Alexander Pierce: Prep him.
Scientist #1: He's been out of cryo-freeze too long.
Alexander Pierce: Then wipe him and start over. [the scientists strap Bucky in his chair and then place a teeth shield in his mouth as they begin the process of wiping his brain with Bucky screaming in pain]
[back at the secret facility]
Nick Fury: [looking at a photo of Pierce] This man declined the Nobel Peace Prize. He said, "Peace wasn't an achievement, it was a responsibility." See, it's stuff like this that gives me trust issues.
Natasha Romanoff: We have to stop the launch.
Nick Fury: I don't think the Council's accepting my calls anymore. [Fury opens a case containing three chips]
Sam Wilson: What's that?
Maria Hill: Once the Helicarriers reach three thousand feet, they'll triangulate with Insight satellites becoming fully weaponized.
Nick Fury: We need to breach those carriers and replace their targeting blades with our own.
Maria Hill: One or two won't cut it. We need to link all three carriers for this to work, because if even one of those ships remains operational a whole lot of people are gonna die.
Nick Fury: We have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is HYDRA. We need to get pass them, insert the server blades, and maybe, just maybe, we can salvage what's left...
Steve Rogers: We're not salvaging anything. We're not just taking down the carriers, Nick, we're taking down SHIELD.
Nick Fury: SHIELD had nothing to do with it.
Steve Rogers: You gave me this mission, this is how it ends. SHIELD's been compromised, you said so yourself. HYDRA grew right under your nose and nobody noticed.
Nick Fury: Why do you think we're meeting in this cave? I noticed.
Steve Rogers: And how many paid the price before you did?
Nick Fury: Look, I didn't know about Barnes.
Steve Rogers: Even if you have, would you have told me? Or would you have compartmentalized that too? SHIELD, HYDRA, it all goes.
Maria Hill: He's right. [Fury looks at Natasha then Sam]
Sam Wilson: Don't look at me. I do what he does, just slower.
Nick Fury: Well... Looks like you're giving the orders now, Captain.
[Steve stands on a bridge and has a flashback to the time he spent with Bucky after Steve's mother's funeral]
Bucky Barnes: We looked for you after. My folks wanted to give you a ride to the cemetery. [they walk towards Steve's apartment]
Steve Rogers: I know, I'm sorry. I just...kind of wanted to be alone.
Bucky Barnes: How was it?
Steve Rogers: It was okay. She's next to Dad.
Bucky Barnes: I was gonna ask...
Steve Rogers: I know what you're gonna say, Buck, I just...
Bucky Barnes: We can put the couch cushions on the floor like when we were kids. It'll be fun. All you gotta do is shine my shoes, maybe take out the trash. [as they get to the apartment door, Steve tries to find his keys, Bucky kicks a brick aside, picks up the apartment keys from under it and gives it to Steve] Come on.
Steve Rogers: Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own.
Bucky Barnes: The thing is, you don't have to. [Bucky gives Steve a friendly pat on the shoulder] I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.
[Steve's thoughts of Bucky are interrupted as Sam joins him on the bridge]
Sam Wilson: He's gonna be there, you know?
Steve Rogers: I know.
Sam Wilson: Look, whoever he used to be, the guy he is now, I don't think he's the kind you save. He's the kind you stop.
Steve Rogers: I don't know if I can do that.
Sam Wilson: Well, he might not give you a choice. He doesn't know you.
Steve Rogers: He will. Gear up, it's time. [Steve turns and starts to walk off]
Sam Wilson: You gonna wear that?
Steve Rogers: No. If you're gonna fight a war, you gotta wear a uniform. [later as a guard walks in the Smithsonian Museum when he looks over to the Captain America exhibit he notices the Captain America WWII uniform on that was on the dummy has been stolen]
Smithsonian Guard: Oh, man. I am so fired!
[at the Triskelion where the Helicarriers are being held]
Man on PA: We are in final launch sequence.
SHIELD Tech: We are go on guidance.
Woman on PA: All personnel to launch station.
[Pierce meets the World Security Council as they arrive at the Triskelion]
Alexander Pierce: And how was your flight?
Councilman Hawley: Lovely. The ride from the airport less so.
Alexander Pierce: Sadly, SHIELD can't control everything.
Councilman Rockwell: Including Captain America. [Pierce walks over to one of the guards who hands him a case containing four pins]
Alexander Pierce: This facility is biometrically controlled, and these will give you unrestricted access. [the council members each take a pin to wear]
[at the Project Insight headquarters]
Com Tech #1: I've been parking there for two months.
Com Tech #2: But it's his spot.
Com Tech #1: So where's he been?
Com Tech #2: I think Afghanistan.
Com Tech #1: [into his earpiece] Negative, DT-6. The pattern is full. [to his colleague] Well, he could have said something. [suddenly they hear a sharp noise through their earpiece] Ow!
Com Tech #2: Must be the dish.
Com Tech #1: I'll check it out.
Man on PA: Triskelion command request we clear the area for launch.
[as the Tech goes and opens the door he's faced with Steve, Sam and Hill on the other side of the door, Sam and Hill point their guns at him]
Steve Rogers: Excuse us. [the tech holds his hands up and steps aside to let them enter]
Alexander Pierce: [addressing the World Security Council members] I know the road hasn't exactly been smooth, and some of you would have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way. Finally we're here, and the world should be grateful. [as they start drinking to Pierce's toast suddenly they hear Steve over the SHIELD microphone that everyone in the building can hear]
Steve Rogers: Attention, all SHIELD agents. This is Steve Rogers. You've heard a lot about me over the last few days, some of you were even ordered to hunt me down. But I think it's time you know the truth. SHIELD is not what we thought it was, it's been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The STRIKE and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building. They could be standing right next to you. They almost have what they want: absolute control. They shot Nick Fury and it won't end there. If you launch those Helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way, unless we stop them. I know I'm asking a lot, but the price of freedom is high, it always has been, and it's a price I'm willing to pay. And if I'm the only one, then so be it. But I'm willing to bet I'm not. [as Steve finishes his speech]
Sam Wilson: Did you write that down first, or was it off the top of your head? [to Pierce after learning the truth about him]
Councilman Rockwell: You smug son of a bitch.
Councilman Singh: [to the two HYDRA agents enter the room, thinking they are SHIELD agents] Arrest him. [the HYDRA agent points his gun at Singh]
Alexander Pierce: I guess I've got the floor.
[Rumlow and his men break into the control room, where Agent 13 also is, Rumlow walks over to one of the techs]
Brock Rumlow: Preempt the launch sequence. Send those ships up now. [The tech hesitates visibly.] Is there a problem?
SHIELD Tech: I'm... [the tech shakes his head nervously]
Brock Rumlow: Is there a problem?
SHIELD Tech: I'm sorry, sir. [the tech takes a few nervous breaths before replying] I'm not gonna launch those ships. Captain's orders. [Rumlow points his gun at the tech's head]
Brock Rumlow: Move away from your station. [Agent 13 walks over to Rumlow pointing her gun at him]
Sharon Carter: Like he said! [suddenly all the SHIELD agents draw their weapons and point them at Rumlow] Captain's orders.
Brock Rumlow: You picked the wrong side, Agent.
Sharon Carter: Depends on where you're standing. [Rumlow drops his gun, but as he does he grabs his knife and cuts Agent 13's arm, leading to the SHIELD agents firing their guns, amidst the bullets, Rumlow manages to release the Helicarriers and runs off]
[as the bay doors holding the Helicarriers are about to be opened]
SHIELD Agent: Close the bay door! Close the bay door now! Close the bay door! [the HYDRA agents enter and start shooting and killing the crew and techs; at the headquarters Hill watches on the monitor as the Helicarriers are being initiated]
Maria Hill: They're initiating launch.
[Steve and Sam make their way to the Helicarriers]
Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap, how do we know the good guys from the bad guys?
Steve Rogers: If they're shooting at you, they're bad. [Sam, in his Falcon suit, flies off and Steve heads down, the HYDRA agents starting shooting at them, Sam flies around avoiding getting shot]
Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap, I found those bad guys you were talking about.
Steve Rogers: You okay?
Sam Wilson: [flying off as the HYDRA agents continue to shoot at him] I'm not dead yet.
[Pierce watches from the window the commotion caused by Steve and Sam trying to stop the Helicarriers launching, he turns to Singh]
Alexander Pierce: Let me ask you a question. What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow, and you knew that they were gonna drag your daughters into a soccer stadium for execution? [Pierce hands Singh a glass of champagne] And you could just stop it with a flick of the switch. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you all?
Councilman Singh: Not if it was your switch. [Singh tosses the glass aside, one of the HYDRA agents hands Pierce his gun and Pierce points it at Singh, suddenly Hawley kicks Singh away, then takes down the other HYDRA agents in the room before taking the gun and pointing at Pierce, she then removes her disguise to reveal it's Natasha]
Natasha Romanoff: I'm sorry. Did I step on your moment?
Charlie Weapons Tech: [referring to the Helicarriers] Satellites in range at three thousand feet.
Maria Hill: Falcon, status?
Sam Wilson: Engaging. [Sam manages to fly down to the Hellicarrier bay taking down the HYDRA jets chasing him] Alright, Cap, I'm in. [just then another HYDRA jets heads his way and starts shooting at him] Shit! [Sam manages to fly off and avoid getting hit, meanwhile Steve is fighting off the HYDRA agents as he tries to get inside the Helicarrier]
Maria Hill: Eight minutes, Cap.
Steve Rogers: Working on it.
Councilman Rockwell: [to Natasha who is on the computer] What are you doing?
Alexander Pierce: She's disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the Internet.
Natasha Romanoff: Including HYDRA's.
Alexander Pierce: And SHIELD's. If you do this, non of your past is gonna remain hidden. [Natasha continues typing into the computer] Are you sure you're ready for the world to see you as you really are?
Natasha Romanoff: Are you?
[Control center of Helicarrier Alpha]
Steve Rogers: Alpha locked.
Maria Hill: Falcon, where are you now?
Sam Wilson: I had to take a detour! [Sam is flying towards one of the Helicarriers when heat-seeking missiles are shot at him by HYDRA, so he flies back towards the Helicarrier and manages to get the missiles that were aimed at him to hit the Helicarrier giving him entrance] Oh, yeah! [Sam flies into the Helicarrier; to Hill] I'm in. Bravo locked. [Sam flies out of the carrier]
Maria Hill: Two down, one to go.
SHIELD Pilot: All SHIELD pilots, scramble. We're the only air support Captain Rogers has got. [suddenly Bucky appears and starts firing at the SHIELD pilots and agents killing them all after which he gets into one of the jets and flies off; back inside the building with Natasha, Pierce and the council members]
Alexander Pierce: Disabling the encryption is an executive order, it takes two Alpha Level members.
Natasha Romanoff: Don't worry, company's coming. [just then a helicopter appears outside, lands and Fury steps out to enter the building to Pierce's surprise]
Alexander Pierce: Did you get my flowers? [Fury looks at him coldly] I'm glad you're here, Nick.
Nick Fury: Really? Cause I thought you had me killed.
Alexander Pierce: You know how the game works.
Nick Fury: So why make me head of SHIELD?
Alexander Pierce: Cause you were the best and the most ruthless person I ever met.
Nick Fury: I did what I did to protect people.
Alexander Pierce: Our enemies are your enemies, Nick. Disorder, war. It's just a matter of time before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMP fries Chicago. Diplomacy? Holding action, a band-aid. And you know where I learned that; Bogota. You didn't ask, you just did what had to be done. I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people by sacrificing twenty million. It's the next step, Nick, if you have the courage to take it.
Nick Fury: No, I have the courage not to. [Fury takes Pierce to the retinal scanner with Natasha pointing her gun at him]
SHIELD Computer: Retinal scanner active.
Alexander Pierce: You don't you think we wiped your clearance from the system?
Nick Fury: I know you erased my password, probably deleted my retinal scan, but if you want to stay ahead of me, Mr. Secretary... [Fury removes his eyepatch to reveal his scarred dead eye] You need to keep both eyes open. [they both look into the retinal scanner with Fury using his dead eye]
SHIELD Computer: Alpha Level confirmed. Encryption code accepted. Safeguards removed.
[back with Hill at the headquarters]
Maria Hill: Charlie Carrier's forty-five degrees off the port bow. [she notices two HYDRA agents making breaking into the headquarters, she shoots and kills them as they enter] Six minutes. [Steve is trying to get away from the HYDRA agents shooting at him on the Helicarrier]
Steve Rogers: Hey, Sam, I'm gonna need a ride.
Sam Wilson: Roger! Let me know when you're ready. [Steve just manages to jump off the edge as a HYDRA agent shoots a missile at him]
Steve Rogers: I just did! [Sam flies in just in time to catch Steve] [Sam flies himself and Steve onto the last Helicarrier]
Sam Wilson: You know, you're a lot heavier than you look.
Steve Rogers: I had a big breakfast. [suddenly Bucky appears and pushes Steve off the edge]
Sam Wilson: Steve! [as Sam goes to fly off and help Steve Bucky grabs one of his wings and throws him back, Sam starts shooting at Bucky and as he goes to fly off Bucky uses his weapon to rip off one of Sam's wings and kicks him off the Helicarrier, Sam manages to get his parachute out and lands on the roof of the Triskelion] Cap? Cap, come in. Are you okay? [we see Steve is holding onto the side of the Helicarrier]
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I'm here! I'm still on the Helicarrier. [he pulls himself up] Where are you?
Sam Wilson: I'm grounded, the suit's down. Sorry, Cap.
Steve Rogers: Don't worry, I got it. [Bucky watches Steve from above the Helicarrier] [as everyone at the Triskelion is rushing around trying to evacuate the building Rumlow fights and kills some SHIELD agents]
SHIELD Agent: All SHIELD agents regroup at Rally Point Delta. [Romlow kills the speaker and another three agents.]
HYDRA Dispatch: [on radio] Sir, Council's been breached.
Brock Rumlow: Repeat, dispatch.
HYDRA Dispatch: Black Widow's up there.
Brock Rumlow: Headed up! [Hill notices Rumlow on the monitor]
Maria Hill: Falcon?
Sam Wilson: Yeah?
Maria Hill: Rumlow's headed for the Council.
Sam Wilson: I'm on it.
[inside the Helicarrier Steve is confronted by Bucky]
Steve Rogers: People are gonna die, Buck. I can't let that happen. [Bucky stares at him coldly] Please, don't make me do this. [seeing Bucky won't back down Steve throws his shield at him and they start battling each other, as they fight Steve manages to bring up the targeting blade system, but as Bucky attacks him the chip falls from Steve's hand; back at the Council]
Natasha Romanoff: Done. [she looks at her mobile device] And it's trending. [just then Pierce sets off the pins he gave the council members, causing it to burn deeply into their sternum, Natasha and Fury points their guns at Pierce; to Natasha]
Alexander Pierce: Unless you want two inch hole in your sternum, I'd put that gun down. [Natasha doesn't back down] That was armed the moment you pinned it on. [Fury and Natasha reluctantly lower their weapons]
[back at the Helicarrier as they are battling it out, Bucky stabs Steve in the shoulder with his knife and then grabs the fallen chip, but Steve manages to get the knife out, grab Bucky by the throat and throws him down, armlocks him.]
Steve Rogers: Drop it! Drop it! [as Bucky continues to hold the chip, Steve breaks his arm and holds onto his throat until he passes out and lets go of the chip, Steve then grabs the chip and rushes off; back at the Triskelion]
[An office in the SHIELD HQ]
Brock Rumlow: I'm on forty-one, headed towards the south-west stairwell. [just then Sam attacks Rumlow but Rumlow manages to knock Sam down] This is gonna hurt. There are no prisoners with HYDRA, just order. And order only comes through pain. You ready for yours?
Sam Wilson: Man, shut the hell up. [they both go to attack each other]
Alexander Pierce: Lieutenant, how much longer?
Charlie XO: [on radio] Sixty-five seconds to satellite link. Targeting grid engaged. Lowering weapons array now.
Maria Hill: [to Steve as she watches from the monitor] One minute. [Steve desperately tries to get back up to the Helicarriers to get to the targeting system when Bucky becomes conscious and shoots at Steve in the left thigh and then the right shoulder, but Steve still manages to climb up] Thirty seconds, Cap!
Steve Rogers: Stand by. [he gets the chip out] Charlie... [Bucky shoots Steve in the stomach and he falls]
[On the helicarrier's bridge]
Charlie Weapons Tech: We've reached three thousand feet. Sat link coming online now.
Charlie XO: Deploy algorithm.
Charlie Weapons Tech: Algorithm deployed.
Alexander Pierce: [on radio] We are go to targets. [Hill watches as the weapons are being targeted at Washington, the White house, the Pentagon, Stark Tower, aiming to kill over 700,00 people.]
Charlie Weapons Tech: Target saturation reached. All targets assigned.
Charlie XO: Fire when ready.
Charlie Weapons Tech: Firing in, three, two, one. [at that moment Steve manages to get up and place the chip in the Helicarrier's targeting blade overriding the system and locking it down]
Steve Rogers: Charlie locked. [as they watch the targets go offline]
Charlie XO: Where are the targets? Where are the targets?
Maria Hill: Okay, Cap, get out of there. [Hill then gets the Helicarriers weapon targets to open fire upon each other]
Steve Rogers: Fire now.
Maria Hill: But, Steve...
Steve Rogers: Do it! Do it now! [reluctantly Hill makes the Helicarriers open fire on each other, Steve still inside the Helicarrier looks at Bucky below him; back at the Triskelion Pierce watches the Helicarriers as they are firing at each other]
Alexander Pierce: What a waste.
Natasha Romanoff: Are you still on the fence about Rogers' chances?
Alexander Pierce: Time to go, Councilwoman. This way, come on. You're gonna fly me out of here. [as Pierce starts to leave with Natasha]
Nick Fury: You know, there was a time I would have taken a bullet for you.
Alexander Pierce: You already did. You will again when it's useful. [just then Natasha activates a small disc that emits an electric shock through her whole body and disables the pin, this gives Fury a chance to shoot Pierce, which he does so twice, Fury then walks over to Natasha who is lying unconscious on the floor]
Nick Fury: Romanoff! Natasha! Natasha, come on! [Natasha opens her eyes]
Natasha Romanoff: Ow. Those really do sting.
Alexander Pierce: [as the Helicarriers continue to destroy each other Pierce lies on the floor and says with his last dieing breath] Hail HYDRA. [just then one Helicarrier crashes into a dam beneath the Triskelion] [as the Helicarrier continues to fall with Cap and Winter Soldier inside, at the Triskelion Sam and Rumlow continue to fight each other]
Brock Rumlow: You're out of your depth, kid. [suddenly the first Helicarrier crashes into the Triskelion, catching Rumlow in the destruction]
Sam Wilson: [to Natasha who is in the helicopter as he sprints away] Please, tell me you got that chopper in the air!
Natasha Romanoff: Sam, where are you?
Sam Wilson: 41st floor, north-west corner!
Natasha Romanoff: We're on it, stay where you are. [Sam desperately tries to get away from the destruction the Helicarrier is causing to the building] Not an option! [as the building is being destroyed Sam jumps out of the window as Natasha and Fury fly their chopper barely in time to catch him]
Sam Wilson: 41st floor! 41st!
Nick Fury: It's not like they put the floor numbers on the outside of the building!
Natasha Romanoff: Hill, where's Steve? You got a location on Rogers?
[inside the third Helicarrier we see Steve help Bucky out from being trapped under some fallen rubble]
Steve Rogers: You know me. [Bucky lashes out at Steve in anger]
Bucky Barnes: No, I don't!
Steve Rogers: Bucky, you've known me your whole life. [Bucky hits Steve but Steve chooses not to fight back] Your name is James Buchanan Barnes. [Bucky hits Steve again]
Bucky Barnes: Shut up! [Steve takes off his mask and drops his shield out of the Helicarrier]
Steve Rogers: I'm not gonna fight you. You're my friend. [Bucky pushes Steve to the ground]
Bucky Barnes: You're my mission. [he then mercilessly punches Steve repeatedly across the face] You're my mission!
Steve Rogers: Then finish it. [Bucky hesitates holding his fist up] Cause I'm with you to the end of the line. [Bucky looks at Steve as if he's starting to remember just then the bottom of the Helicarrier falls sending Steve down into the river below as Bucky watches from the Helicarrier, then we see an unconscious Steve being pulled out of the water and dragged onto the shore by Bucky before he turns and walks away]
[In a hospital, in a room guarded by two armed agents, we see Steve waking up in a bed to hear Marvin Gaye's "Trouble Man" playing with Sam sat next to his bed]
Steve Rogers: On your left. [Sam looks at Steve and smiles]
[we then see Agent 13 practicing shooting at a shooting range wearing a CIA t-shirt; we see Hill at Stark Industries about to undergo a lie detector test; then Senator Stern getting arrested and then a badly burnt Rumlow being treated by doctors at the hospital; Natasha is then being sworn in at a committee hearing]
Bailiff: Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth?
Natasha Romanoff: I do.
Committee General: Why haven't we yet heard from Captain Rogers?
Natasha Romanoff: I don't know what there is left left for him to say. I think the wreck in the middle of the Potomac made his point fairly eloquently.
Committee General: Well, he could explain how this country's expected to maintain its national security now that he and you have laid waste to our intelligence apparatus.
Natasha Romanoff: HYDRA was selling you lies, not intelligence.
Committee General: Many of which you seem to have had a personal hand in telling.
Scudder: Agent, you should know that there are some on this committee who feel, given your service record, both for this country and against it, that you belong in a penitentiary, not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.
Natasha Romanoff: You're not gonna put me in a prison. You're not gonna put any of us in a prison. You know why?
Scudder: Do enlighten us.
Natasha Romanoff: Because you need us. Yes, the world is a vulnerable place, and yes, we helped make it that way. But we're also the ones best qualified to defend it. So if you want to arrest me, arrest me. You'll know where to find me. [she gets up and walks away, meanwhile Fury gets rid of any trace of his existence, including his passports and eyepatch, burning them and his hiding place]
Nick Fury: [wearing sunglasses and hoodie, Fury meets Steve and Sam at a cemetery at his own grave] So, you've experienced this sort of thing before?
Steve Rogers: You get used to it. [we see Fury's gravestone which bears bears the epitaph "The path of the righteous man. Ezekiel 25:17"]
Nick Fury: We've been data-mining HYDRA's files. Looks like a lot of rats didn't go down with the ship. I'm headed to Europe tonight, wanted to ask if you'd come.
Steve Rogers: There's something I gotta do first.
Nick Fury: How about you, Wilson? Could use a man with your abilities.
Sam Wilson: I'm more of a soldier than a spy.
Nick Fury: Alright then. [Sam and Steve shake Fury's hand] Anybody asks for me, tell them they can find me right here. [Fury looks to his gravestone and walks away, just then Natasha joins Steve and Sam]
Natasha Romanoff: You should be honored, that's about as close as he gets to saying thank you.
Steve Rogers: Not going with him?
Natasha Romanoff: No.
Steve Rogers: Not staying here?
Natasha Romanoff: I blew all my covers, I gotta go figure out a new one.
Steve Rogers: That might take a while.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm counting on it. That thing you asked for, I called in a few favors from Kiev. [she hands Steve a file titled "дело No 17" (file No 17)] Will you do me a favor? Call that nurse.
Steve Rogers: She's not a nurse.
Natasha Romanoff: And you're not a SHIELD agent.
Steve Rogers: What was her name again?
Natasha Romanoff: Sharon. She's nice. [she kisses Steve on the cheek and turns to walk away] Be careful, Steve. You might not want to pull on that thread. [as Natasha walks away Steve opens the file, which is about Bucky and the information regarding his Winter Soldier transformation, Sam walks over to Steve]
Sam Wilson: You're going after him?
Steve Rogers: You don't have to come with me.
Sam Wilson: I know. When do we start?
[mid-credits scene; at an underground HYDRA lab Baron Wolfgang von Strucker is talking with a HYDRA scientist]
List: It's over. Fury has released everything to the public.
Baron Wolfgang von Strucker: Everything he knows about.
List: Herr Strucker, if they get word of our work here, if they find out we serve HYDRA...
Baron Wolfgang von Strucker: HYDRA, SHIELD, two sides of a coin that's no longer currency. [they walk over to the corner of the lab where Loki's scepter is being kept] What we have is worth more than any of them ever knew. We've only scratched the surface and already... [they start walking out of the lab] There are other facilities doing HYDRA's good work around the world. We'll feed them to Captain America and his colorful friends. Keep them off our scent.
List: What about the volunteers?
Baron Wolfgang von Strucker: The dead will be buried so deep their own ghosts won't be able to find them.
List: And the survivors?
Baron Wolfgang von Strucker: The twins. [we see the twins, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, aka Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, being kept in glass cells each exhibiting their powers, Pietro having superhuman speed and Wanda having telekinetic powers] Sooner or later they will meet the twins. It's not a world of spies anymore, not even a world of heroes. This is the age of miracles, doctor. There's nothing more horrifying than a miracle.
(The post-credits scene; at the Captain America exhibit in the Smithsonian Museum we see Bucky in civilian clothes staring pensively at the display about himself.)
